        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to wish him every success in discharging his important duties. We are also grateful to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for all his hard work in presiding over the Assembly at its seventieth session.\nA year ago we gathered here to witness the adoption of a comprehensive and people-centred post-2015 development agenda. There are milestones in history when universal values are translated into political commitments that change the course of events. We hope that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be one such milestone. When we reached an agreement on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we drew on the success story of the Millennium Development Goals, which proved to be instrumental in promoting development worldwide.\nAzerbaijan has integrated SDG targets into its national development strategy and continues to implement large-scale programmes on improving good governance, fostering sustainable growth, strengthening the rule of law, ensuring respect for human rights, facilitating access to public services and promoting inclusive societies. Despite the global economic crisis and the sharp decline in oil prices, Azerbaijan has managed to maintain its economic growth. Sustainable economic growth has enabled Azerbaijan not only to focus on its national development strategy, but also to actively support international development. Azerbaijan has rendered international humanitarian and development assistance to a number of countries through the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and the Azerbaijan International Development Agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nIn June, Azerbaijan was elected to join the Economic and Social Council for the years 2017 to 2019, after a vote at the General Assembly in which 176 of 184 Member States took part. Since the Economic and Social Council is the central platform for professional deliberations on sustainable development, we will have yet another opportunity to contribute to international development.\nTo advance SDG 16, Azerbaijan drew up a draft resolution entitled \u201cPrevention of corruption by promoting transparent, accountable and efficient public service delivery through the application of best practices and technological innovations\u201d, which was unanimously adopted at the sixth session of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, held from 2 to 6 November 2015.\nAgainst the background of the various threats and challenges facing the world nowadays, it is critical to consistently promote the value of different cultures, enhancing understanding among diverse communities and fostering mutual respect. Located between the two great continents of Asia and Europe, Azerbaijan is a unique place, where East and West meet, where the world\u2019s main religions peacefully coexist and where the values and traditions of different cultures harmoniously complement each other. It is no coincidence that the seventh Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations was held this year in my country.\nUnresolved armed conflicts, terrorism, violent extremism, aggressive separatism, intolerance and discrimination on ethnic and religious grounds continue to represent the most serious challenges to development and are some of its most persistent obstacles. The outcome document of the United Nations summit at which the post-2015 development agenda was adopted states that there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development, recalling the rights and obligations of States under international law and reaffirming the need to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of States.\nSince the last general debate, no substantive progress has been made in the settlement of the Armenia- Azerbaijan conflict. Armenia continues to occupy Azerbaijani territory, including the Nagorno Karabakh region and seven adjacent districts, in flagrant violation of international law and Security Council resolutions 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993). It is unfortunate that its engagement in the conflict-settlement process is nothing but a travesty.\nAzerbaijan does not have access to the economic potential of the occupied territory. The disruption of communications \u2014 as a direct consequence of the military occupation of our territory \u2014 is a serious obstacle to the full-fledged socioeconomic development of the country as a whole. Further, the region\u2019s untapped prospects for economic development are going unfulfilled, particularly in terms of intra- and transregional connectivity.\nThe humanitarian consequences of the conflict have been equally grim, which makes urgent solutions necessary. As a direct impact of the massive displacement of people from their places of origin, close to 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons continue to be deprived of their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, most notably the right to have access to their homes and property. Further continuation of this situation is intolerable.\nArmenia\u2019s policy and practices in the occupied territory of Azerbaijan undermine the prospects of achieving a political settlement of the conflict and pose an imminent threat to the peace, security and stability of the region. The Republic of Azerbaijan has made it clear on numerous occasions that the unlawful presence of Armenia\u2019s armed forces in the occupied Azerbaijani territory is a major factor in destabilizing the region. It has the potential of escalating at any time, with unpredictable consequences. It is also the main cause of tensions and incidents in the conflict zone.\nInstead of engaging in negotiations in good faith, Armenia demonstrably disrupts any attempt to settle the conflict by peaceful means. In total disregard of Security Council demands and in flagrant violation of international law, Armenia refuses to withdraw its troops from Azerbaijan, prevents hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced Azerbaijanis from returning to their homes and tries to further consolidate the status quo by altering the physical, demographic and cultural character of the occupied territories \u2014 a worrying development that was confirmed by a number of fact-finding missions conducted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Furthermore, Armenia frequently resorts to armed provocations in an attempt to divert attention from the core, substantive issues of the peace process, trying, instead, to put focus on the technical aspects of the ceasefire.\nRecently, in early April 2016, Armenia conducted large-scale attacks against the civilian population of Azerbaijan. It subjected densely populated areas of Azerbaijan, including schools, hospitals and places of worship, to intensive fire from heavy artillery and large-calibre weapons. As a result of these reckless attacks, large numbers of Azerbaijani civilians, including children, women and the elderly, were killed or seriously wounded. Had effective civil defence measures not been used in a timely manner, the number of casualties would have been significantly higher. Armenia also systematically mutilated the bodies of fallen Azerbaijani soldiers. During those attacks, 34 towns and villages in Azerbaijan suffered severe destruction. Substantial damage was inflicted upon private and public property, including critical civilian infrastructure. In particular, hundreds of civilian buildings, among them residences, schools, kindergartens, cultural centres and other civilian facilities, were ruined.\nArmenia\u2019s direct and deliberate attacks against the Azerbaijani civilian population, as well as inhuman acts against Azerbaijani military servicemen during its offensive action in April, constitute yet another serious violation of international humanitarian and human rights law. By its deliberate offensive actions, Armenia has undermined the ceasefire regime established in 1994 and endangered the prospects for the political settlement of the conflict.\nHaving received an effective response from Azerbaijan, Armenia was forced to request a ceasefire, which was agreed pursuant to the mediation efforts of the Russian Federation on 5 April, in Moscow, at the meeting of the chiefs of defence of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite that agreement, Armenia continued to violate the ceasefire. After amassing forces in seized Azerbaijani territory and building heavily reinforced military fortifications, on 19 September, Armenia began intensive military activity in the occupied Aghdam district. Meanwhile, Armenia has continued to challenge and attempt to undermine the efforts of the international community, including those of the co-Chair countries of the OSCE Minsk Group, namely, the United States, Russia and France, which have been aimed at achieving a breakthrough in the peace talks and withdrawing Armenia\u2019s troops from the sovereign lands of Azerbaijan.\nArmenia must realize that exploiting the status quo and armed provocations is a grave miscalculation. Its hypocritical attempts to mislead the international community on the root causes of the conflict by representing themselves as the suffering party is doomed to fail. Azerbaijan expects Armenia to halt its military build-up in the occupied territory and engage in negotiations with Azerbaijan in good faith, so as to find a long-overdue political solution to the conflict. The conflict can be resolved only on the basis of Azerbaijan\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, as reflected, incidentally, in the resolutions of the Security Council. The sooner Armenia reconciles itself to this reality and withdraws its armed forces from the occupied territory of Azerbaijan, the earlier the conflict will be resolved. Armenia and its population will then benefit from the prospects of cooperation and economic development.\nMy country will spare no effort to achieve the settlement of the conflict and ensuring peace, justice and development in the region.\n"

        "file_text": "In 2015, we celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco by reflecting on the challenges facing us as an international community and our capacity to resolve them. A year later, the challenges and problems still persist and the same questions remain. Will we be able to bring dynamic, equitable and sustainable growth to our economies with the global economic crisis still upon us? Will we be able to manage migration effectively, on the basis of international law, at a time when the number of displaced people in the world is greater than it has ever been since the Second World War? Will we be able to promote peace and security in an increasingly unstable global and regional environment? Or are we going to allow the forces of nationalism, xenophobia and neoliberalism to dictate ineffective or dangerous responses to the challenges we face?\nIn that context, the main topic of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2014 the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2014 is more timely than ever. In recent years, Greece has been the member of the eurozone hit the hardest by the economic crisis and the austerity measures imposed to resolve it. As a front-line European Union (EU) State, it has faced the greatest migration flows to the EU since the Second World War. Greece has been at the centre of a region with increasing security challenges, with instability deepening in the Balkans and conflicts worsening in Ukraine in the North, Libya in the West and Syria in the East.\nSince I spoke here last year (see A/70/PV.22), Greece has faced these great crises standing strong. Today, our discussion is no longer about our surviving crises. Today, now that we have political and financial stability, we are focusing on ways of promoting economic growth, developing more effective and humane migration management and maintaining peace and security in our broader neighbourhood. Today, we speak about resolving challenges with an impact, not just Greece but in Europe and beyond.\nAt the economic level, after seven turbulent years of recession, Greece is now emerging from the deepest social and economic crisis in its post-war history. We are working hard to ensure sustainable, inclusive growth. Sometimes, despite our efforts, we take a step backwards, but we always strive to push forward to prove that a country that has lost 25 per cent of its gross domestic product in six years, and watched unemployment and poverty rates skyrocket, can stand on its feet; and to create a business-friendly environment that encourages investment and does away with the sins of corruption, patronage and parasitic business practices.\nAt the same time, we are confronting the serious social consequences that imposed austerity has inflicted on Greek society. Our absolute priority is to reduce unemployment as soon as possible to the average level for Europe through a new production paradigm that utilizes the potential of our highly educated human capital. At the same time, we are taking advantage of Greece\u2019s strategic position at the crossroads of three continents, so that it can establish itself as a hub for energy, trade and maritime and railway transportation in the region. We are promoting necessary reforms, while protecting the welfare State and labour rights. We are urging our partners to proceed to the finalization of the necessary measures for our debt reduction, in order to regain market confidence and prepare the way for our return to capital markets. The first signs that our planning is delivering are already reflected in the return to positive growth rates, the steady downward trend in unemployment, the positive public finance accounts and the revived investment interest from abroad.\nBesides the substantial economic challenge, the Greek people are confronting the enormous challenge of refugee and migration management, a challenge that, as we have already underlined, is global and has to be dealt with collectively, on the basis of our shared values.\nSince I spoke here last, over 1 million migrants have entered Greece. Nearly 60,000 migrants remain stranded in Greece today, after our northern borders were shut off through the unilateral action of other countries. An enormous political crisis has erupted in Europe, with increasingly strong xenophobic forces pushing forward their agenda and claiming that respect for international law is a luxury in Europe today and that people should be pushed back into the sea; that sharing the responsibility for hosting refugees is an unacceptable imposition and that front-line States alone should be host countries; and that our economic crisis is reason enough for us to betray our values.\nThose xenophobic forces received the answer they deserved, and that answer came from the Greek people. The people of Europe most hard hit by the economic crisis proved to the world that neither our values nor our humanity are conditional. Despite the calls for pushbacks, our coastguard has saved tens of thousands of lives, instead of endangering them. Despite the calls for violating the Geneva Convention, my country, whose asylum service did not exist three years ago, deals fairly and in accordance with the Geneva Convention with the fourth-largest number of asylum applications in Europe.\nTogether with Turkish and European authorities, we are implementing the very difficult, but necessary, European Union-Turkey agreement. It is an agreement that has led to a decrease in flows, but most important, a decrease in deaths in the Aegean Sea. It has replaced the dangerous route of the Aegean Sea with a legal one to Europe. In that context, today more than ever, we need a strong international initiative that will establish a new global framework for refugee management, thereby undercutting the xenophobic migration agenda. Such a framework must include increased support to countries hosting refugees, increased returns of people not in need of international protection, and the resettlement and relocation of those in need of such protection. Moreover, it must include increased security cooperation against trafficking networks and additional initiatives to tackle the root causes of migration.\nThe third big challenge that Greece is facing is how to contribute to peace, security and prosperity in an increasingly unstable region. Greece has been very clear in its response to this challenge. We have developed bilateral and, together with the Republic of Cyprus, trilateral relations with all our neighbours with a view to promoting peace, cooperation and international law. We have organized multilateral initiatives, such as the International Conference on Religious and Cultural Pluralism and Peaceful Coexistence in the Middle East and the Rhodes Conference on security in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. And we have consistently promoted these values, in all international organizations, in relation to all the conflicts in our broader region. Furthermore, we are confronting terrorism wherever it emerges and in relation to the conflicts in Syria, Libya and Ukraine and the Middle East peace process.\nToday, we have before us a very important challenge to substantially promote peace and stability in our region. We remain steadfast in our support to intercommunal talks for a just, viable and comprehensive solution to the Cyprus issue, on the basis of United Nations resolutions and the status of Cyprus as an EU member State \u2014 a solution that can be viable only if we leave behind the anachronistic guarantee system of the past and ensure a withdrawal of Turkish occupying forces from the island. We support a solution that would provide a sense of security and trust to all the people of Cyprus and prepare the ground for broader cooperation in our unstable region.\nWe have enhanced our dialogue and relations with Turkey through a wide range of initiatives, including our excellent cooperation in managing refugee and migration flows. And we have underlined that the only way to build solid, long-lasting neighbourly relations is by respecting international law. On the name issue of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, we consistently support a mutually acceptable compound name with a geographical qualifier for use in relation to everyone. And we have promoted confidence-building measures that aim to strengthen trust and cross-border cooperation at this crucial time.\nToday \u2014 unlike a year ago \u2014 the challenges we are facing in Greece are opportunities. They are opportunities for the international community, for Europe and for our region. They are opportunities to turn the page on the crisis of the past and avert new, dangerous crises. We need a just, viable solution in Cyprus that would contribute to changing the unstable dynamics of the region. That is why we need a solution to the debt issue that would contribute to a new sustainable growth model, of the kind we talk about so much here in the United Nations and in Europe, and would leave the vicious cycle of austerity behind.\nWe also need a global, effective response to the migration crisis, on the basis of international law. This must be a response that undercuts the dangerous xenophobic and nationalistic voices that are emerging so forcefully for the first time since the Second World War. Of course, backward-looking and ultra-conservative forces will attempt to provide solutions to these problems by investing in fear, sometimes labelling themselves anti-systemic forces. Nevertheless, it is very clear that it is not the democratic forces that are critical of the system that the international community should worry about. It is those forces that threaten our values and instead of aiming to change the world for better, aim to divide it through fear, xenophobia and nationalism. Today it is more important than ever to stand by peace, democracy and sustainable growth on all the fronts where they are being challenged, and in Greece we know that very well.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to stand here in front of such a distinguished audience, especially in 2016, the year marking the sixtieth anniversary of the 1956 uprising, when the Hungarian people rose up and fought for their freedom against the Communist oppressors. In 1956, Hungary did not receive external help and so our revolution and fight for freedom was defeated, but the heroic efforts of our freedom fighters gave us the strength to survive the dictatorship and to finally gain freedom in 1990.\nSo today I can stand here before everyone as a representative of a free and proud nation, a nation that is proud of its traditions, culture, Christianity and past struggles for freedom.\nObviously, at this rostrum we do not need to say that the world has expeienced enormous global challenges that have recently led to dramatic changes in the tradional world order. Let me just emphasize three of the important factors responsible for those changes. All of us have witnessed, and unfortunately experienced, the worldwide spread of terrorist organizations. Day by day we witness the destabilization of some key and vulnerable regions of the world. And day by day we face the fact that around 60 to 65 million people globally are on the move, or being displaced, for various reasons.\nThese three factors have led to dramatic changes in the world order. I think that it is no longer an exaggeration to say that this is the twenty-fourth hour and that there is but little time left for us to channel those changes in a positive direction. However, in order to reach this goal, all of us together have to be successful in carrying out three global policy initiatives.\nFirst of all, we must eliminate the key factor of global terrorism: the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Until we finally destroy ISIS, there will be no peace or stability in Europe\u2019s southern and south- eastern neighbourhoods, namely the Middle East and North Africa. Until we finally destroy ISIS, thousands upon thousands of people will continue to be forced to leave their homes. Until we finally destroy ISIS, Christian communities will continue to be threatened and will continue to suffer heavy attacks. Until we finally destroy ISIS, migratory pressure on Europe will not decrease.\nSecondly, we must eliminate the global network of human traffickers. We must destroy their business models and recognize that they have caused the deaths of thousands of innocent people. I am sure we can all agree that their crimes against humanity must not remain unpunished.\nThirdly, we must change the migration policies that inspire people to take their lives in their own hands to violate borders and to move to countries thousands of miles away. Migration is an extremely serious issue and challenge. That is why, instead of emotional debates, we need debates based on common sense and rationality. Instead of accusing and bashing each other, we must stand on the very stable basis of international law. I think it is especially pertinent to say that here, in this Hall. International law stipulates that the right to a safe life is a fundamental human right. But the option to pick which country to live in is not a fundamental human right. We must make it clear that there is no excuse for violating the border between two safe and peaceful countries.\nRegarding Hungary, I am proud to report that with the policies that we have been carrying out, we were able to contribute to appropriate responses to recent global challenges.\nFirst, Hungary is one of 23 countries that sent troops to fight ISIS. There are 143 Hungarian men and women serving in Iraq. They have been taking part in actions against ISIS as a force protection unit and as Peshmerga trainers. We have sent the Peshmerga army a significant amount of ammunition, and we have been taking part in the rehabilitation programme for wounded Peshmerga. We are also beginning to train Iraqi army officials. In that regard, I would like to mention that we urged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to start investigating crimes committed by ISIS against Christian communities. We regret and deplore that, despite letters sent to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC, no real action has been taken. We are also saddened that the Security Council was not ready to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC.\nI would like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that the Hungarian Government has established a State secretariat that monitors the position of Christian communities all over the world, determines whether they are being persecuted and organizes help for those communities whenever necessary. By doing so, we hope to prevent crimes committed against Christian communities from going unpunished.\nSecondly, regarding human trafficking, the Hungarian Parliament has adopted stringent regulations against human traffickers, which can serve as best practices in the global struggle against smuggling networks.\nThirdly, regarding migration, Hungary ranks the security of its people as its top priority. We have protected our borders thus far, and we will not allow any mass border violation in future. In that connection, we must make clear that migration policies all over the world have failed. Migration policies that consider all migrants to be refugees have failed. Migration policies that seek to force countries to host thousands of migrants against the will of their own citizens have failed. Migration policies based on accusing countries that protect their own borders have also failed.\nThe uncontrolled and unregulated mass migration has offered terrorist organizations the opportunity to send their fighters and their terrorists to other countries and continents. The outcome and consequence of the uncontrolled and unregulated mass migration in Europe is the growing threat of terror and the worsening of public security. It is obvious now that people in Europe expect their politicians to make the restoration of security a top European policy priority.\nOur position is absolutely clear \u2014 we must help those in need. We must help people to stay as close to their homes as possible, because that will allow them to return to their homes as soon as the crises are over. That is why we, the international community, have to support Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and the Kurdish regional Government in Iraq, because those countries and the Kurdish region have been taking care of millions of refugees. If we do not help them, and if those countries and that region become unstable, then the refugees will hit the road, risking their lives trying to reach Europe. Europe will be unable to meet such a challenge. Hungary has contributed \u20ac3 million to the Madad Fund and has made a \u20ac5 million pledge to build a hospital in Syria. We have also launched a special scholarship programme for youngsters from Syria to study in Hungary, because we must help those in need.\nWe must place conditions on our development projects and funding programmes. I think we have a right to expect beneficiary countries to carry out reforms and to create conditions that will encourage their people to stay in their homelands. The United Nations must play a vital role in settling those serious conflicts and in overcoming those serious challenges. But, in order for it to do so, we need credibility. Hungary has joined the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group because we believe that we must improve the accountability and transparency of the United Nations.\nThat is particularly true as it relates to the appointment process for the Secretary-General. We would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Lykketoft, for having ushered in the new phase of appointing the Secretary-General by organizing a hearing and for increasing the Assembly\u2019s role in that process.\nFinally, I would like to speak as a representative of a country from Central Europe. The Central European region must face some difficult and complicated challenges. There is a war in Ukraine that affects energy security; we have tensions in the western Balkan region; and we have to deal with the Russia/ Europe relationship. The Central and Eastern European countries form a group within the United Nations from which so far no Secretary-General has been chosen during the more than 70-year history of the Organization. This time, therefore, we are appealing to the generosity of the other four country groups in urging them to appoint a Secretary-General from Central Europe, who would understand the mindset of the people of Central Europe and their region and its challenges. Such a Secretary-General could be very helpful in enabling the Central European countries to overcome some of their historical tensions and issues.\nFinally, I have the honour to announce Hungary\u2019s candidature for the Human Rights Council for the 2017-2019 term. We are grateful to those countries that have already pledged to support us. I would like to emphasize here that we are ready to work together with our fellow States Members of the United Nations in order to contribute to making the United Nations human rights mechanisms more effective, with the goal of creating a better world for everyone.\n"

        "file_name": "ISL_71_2016.txt",
        "file_text": "At the end of the nineteenth century, one quarter of the Icelandic population emigrated to Canada and the United States. Iceland was one of the poorest countries in Europe, and people were seeking a better life for themselves and their families. The image of the struggling Icelander \u2014 crossing the ocean, seasick and hungry \u2014 is still embedded in the minds of our people. But we do know that many of our fellow countrymen achieved success in their new home. I truly believe that they have had a positive impact on their communities. The Icelandic migrants were not refugees. They were not fleeing war and disaster. But they were seeking safety and better lives for their families.\nToday, millions of people are displaced by conflict and disaster. The long-term goal of the international community must be to create peace where there is conflict and economic opportunities where there are none, so that countries of origin do not lose their human capital and people can stay safely in their homes. Today, we are faced with humanitarian crisis and we must all step up to the plate. Iceland \u2014 a country of only 330,000 people \u2014 has contributed to addressing the issue, both with funding to the relevant institutions and by welcoming a group of Syrian refugees. In the weeks to come, we are welcoming another group from Syria, bringing the overall number in 2016 to more than 100. For a small country, these numbers are big \u2014 the equivalent of 100,000 in the United States.\nThe Middle East and North Africa regions remain in conflict and crisis, often driven by injustice and human rights failures. The Syrian conflict continues to inflict suffering on millions. I strongly condemn the attack on the United Nations humanitarian convoy earlier this week and the new attacks on Aleppo. I also urge the conflicting parties, and especially the Syrian Government, to commit to finding a political solution. The suspected war crimes committed in this conflict threaten to undermine international law for the time to come. These war crimes must be prosecuted. Along with others, I praise the generosity of the neighbouring States \u2014 Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey \u2014 in addressing the issue.\nIt should be possible to resolve the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, but actions by both sides have continued to undermine the negotiation of a two-State solution. There is violence and provocation on both sides. Settlement expansion and the destruction of Palestinian structures undermine the basis for peace. The Security Council should take action to back the recommendations of the Quartet via a resolution. At the same time, we urge the parties to foster a climate of tolerance.\nThe sense of injustice and failure of governance is often at the root of other conflicts. The question of Western Sahara remains unresolved. We urge both sides to exercise restraint and to do their utmost to reduce tensions in line with United Nations resolutions.\nAfrica and the Middle East are the regions worst hit by terrorism and violent extremism. But no country is left untouched, and terrorism has returned to Europe. That is a vivid reminder for my region that other societies may harbour individuals with beliefs that can be turned into justifications for violence and terrorism. It is a global threat of massive scope and complexity. We must act together as a world community. We must improve United Nations coordination in dealing with terrorism and violent extremism. We must challenge narratives and ideologies together and identify internal and external drivers of violent extremism and terrorism.\nNelson Mandela said, Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\u201d Education is a precondition of good governance. If people do not know their rights or how to seek justice and do not understand the views of others, then building peaceful and inclusive societies is very difficult. Education remains a key pillar in Iceland\u2019s development cooperation. Over the past 70 years Icelandic society has developed from being a poor society to a modern, prosperous economy. We could not have done that if we had not ensured access for all to quality education at both secondary and higher levels.\nEducation shines a light on our path to ensuring human rights for all. In one century, women have seen great progress, even though the progress is uneven. I stand here today, one of only 30 or so female Foreign Ministers in the world, as proof that we have come a long way, yet not nearly far enough. Women\u2019s human rights lag severely behind in many countries, at great cost to women, men and society as a whole.\nWe have agreed that no one can be left behind. That includes every individual, no matter the colour of her or his skin, her or his disability or religion or whom she or he loves. If we want resilient and healthy societies, we must make it our business to safeguard the rights and interests of minority groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups.\nThe United Nations is the heart and soul of all international efforts. It is our responsibility to safeguard the Organization and ensure that it is ready for the challenges ahead. The new approach for appointing the Secretary-General raises the profile and standing of the United Nations. It is a major milestone to see such a strong field of women candidates. I would like to pay tribute to the former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Lykketoft, for his efforts to make the new approach work. It is now for the Security Council to propose to the General Assembly a candidate who has wide support, credibility and respect. I hope we will succeed in finding her or him.\nWe have set our sights high for the future of our planet. We have set goals to address climate change. We have mapped out a course to sustainable development that is universal, leaves no one behind and preserves our planet. The rules and objectives have been agreed \u2014 a major achievement. Now we have to implement them. With political will, knowledge-sharing and innovation, I am confident that we will succeed.\nA large number of States have already ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, thus paving the way for its early entry into force. In particular, I welcome the leadership shown by the United States of America and China. And I am proud to inform the Assembly that I handed over Iceland\u2019s instrument of ratification earlier this week.\nThe world\u2019s common road map to sustainable development \u2014 the 2030 Agenda \u2014 should be taped to the wall of every planning ministry. The Icelandic Government is keenly aware that the Agenda needs to concern every one of us. The Agenda presents challenges and opportunities to government, business and civil society in every country.\nIn Iceland we want to be sure of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on time. W are therefore setting up the structures and identifying the gaps to help us do that. Iceland aims to present its own national review in two years. Sharing ideas and knowledge will be a key element of our common success. For many years, Iceland has hosted United Nations University training programmes in four areas of importance to our agenda, namely, gender equality,\nsustainable geothermal energy, sustainable management of the oceans and combating desertification. We will continue to make a contribution in those areas of Icelandic expertise.\nTwenty-two years ago I lived in South Korea. To my surprise, I saw many similarities between Iceland and South Korea. Both countries rose from poverty to prosperity in only a few decades, and both gained independence in the 1940. And both are democracies and base their economic welfare on market economics.\nIn contrast, the people of North Korea still live in poverty, with a gross domestic product per capita equal to only 5 per cent of that of their cousins to the south. They experience higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy than their cousins, and even starvation. Severe human rights violations are committed by a dictatorship Government. It is shocking to see how the Government of North Korea continues its illegal pursuit of nuclear weapons, thereby risking not only the security of its own people and the entire region but also international security. Iceland strongly condemns North Korea\u2019s nuclear testing, which is in breach of universally accepted norms and international law.\nAs politicians we bear a heavy responsibility to govern to the best of our ability and in the interests of all people. Good governance is outlined in a key global goal. In many ways, it is the keystone of the 2030 Agenda.\nWhile each nation is sovereign, none of us is isolated from the world or world events. Yet we have seen powerful countries breach fundamental principles of international law by invading other States. International law is key to cross-country relations and the integrity of our global system. For a small and peaceful country like mine, international law is our sword, shield and shelter.\nIn 2006 nobody had heard of iPhones or tablets or apps, there were no apple slices at McDonald\u2019s, and Segways were seen only in science fiction movies. But 2006 brought two things that everyone in this building seems to love, namely, Twitter and Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is stepping down after 10 successful years as Secretary-General of the United Nations. During those years we have seen tremendous change. His personal commitment to fighting climate change has been a key factor in our reaching agreement. He has laid the groundwork for reforming United Nations peacekeeping operations. And he has shown strong leadership on gender issues. On behalf of Iceland, I would like to thank Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his extraordinary contribution as Secretary-General.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We would like to express our firm resolve to contribute to the success of his leadership and thereby to strengthening the Assembly\u2019s authority as the most representative and democratic organ of the United Nations.\nWe are in the sacred home of the multilateral system, representing a banner for fundamental principles in the international relations between sovereign and equal States. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela endorses the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which uphold respect for the right of States to self-determination, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity as the fundamental basis for ensuring peaceful coexistence among nations in the context of a multinational system. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council since January 2015, Venezuela has worked to reaffirm the primacy of sovereignty, political independence, self-determination and the peaceful resolution of disputes.\nA year ago, here in the General Assembly Hall, our Heads of State and Government adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with the ultimate goal of eradicating hunger and poverty, and noting that the Agenda must be people-centred, universal and transformative. However, I would like to focus our attention on the chief obstacle preventing the world from achieving those noble goals. The capitalist model is a huge impediment to our peoples\u2019 right to development. It creates profound inequalities and is a threat to the very existence of the planet and the human species. In the past 50 years, the consumption generated by capitalism has succeeded in melting the polar ice caps and creating unsustainable climate conditions on our planet. In the words of Pope Francis in his encyclical Laudato si\u2019, man\u2019s actions and his models of production and consumption have turned the planet into a huge garbage heap. That model is sustained and developed through the expansion of violence in its various manifestations, both in internal conflicts and widespread warfare.\nIn 2015 global military spending reached $1.7 trillion, one third of which \u2014 $600 billion, for some countries an almost unimaginably huge figure \u2014 was spent by the United States alone to finance its wars and acts of imperial aggression. The United States has about 800 military bases around the world, whose maintenance costs about $100 billion a year. It was not without reason that in 1968 Martin Luther King said that the United States is the largest exporter of violence in the world.\nThe death totals in conflicts over the past five centuries reveal the intrinsic link between violence and the expansion of capitalism. The sixteenth century saw 1.6 million people die as a result of conflict. The figure for the seventeenth century was 6.1 million; for the eighteenth, 7 million; for the nineteenth, 19.4 million, and for the twentieth, 109.7 million. That tragic story of deadly violence has gone hand in hand with the expansion of capitalism and its financial effects. The ratio of the victims of deadly violence as a percentage of the total population therefore increased over those five centuries from 0.32 to 4.35, making for an increasingly violent world. The forms that wars take today have also changed. Internal conflicts now predominate, and they happen more often in poor countries. To give just one example, a 2005 United Nations report cites a tragic figure illustrating the relationship between violence and capitalism \u2014 of the 3 million people killed by conflicts since 1990, 2 million were children.\nCapitalism is a serious threat to the future of humankind. Terrorism, that heinous expression of deadly violence, has also changed, becoming more violent and more widespread, attacking countries that are poor or have been ruined, and focusing on geopolitical ends in order to bring about the collapse of States and their institutions and to enable terrorists to expropriate their strategic resources illegally. Venezuela rejects terrorism in all its forms and condemns the double standard whereby the centres of hegemonic power establish an artificial dividing line for terrorism, which is good if it agrees with their desire to overthrow Governments that are not aligned with their interests, and bad when unwanted boomerang effects victimize their own populations.\nAs we have seen, capitalism is deadly for peace. In the past five centuries of the capitalist model\u2019s expansion, lethal violence has claimed ever more victims and significantly worsened inequalities. Its greatest contradiction is demonstrated by the fact that today the world produces enough to sustain every person on the planet; but that wealth ends up in just a few hands, and poverty is now concentrated mainly in the countries of the South and within those of the centre. The gap between rich and poor has therefore grown disproportionately. The case of the United States is compelling; between 1942 and 2010 the gap there tripled. To give an example, in 1978, the annual earnings of an average member of the working class and a top executive were $48,000 and $393,000, respectively. in 2010, that average worker made $33,000, while a senior executive was paid more than $1.1 million.\nAccording to Oxfam, 1 per cent of the world\u2019s inhabitants owns the same amount of wealth as 90 per cent of the rest. But the most significant part is that this figure is not uniform around the world. It is worse in developing countries and in some sectors even worse that that, where the chasm between those who are squandering the world\u2019s wealth and those who are dying of hunger is tragic. Concentrated capital has been turned into unproductive and speculative wealth that has a pernicious effect on economic sectors such as communications, energy, banking and investment, among others. It has become a way of increasing wealth without producing anything. It is a model based on violence, where peace has become a distant dream for humankind. To see that, we have only to consider the conflicts that are currently the worst threats to global peace and stability.\nThe question of Palestine is an ongoing issue for the whole of humankind. The daily lives of the Palestinian people, as they try to resist dreadful violence, are marked by war crimes and massive human rights violations. To give just one example, in 2000 the illegal occupation resulted in enormous setbacks to human development, with a poverty rate that went from 20 to 55 per cent in only three years. That figure has now worsened. We do not have the time needed to detail the numbers and types of violations of human rights that are being committed hourly against the Palestinian people.\nVenezuela supports Palestine\u2019s right of self- determination as a free, sovereign and independent State, and we therefore believe that the Organization must take the decision as soon as possible to admit it to the United Nations as a full-fledged State. We support the establishment of a State of Palestine within secure, internationally recognized pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We call on Israel to end its protracted occupation of territories belonging to the State of Palestine. The Israeli occupation of those territories and its related policies are the leading cause of violations of Palestinians\u2019 human rights and of international humanitarian law. Venezuela also calls for the definitive lifting of the illegal blockade that has been imposed on the Gaza Strip since 2007 and is a flagrant violation of the people\u2019s human rights. There will be no peace in the Middle East if Israel continues to deny the Palestinian people their human rights, including their right to self-determination.\nWith respect to Iraq, the rationale for the second invasion of the country, in 2003, had as its starting point a truth that, not only was not verified at the time but, years later, was acknowledged by the main invaders to be a lie. That military invasion was preceded by an effective propaganda campaign focused on four main areas. None of the arguments was true. The weapons of mass destruction that led to the invasion of Iraq never existed. What is traditionally referred to as intelligence became war propaganda. The large media corporations, acting like veritable monopolies for moulding public opinion, developed genuine campaigns that preceded and justified the imperialist interventions.\nWith respect to Libya, in 2011, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization carried out a military intervention, plunging the nation into violence, making it a victim of terrorist groups, reducing its human development index and disrupting its cooperation mechanisms with other neighbouring countries of Mother Africa. In the past, Libya maintained oil-production levels close to 1.6 million barrels per day. In August 2016, production hardly reached 260,000 barrels per day. Yet again, the imperialist obstinacy of the Western Powers curtails the right to development of peoples, the right to peace and the right to a homeland. Migration flows of Libyan citizens seeking a better future beyond its borders have also affected poverty levels in developed countries. The serious humanitarian situations in Afghanistan and Yemen also deserve equal mention.\nOn another note, the Syrian Arab Republic is waging a full-fledged war against the barbarism of the terrorism plaguing the country. The Syrian people are the primary victims of the violence perpetrated by terrorist groups, which are committing war crimes through the use of chemical weapons. Terrorism in Syria has caused one of the largest humanitarian tragedies in recent decades, which has resulted in 6 million internally displaced persons and 4.8 million refugees fleeing widespread violence to save their lives, regardless of the risks they face. The dramatic images of men, women and children trying to cross the Mediterranean reflect the gravity of the armed conflict in this Arab country caused by terrorist groups and violent opposition. Overcoming the humanitarian tragedy of 13.5 million Syrian citizens depends on terrorism being vanquished and a political and peaceful solution to the armed conflict that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that brother country.\nBy contrast, Venezuela welcomes the renewal of diplomatic relations between the United States and our sister Republic of Cuba as the only way to overcome and resolve the differences between the States. For decades, the Cuban people have resisted, with dignity and heroism, the ravages of State terrorism from the North whose aim it was to attack its development, political, social and cultural models. The Cuban people continue to be subjected to a criminal economic, commercial and financial blockade. Venezuela demands that the United States put an end to the blockade and offer compensation for the damage caused by such illegal and arrogant actions.\nThe United Nations system is facing major challenges. Sixteen years ago, at the Millennium Summit, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas said that the United Nations could not find its way with a map that was drawn in the historic moment following the end of the Second World War in 1945 (see A/55/PV.8). In order to successfully address the complex challenges in the areas of peace, stability and humankind\u2019s economic and social development, it is vital for the Organization to be renewed and strengthened, and that will be achieved by reforming its principal bodies. In that regard, we call for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council. In addition to other reforms to be undertaken within the Council itself, the Council should include developing countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia. As the General Assembly is the democratic and universal body par excellence of the Organization, our country reaffirms its position in favour of strengthening the authority of the Assembly in the various areas conferred to it by the Charter of the United Nations, namely, peace and security, economic and social development, human rights and international cooperation.\nBy contrast, approaches relying on double standards and the political use of human rights to justify interventionism in our countries in order to serve imperialist interests seriously undermine the Organization\u2019s institutions, making it a real challenge to safeguard and protect the human rights of peoples and not just individual rights and those of the global elites. It is urgent for the United Nations system to take measures against global Powers that, regardless of the rules and international law, mount attacks on Governments that express the will of their people.\nThe soon-to-be-elected new Secretary-General will face major challenges and so too will free and sovereign countries whose main responsibility is to work together towards a noble and imperious end. Venezuela thanks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to promote international peace and security. It must be acknowledged that the United Nations has made great contributions to humankind. Its intrinsic purposes of peace and security are founded on a strong multilateral system that sets the international rule of law by regulating relations among States. We join in the efforts to preserve the rule of law and advance towards a better system.\nJust days ago, in Margarita, we hosted the seventeenth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement. Venezuela chaired that important group of countries, with which we share the same concerns. We made significant progress and we remain committed to peace, development, solidarity and the welfare of our people, within the framework of the Bandung Principles on which our group was founded. In 1946, Albert Einstein asserted, \u201cI firmly believe that the majority of peoples in the world would prefer to live in peace and security\u201d. Humankind\u2019s desire for peace can be possible only by creating a global Government, to which the peoples of the South, who account for two thirds of the Members of the Organization, are firmly committed.\nIt should be noted that during the course of today\u2019s meeting, a United States plane violated Venezuelan airspace. This same day, United States aircraft attacked the Syrian national army, killing dozens of Syrians and wounding hundreds more. In that same time period, India was the victim of a terrorist attack, and the Palestinian people suffered violent attacks that left some of its citizens dead. As the Assembly can see, the peoples of the South, who possess the largest energy, mining, gas and water reserves on the planet, are the main victims of imperialist violence and aggression.\nOver a year ago, the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Hussein Obama, issued an executive order describing Venezuela as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. That executive order was rejected by most countries around the world. In addition, extreme and violent groups are supported and encouraged by the United States to sow the seeds of death in Venezuela by overthrowing the constitutional Government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros and employing multifaceted economic aggression and sophisticated methods to discredit and weaken the country and incite a media, trade and financial boycott. It is nothing that has not already been experienced in the past in our region, when our President Salvador Allende suffered the same attacks from the imperialist United States.\nWe warn the international community that Venezuela has been chosen as a new imperialist target in order to undermine its sovereignty and bring about its territorial disintegration, with a view to illegitimately and violently seizing the immense, strategic natural resources we possess. Imperialist history, replete with violence, is expected to be repeated \u2014 a major campaign of lies and fallacies is under way against Venezuela, its people and its Government. That agenda of aggression makes it an unconventional war aimed at criminalizing and penalizing our development model founded on the basis of twenty-first-century socialism that is profoundly inclusive, distributes wealth to the majority and is based on equality.\nOur continent has had very rocky relationships with the United States, which in service of its expansionism and imperial domination, subjugated and invaded many of our countries. Those dark pages of colonialism and subjugation have been overcome by the decision of our peoples to be free and independent. Nevertheless, new war drums are rumbling in the North, which aspires to revisiting and traversing the rocky roads our America has already travelled. We condemn the parliamentary judicial coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Brazil, and we reject the implementation of a new Operation Condor in our region, controlled from Washington. I would note that Venezuela is criticized for having one of the most equitable wealth distributions in Latin America, with a Gini coefficient of 0.38.\nIn 2005, UNESCO declared our country free of illiteracy. Today, our school enrolment, according to UNESCO, stands at 77 per cent for children ages 3 to 6, 96 per cent for ages 6 to 12, and 76 per cent for ages 12 to 18. We have 2.6 million students in higher education, placing us among the leading countries in the world in this regard. In 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) singled out Venezuela for its social policies to reduce hunger and poverty by over 50 per cent throughout its national territory. In 2015, the FAO once again praised the Government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros for the exceptional progress made in reducing hunger and poverty.\nIn our country, our free health-care plan is available to 75 per cent of the population, and will soon reach 100 per cent, thanks to a joint programme with our Cuban brothers. Our social-housing programme has benefitted 1,111,095 families. We have placed particular emphasis on protecting retired persons and the elderly. In 17 years, over 3 million persons in that age group have benefited from this programme.\nWe offer hope to the vast majority of people who are victims of a ruthless model of humanity. From Venezuela, we seek true peace among all peoples and the establishment of a new economic, cultural and communication model in service of peace, development and equality. We are developing partnerships through innovative mechanisms such as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our America and the PetroCaribe Energy Cooperation Agreement, which benefit the peoples of our region.\nWe also support the efforts of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa towards the establishment of a multipolar, multicentric world. From Venezuela, we wage permanent war on the capitalist system that perpetuates poverty, violence and unhappiness. We echo the words of our liberator, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, when we say that the most perfect system of Government is one which produces the greatest sum happiness, social security and political stability.\nLet us give the world the greatest possible sum happiness, social security and political stability. The time for peace with social justice is upon us. Let us change the system and become true militants for peace.\n"

        "file_text": "The migration and refugee crises are at the heart of our debate these days, both here and back home. People around the world are on the move in unprecedented numbers. Some 65 million have been forcibly displaced in the last year. At the summit on Monday, we made an important collective statement that should shape our policies \u2014 migration should be a choice, not a necessity. The United Nations is the place to address the drivers of forced displacement.\nOur second challenge to frame migration as a positive force. Migrants contribute to diversity and global wealth. They bring fresh skills and dynamism to their host countries. If they are integrated successfully, they enrich societies. A positive narrative on migration is not difficult to present. The facts speak for themselves, but many of us lack the ability \u2014 and often the courage \u2014 to speak truthfully about the facts. Exploiting fears in a search for short-term political gains is cynical. It is an unproductive game. We must do better than that.\nMass atrocities are one of the main drivers of displacement; one needs only to take a look at the tragic situation in Syria and the massive displacement it has caused. Preventing genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes will eliminate one of the main reasons why people are forced to flee their homes.The Security Council can enter a new phase of its history of engagement on these crimes, moving from shameful indifference to responsible action. One hundred and twelve States subscribe to the code of conduct on atrocity crimes of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group. It offers the opportunity to change the political culture in the Security Council so that failures such as the one in Syria can become a thing of the past, and so as to make a significant reduction of forced displacement a reality. It goes hand in hand with the Secretary-General\u2019s Human Rights Up Front initiative, which we warmly welcome.\nArmed conflicts also force people to flee, often in large numbers. Many conflicts can be prevented if competent diplomacy is decisive and timely. The world is looking to the Organization to mobilize, and too often it is disappointed. Getting serious about conflict prevention should be a priority for the next Secretary- General \u2014 with the necessary means provided by the Member States. But let us not forget that armed conflict is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations Charter in and of itself. For 70 years now, it has been illegal to engage in an armed conflict, except in narrowly defined circumstances. We now can also hold the most egregious perpetrators of illegal use of force responsible.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the most comprehensive blueprint for action we have ever agreed on \u2014 a pledge to our children and to all future generations. It is also an ambitious promise that we can keep only it if we work together with resolve and persistence. All 17 Goals are of equal importance and they are all connected. We will treat them as such in our implementation effort, but we will naturally also place special emphasis on the areas where we feel we can make a special contribution.\nThe rule of law, in particular, is a long-standing priority for Liechtenstein. Accountable institutions, access to justice for everyone and significant reduction of corruption \u2014 all these are key ingredients for sustainable development. Justice is credible and effective only if it is delivered in an even-handed manner. Only if it is clear that nobody is above the law can the law prevail. Ensuring accountability for the most serious crimes under international law is therefore crucial.\nFor almost 15 years now, the International Criminal Court has been the symbol of our pledge that even the most powerful are not above the law \u2014 that there will be no impunity for perpetrators of the worst crimes. We fully support the Court and are committed to helping to improve it.\nWe look forward to the extension of the Rome Statute, whereby the Court\u2019s jurisdiction will expand to include crimes of aggression and the most serious forms of the illegal use of force will be criminalized. This will be a historic step, marking the first time since the creation of the United Nations that an international tribunal will have such jurisdiction. The necessary number of States has ratified the relevant Kampala Amendments to the Rome Statute, and the activation of this ground-breaking regime is scheduled for 2017. I appeal to everyone to join the 32 States who have ratified these Amendments \u2014 and to do so soon.\nThe Court is the strongest symbol that impunity is no longer an option. At the same time, it is also not a solution to all problems. The Court\u2019s capacity to handle cases is limited, and there are still a significant number of States outside its jurisdiction. Among them are some that most warrant greater accountability, such as Syria. The crimes committed against its civilian population since 2011 are as atrocious as they are well- documented. The attack on the humanitarian convoy in Aleppo marks a new low. We understand that these atrocious crimes will be thoroughly investigated, as they should be. A peace process in a country must have a strong accountability dimension. That is the least we can provide after having failed the people of Syria for so long.\nThe 2030 Agenda also deals with one of the defining human rights crises of our times \u2014 human trafficking and modern slavery. Upon entering the United Nations from the North Lawn, one can see the monument erected to commemorate the victims of the transatlantic slave trade. That is a dignified, important reminder of a terrifying crime against humanity. But let us not be misled into believing that the scourge has been relegated to the past. Over 45 million people today live in conditions that qualify as modern slavery, which generates billions of dollars. Every single country in the world is affected by it and virtually no perpetrators are held accountable \u2014 even though slavery is outlawed universally.\nModern slavery is a complex phenomenon that affects all of us and should leave none of us indifferent. We all have a chance to make a difference as individual consumers and as policy-makers. Modern slavery is not only one of the biggest human rights scandals of our times; it is also one of the biggest illegal business models. Liechtenstein will focus its contribution on disrupting financial flows and using relevant data for criminal prosecutions \u2014 in short, on following the money. We will also work towards a greater involvement of international justice mechanisms in the cases where national judiciaries systematically fail.\nI wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We will remember him as a tireless advocate for the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We are thankful for his service.\nEffective leadership is a key ingredient for the success of the Organization. We have therefore invested a great deal in the selection process of the next Secretary-General. We have achieved a new level of transparency, which is an important step forward. But we must be honest with ourselves; we have started at such a low level that there is still a lot of room for improvement. The opportunity to engage with declared candidates is welcome. It should also be a given. We now must ensure that the entire membership is consulted with respect to the appointment itself. We strongly believe in giving the next Secretary-General a single term of office. That would enhance the independence of the Office of the Secretary-General, as prior office-holders have confirmed.\nFinally, it is my strong personal wish to finally see a woman lead the Organization \u2014 an Organization that has been such a trailblazer for gender equality. We do believe that the appointment should be merit-based. The best-qualified person available should be offered the job. I would be very happy if that person was a woman.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin my speech by conveying my deep gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to all heads of State and Government who have sent their condolences to the Uzbek people on the occasion of the untimely passing of the first President of the independent Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov. Under his leadership, Uzbekistan embarked upon the path of confident independent development and was recognized as a sovereign State and full-fledged Member of the United Nations.\nThe President of Uzbekistan spoke from this high rostrum many times. In this very Hall, he announced a number of important international political initiatives aimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia, promoting peace in Afghanistan, overcoming the consequences of the Aral Sea ecological disaster and bolstering the effectiveness of international cooperation in the struggle against international terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking. All of those proposals, put forward by the leader of Uzbekistan, were fully supported by the international community and, today, are making a tangible practical contribution to ensuring common peace, stability and sustainable development.\nIn the 25 years under Karimov\u2019s leadership, Uzbekistan became a modern and dynamically developing State. As Acting President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoev underscored at a recent session of our Parliament, in the years following its independence Uzbekistan\u2019s economy grew by a factor of six. The real income per capita rose by a factor of nine. Over the last 11 years, gross domestic product growth rates have remained above 8 per cent. According to estimates, this year\u2019s growth rates will continue the same trend. As the Secretary-General acknowledged in his congratulatory message on the occasion of Uzbekistan\u2019s twenty-fifth jubilee anniversary of independence, our country has made steady progress in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nI would now like to briefly touch upon some important issues.\nFirst of all, Uzbekistan will maintain its consistent foreign policy aimed at the protection and advancement of the country\u2019s fundamental interests. Its foreign policy is grounded in a firm commitment to the fundamental principles of international law as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as in all international legal instruments to which Uzbekistan is a signatory. As Acting President Mirziyoev has stated, Uzbekistan will continue to promote friendships and constructive cooperation with all foreign countries, on the basis of the principles of mutual respect, equality and interests.\nUzbekistan is a firm believer in not interfering in the internal affairs of other States and addressing emerging tensions and conflict only through peaceful and political means. Our country has made the principled and unambiguous choice not to join any military- political blocs or alliances, not to allow the stationing of foreign military bases on its territory and not to send our servicemen beyond the country\u2019s borders.\nSecondly, Afghanistan was and continues to be one of the main threats to international security and stability. Regrettably, we see little hope for the resolution of that country\u2019s accumulated contradictions any time soon. The settlement of the Afghan conflict will be possible only if it is based on an intra-Afghan national accord and attained through peaceful political negotiations among the major hostile groups, under the auspices of the United Nations, and, very importantly, without any preliminary conditions. This is important so that the donor countries and international institutions can commit to allocating assistance to Afghanistan aimed at real socioeconomic improvement and the raising of living standards of the population. Above all, assistance must be channelled to education and learning.\nPeace in Afghanistan will bring tangible benefits to all countries of the Eurasian continent. Sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan will stimulate the construction of motorways and railroads, the development of regional and transregional commerce and the establishment of numerous pipelines going in all directions. In that regard, the international community should start seeing Afghanistan, not as a source of regional problems, threats and challenges, but rather as a unique strategic opportunity that ends the status quo once and for all and establishes the basis for multilateral relations that will allow us to attain our goals of prosperity and well-being for all.\nThirdly, the protection and preservation of the environment has a central place in the Sustainable Development Goals for the period between 2016 and 2030, as adopted by the General Assembly last year. The tragedy of the Aral Sea is a vivid example. The significant ecological, climatic, socioeconomic and humanitarian consequences of the tragedy have been a direct threat to the sustainable development of the region and to the health, gene pool and future of the people residing there. The most important task today is to preserve the natural biological diversity of the Aral Sea region, reduce the environmental impacts of the Aral Sea tragedy, and, most importantly, preserve the many vital activities that allow millions of people in the region to survive.\nFourthly, the Republic of Uzbekistan supports the strengthening of the entire United Nations system. We must reinforce its structures\u2019 role in addressing regional and international security problems and ensuring sustainable development. For some time now, Uzbekistan has supported institutional reform at the United Nations to ensure efficiency in its work and a better functioning in the way its principal bodies \u2014 the General Assembly and Security Council \u2014 interact. Furthermore, the General Assembly must preserve its central role as a major advisory, policymaking and representative body, while the Security Council must be reformed step by step, including through its expansion.\n"

        "file_text": "I take the floor on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whom I am honoured to represent. It is a true pleasure to join previous speakers in congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to wish him and his Bureau full success in the execution of their mandate. I also address this well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, in the light of his tireless efforts that have so greatly served our Organization.\nMotivated by the desire to achieve peace, security and development in every one of our States and throughout the world, in September of last year together we adopted a new global development agenda, which we intend to inspire us for the next 15 years. It was meant to overcome the challenges of underdevelopment and poverty and create a more just world with greater solidarity and stability, where equal opportunity would no longer be only a dream.\nThe theme for this general debate, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, is an inarguable opportunity. It allows for a first overall assessment of the focus of the new agenda so that, if necessary, we can adjust the path forward in order to guarantee the full achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Taking into consideration lessons learned from the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, the Democratic Republic of the Congo chose to integrate the SDGs into our national strategic development plan. It is based on a long-term view and a strategic framework to ensure that our policies and actions align with the issues of climate change as well as the priorities of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, which has committed us to a process aimed at raising the Democratic Republic of the Congo into the middle-income-country category by 2021, the emerging-country category by 2030 and the developed-country category by 2050.\nThe implementation of this plan will take the form of five-year plans, the first of which covers the period from 2017 to 2021. In this first five-year plan, priority will again be given to the improvement of human capital, by taking on the problem of the demographic dividends that require strict collaboration among various stakeholders in development at both the national and international levels, with a view to ensuring strong, sustained and, above all, inclusive, economic growth. Particular attention is therefore paid to the specific needs of youths and women in terms of education, job training, improvement of their scientific and technological knowledge, health and employment. Actions stemming from this option are designed to jointly implement a programme for building the transportation infrastructure needed to bring agricultural and mining products to market and stimulate the mobility of persons and goods.\nBeyond that, there are many challenges, including that of strengthening the national statistical system and the population and housing census, with a view to having reliable updated data for designing, monitoring and evaluating development programmes. In the case of my country, these efforts are naturally linked to the mobilization of funds, in particular by easing the conditions for donors and diversifying financial resources.\nWith regard to the political situation, my country has entered into a crucial phase of administrative decentralization in order to enable local management. Each of the 26 new provinces of my country currently have authorities that the population has freely chosen, following the elections for provincial governors and deputy governors of the province, which took place in March and April. This new democratic experience will continue when future elections are organized for local authorities in both urban and rural areas, to take place concurrently with the presidential, legislative, national and provincial elections. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has made an irreversible choice in ensuring that access to State power is possible only through the elections.\nI would also like to most solemnly reaffirm that, despite delays in registration and preparations, the general elections initially slated for the end of this year will be organized by the Independent National Electoral Commission, which has, under the Constitution, exclusive jurisdiction over them. The elections will take place as planned, that is, as soon as technical conditions permit. Many other challenges need to be overcome in order to allow the organization of free, transparent, credible and peaceful elections. In order to come together and meet these challenges in a consensual manner, the presidential majority, the political opposition and civil society came together over a two-week period in order to engage in an inclusive national political dialogue facilitated by the African Union with the assistance of an international support group.\nThe right to elect and be elected is a fundamental right both for Congolese citizens who live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and for those who live abroad. The major challenge today in exercising that right is to ensure that we have inclusive and reliable voting registers. In that regard, I would like to welcome the importance of the voter registration process that began on 31 July, which gives the possibility for people to run for office and to vote. It has included more than 14 million Congolese, those who live in the country or abroad, representing one third of the electoral core, who could not have enjoyed this right without those reforms.\nThe current political national dialogue in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the process of peaceful resolution of disputes among Congolese with a view to organizing the elections and consolidating our democracy should benefit from everyone\u2019s support, in particular of political actors who are not yet participating in the process, but who are encouraged to do so. On the other hand, any recourse to the use of violence should be strongly condemned and the perpetrators punished, and any invitation to any insurrection or other unconstitutional mode of access to power should be denounced.\nThe promotion of human rights has made progress in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a post- conflict State that has had to face numerous challenges. Two months ago, we hosted a visit from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the context of cooperation with his Office and the Human Rights Council. We are planning to pursue and deepen reforms in this area. That has certainly been the case with respect to the protection of women\u2019s rights. Two important laws have been recently enacted \u2014 one on gender equality and one on changing the outdated provisions of the family code, in order to align the law with international law in force. With regard to violence against women, we have seen reliable indicators that have shown a net reduction of 50 per cent in cases of sexual violence from 2014 to 2015.\nWith specific regard to the right to health care, significant progress has been achieved in fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. However, we need to remain vigilant with regard to certain cross-border diseases that had been eradicated in the past, namely, yellow fever and cholera, of which we have recently seen some signs of resurgence.\nThe mandate of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) was extended to 31 March 2017, pursuant to resolution 2277 (2016), in order to support the laudable efforts that the Forces arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo have been deploying to root out the armed groups that are still resistant to peace. While welcoming the assistance, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo notes that thanks to the security sector reform currently under way, the national defence and security forces have shown greater efficiency and competence in the execution of their mission to protect the national territory and provide security for goods and persons. They are therefore relying on the strategic dialogue with the United Nations to achieve a progressive reduction of MONUSCO personnel and a subsequent transformation of the Mission.\nHaving informed the Assembly about the situation in my country, I would now like to express the vision of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on several major issues of concern in the world today.\nThroughout its existence, the United Nations has made numerous important achievements and attained success in the areas of peace, security, international cooperation, human rights and socioeconomic development. In spite of these results, international peace remains an ongoing quest. In addition, as it operates in a world that is constantly changing and evolving, the United Nations is called upon to exercise its specific mandate to constantly question itself and adapt in order to better confront the new challenges and threats that the world is facing.\nThat is why reform of our international Organization and its methods and modes of operation is necessary. In that regard, we need to look into broadening the membership of the permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council. The Democratic Republic of the Congo attaches importance to that reform, which, in order to be viable, must take the political and numerical weight of Africa in the General Assembly into account and allow that continent to fully take part in decisions that concern it, especially since two thirds of the situations reviewed in the Security Council concern Africa. To that end, the Ezulwini Consensus remains the only acceptable basis for negotiation. In the same context, it is important to also strengthen the decision-making power of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to promote peace, social justice, democracy and development.\nThe international commercial and financial architecture must also undergo profound transformations so that it can adapt to developments and changes on the international scene and so that the United Nations can be a source of hope for all. Moreover, our Organization should promote greater transparency and democracy, particularly in selecting the next Secretary-General, while preserving the rules and practices that have proved to be effective, in particular the regional rotation scheme.\nThe fight for peace is also a fight against terrorism. That scourge of our century must remain one of the priorities of our Organization. For my country, terrorism is now the most serious threat to international peace and security. The despicable and indiscriminate acts that characterize that phenomenon demand international solidarity and continuous dialogue in order to better organize our response. The peoples living in the eastern part of my country, particularly in the region of Beni, have on more than one occasion become the innocent victims of terrorist violence. That is why we reiterate here our support for the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, as well as our firm condemnation of the scourge of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nOur planet is confronting an unprecedented environmental challenge in the form of climate change, which has a direct negative impact on the quality of our lives and which mortgages the very future of humankind. That is why, after having actively participated in the negotiations and the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, through the intervention of its Head of State, signed the Agreement on 22 April here in New York. Now we are finalizing the ratification process, which should be completed before the end of this year.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes another major advancement with regard to international governance, that is, the adoption of the final document\nof the recent high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, namely, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex). It is high time to put an end to the thousands of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean and address the root causes of those displacements, which are mainly poverty, armed conflicts and the lack of resilience to disasters. We must make sure that we resolve those problems so that all citizens of the world, and in particular those in developing countries, can live happily and peacefully in their own countries. That is the very basic principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, that is, to leave no one behind.\nI have focused my comments today on the launch by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals from the beginning of 2016 by determining priority actions, while noting the links between its goals and my country\u2019s new strategic development plan. I have also given a general overview of the political, electoral and human rights situation in my country, while mentioning the partnership between my Government and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nIn so doing, I called for United Nations reform through the enlargement of the Security Council and the strengthening of the mandate of the General Assembly. I stressed that there is a need for international solidarity and ongoing consultations in order to better organize our common response to the fight against terrorism. I also recalled the huge importance of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and welcomed the adoption of the New York Declaration, which provides us with the strategy for managing the large-scale displacements of refugees and migrants, by noting the need to tackle the root causes of those evils.\nI will conclude my remarks by once again reiterating our faith in multilateralism and expressing the hope to see everyone uphold and promote its principles and values in the interest of international peace and for the good of humankind. I would like to salute and pay tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate as Secretary-General of our Organization is coming to an end. We would like to thank him for his significant contributions to the preservation of the principles and values of our Organization and for his decisive contribution to re-establishing peace and stability in my country.\n\u2003\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government of San Marino, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at the seventy-first session. We wish him a fruitful session, and the San Marino delegation assures the President of its full cooperation throughout the work of the General Assembly. I would also like to express my country\u2019s gratitude to the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the work he did during the seventieth session.\nAt the end of the last year of his second term as Secretary-General, my country extends its special thanks to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon for the energy and determination with which he has led the United Nations, and for the sensitivity he has shown towards all Member States without distinction.\nThe theme chosen for this session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, offers an interesting opportunity to make a constructive contribution to the work of the Assembly. The United Nations today faces challenges whose level of complexity and degree of interrelatedness are unparalleled in its history. The Organization must adapt quickly to new global challenges but also to the new opportunities offered by globalization in order to be more effective in carrying out its mandate. At the same time, the very complexity of these global challenges, which cannot be solved by any single State alone, unequivocally reaffirms the value and central role of the United Nations as a forum for solving global problems. In this context, the determination shown by the Secretary-General in submitting a proposal to the Organization for adaptation and requesting similar adaptation from Member States must be highlighted. This is why many of the initiatives undertaken have yielded significant results during his mandate.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015 in the presence of many Heads of State and Government including Their Excellencies the Captains Regent of the Republic of San Marino was one of the most important moments in the history of the United Nations. This ambitious Agenda integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development \u2014 economic, social and environmental. As an expression of a strong political consensus on the approach to sustainable global and innovative development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development defines our future and the vision of the world we want to live in. The transformation process for a new model of sustainable development is now under way.\nOur country appreciates the commitment shown by Member States to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. Our country also attaches great importance to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and to the monitoring mechanism identified in the High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The real challenge today lies in the firmness of our will to effectively implement this vision. This is the response that the peoples we represent in this forum expect from us: that our Organization fulfil its mandate of protecting the citizens of the world and that Member States resume their responsibilities without letting national interests prevail over the ideals of solidarity and respect for the universal rights of every human being. Any hesitation in doing so will inevitably exact a very heavy toll in terms of destruction and loss of human lives.\nOver the past few years, we have unfortunately witnessed a series of events that constitute a very serious threat to international peace and security and therefore are an obstacle to the complete fulfilment of our mandate. We are facing the persistence of wars that have caused an unprecedented global humanitarian crisis, an increase in terrorism and violent extremism, the tragedy of the large movements of migrants and refugees, and a rise in populism and intolerance.\nThe conflict in Syria, which has continued uninterrupted since March 2011, has already caused more than 270,000 deaths, of which over 13,000 are children and more than 8,000 women. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been wounded. Inevitably, the humanitarian situation in Syria has drastically deteriorated. Most of those who need primary care, in particular women and children, live in besieged areas that cannot be reached by humanitarian convoys.\nIn five years, the Syrian conflict has caused 4.8 million people to become refugees in neighbouring countries \u2014 hundreds of thousands in Europe \u2014 and 6.6 million displaced people inside Syria itself, out of a population of over 20 million people before the war. More than 130 million people worldwide need humanitarian assistance as a result of armed conflicts and natural disasters. In Syria, for example, more than 13 million people need humanitarian assistance because of the war. In Yemen, there are more than 20 million who require assistance.\nThe Republic of San Marino has always strongly condemned all violations of human rights and international humanitarian laws perpetrated in Syria by all parties to the conflict, without any distinction. These are violations that are unfortunately still occurring today as we gather to affirm our commitment to peace and security. San Marino supports the action of the Secretary-General in Syria through his Special Envoy and expresses its appreciation for the work carried out there.\nSan Marino is well aware of the extreme seriousness of the world situation and of the need for each international stakeholder to play its part. In recent months it has contributed concretely to addressing the present humanitarian emergency. Besides contributing financially to various international programmes, San Marino has joined the Humanitarian Corridors project promoted by the Community of Sant\u2019Egidio, the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy and the Waldensian Table, supported by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has hosted some migrants in the Republic of San Marino \u2014 a small contribution from a micro-State with great determination.\nIt is therefore necessary to have a united approach that combines the long-term perspective embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a short-term focus that makes it possible for us to address the emergencies that are evident to all. This united approach can only result from a significant cultural change based on the awareness of belonging to one human family and recognizing, as a consequence, the culture of understanding and of peaceful coexistence among different peoples and cultures as the only way to face the challenges of globalization without excluding anyone. Indeed, working together is the only way to build a planet for all.\nWith a view to fulfilling that mandate, we wish to express our heartfelt thanks to the Secretary-General for having placed the protection and promotion of human rights at the core of his agenda. Today, we can say that this is a cross-cutting issue and that human rights are reflected in every action of the United Nations aimed at achieving peace, security, justice and sustainable development. Only once we fully recognize and share the sense of the inalienable value of the person, in whatever condition or stage of life, will the cultural and religious differences and the many traditions within our Organization be seen not as obstacles to possible solutions but rather as valuable resources that make it possible to harmonize the diverse interests of the international community. In this regard, promoting full respect for individuals is not just one of the many goals but, on the contrary, the foundation upon which all our actions must be based in order to eliminate poverty, share prosperity, offer decent work to all and, ultimately, protect our planet.\nThe work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies contributes to affirming the culture of respect for fundamental rights, mutual knowledge and understanding, tolerance and hospitality. This is the culture that we, the States Members of the United Nations, must strive to disseminate among our citizens, starting with our young people, because it is only by affirming those values that the objectives set out by our Organization will be achieved.\nThe Republic of San Marino, in accordance with its history and tradition of freedom and democracy, firmly believes in that mandate and will support any action that helps strengthen the United Nations as it strives to fulfil it.\n"

        "file_text": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud whenever a member of our small island developing States assumes the presidency of the General Assembly. As we thank the outgoing President for his noble efforts, we place special trust in the new President to lead our Assembly at this crucial juncture. From our Atlantic archipelago to his Pacific one, we pledge our cooperation and solidarity as he discharges his important mission.\nWith each passing year, the Assembly has heard more and more voices with greater and greater intensity chronicling the shortcomings, as well as the possibilities, of our modern global order. As that crescendo of collective wisdom has grown evermore powerful, it has become increasingly apparent that the inbuilt inequalities of our global architecture are threatening the very foundations of this 71-year-old international experiment \u2014 inequalities of access and opportunity, unequal distribution of global burdens and benefits, a system of double standards untethered from principle, a calcification of the very divisions that globalization was meant to obliterate.\nHowever, even as the voices have grown more powerful, the inequalities they decry have remained stubbornly intractable. The voices from the periphery, no matter how loud or plentiful, appear unable to rouse the core beneficiaries of a flawed system from their affluent apathy. No matter how many global crises have been and are plainly rooted in global inequalities, powerful short-term self-interest has prevailed in the face of collective common sense.\nThe year 2016 has seen the ripening of the fruit of that short-sighted approach. The pressure for change now comes not only from the marginalized outposts of globalization\u2019s casualties, but internally, from within the rich and powerful nations themselves. The globalization\u2019s discontents and its discontented have reached critical mass within the citadels of casino capitalism and consumption. That discontent has been transmitted with crystal clarity by way of the ballot boxes from Montana to the British Midlands, where the cool logic of the status quo was trumped by emotional appeals for a return, however undesirable, to past glories imagined or real. The crescendo of voices is now borderless and cross-cutting. It is impossible to ignore any longer.\nThe threadbare clich\u00e9s of globalization\u2019s presumed benefits are of cold comfort to marginalized nations and peoples. The latter have fasted too long at the dry spigot of promised trickle-down prosperity. The longed-for rising tide that lifts all boats has come in the form of rising seas that threaten to inundate small island developing States and a tsunami of corporate consolidations that has had a deleterious effect on small States, small businesses, small farmers and the poor. This year, we must address the chasm between our idealistic expectations and our deeply flawed realities. Modern globalization as a concept, as a rules-and- norms-based system and as an international practice is unbalanced and unsustainable. It is a system that is broken, one that is not beyond repair, but in urgent need of reform. Globalization benefits few and is an onerous burden on too many. To use a cricketing metaphor, we must take a fresh guard.\nIt is that urgent need for a fresh and transformative approach that adds impetus and a sense of immediacy to the President\u2019s theme for this year\u2019s general debate, which calls for a universal push to transform our world. In order to achieve that transformation, the President has recognized the potential of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in doing so has correctly identified our existing difficulties as being rooted in the inequities that the SDGs seek to address. Our collective quest to achieve those Goals is indistinguishable from the overarching pursuit of a fairer, more just and more equal world. We must accept the President\u2019s invitation to rethink and redesign our global compact, not in the narrow interests of modern-day robber barons, but with people-centred programmes and policies in mind.\nIn Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my Government has comprehensively incorporated the 2030 Agenda into its planning. It has focused on economic development and job creation, quality education, poverty eradication, the strengthening of institutions and infrastructure, renewable energy, climate resilience and the health, well-being and security of citizens. These are all central to our national medium-term development plans.\nThis year, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines launched a zero-hunger trust fund, inspired by Goals 1 and 2 of the SDGs. The zero-hunger trust fund employs a narrowly targeted and multifaceted set of tools that are designed to ensure that, by 2020, no citizen goes hungry. We hope that the fund will be generously supported by our developmental partners and that it will become a best practice that can be adopted and adapted in other small island contexts.\nGoal 7 of the SDGs calls for the development of renewable energy with particular emphasis on small island States. In our quest for affordable and clean energy, our country has heavily invested in developing its geothermal resources. We anticipate that by 2019, 50 per cent of our national energy will be geothermal and 80 per cent of our energy will come from a mixture of renewable resources, including hydroelectric and solar energy. We are indebted to the Clinton Global Initiative, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the Caribbean Development Bank, and the International Renewable Energy Agency, to name but a few, for their invaluable support of the initiative.\nAs major greenhouse-gas emitters continue to dither, more frequent and more intense hurricanes continue to sweep our lands and to wash away large portions of our gross domestic product. We are already experiencing the terrible effects of climate change. The spotlight on mitigation should now also be shone on adaptation, which is a more immediate concern. The trajectory we face is one of rising temperatures and the mitigation pledges made by countries ahead of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 put us on track for a 3-3.5\u00b0C increase in global temperatures by the end of the century. I applaud the international community for reaching the much-anticipated Paris Agreement on Climate Change in December last year, as well as the Secretary-General for convening the high-level event on entry into force of Paris Agreement during the current seventy-first session.\nHowever, the promises made in the Paris Agreement to mitigate climate change and to provide climate financial aid are inadequate and unenforceable. Indeed, as President Obama of the United States noted in his final address to this Organization, the Paris Agreement is just a framework; therefore, we need to be more ambitious. The failure to mobilize sufficiently and facilitate access to promised climate financial aid mirrors official development aid scenarios, where the majority of developed countries have failed to meet the 0.7 per cent target of gross national income that was agreed to in the Monterrey Consensus in 2002. Accessing the promised financial aid has been extremely difficult.\nFor globalization to be legitimately transformed, it must be fully inclusive. That inclusivity must be based on the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference embodied in the letter and the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and on an end to the cynical enabling of major Powers\u2019 interests at the expense of people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. Nowhere is that cynicism and feigned impotence more apparent than in the civil war that has devastated the Syrian Arab Republic over the past five years. The Assembly and the Security Council have too frequently turned a blind eye and stayed silent when faced with the actions of countries that have sought to fund and foment war and instability in Syria. Creative diplomacy, not military victory, is clearly the answer for putting an end to this conflict.\nThe impotence of learned helplessness and the tyranny of failure to intervene has meant that many nations have been repeatedly and unjustly excluded from the promise of an integrated world. The people of the State of Palestine are victims of that impotence, despite the overwhelming recognition of Palestine and the obvious need for an independent and internationally supported contiguous State, where the population is able to live in peace alongside its Israeli neighbours.\nThe people-centred and progressive leaders of Latin America and the Caribbean, who dared to dream of alternatives to an iniquitous status quo, are once again being punished for their impertinence \u2014 from the continued embargo against the noble Cuban people and the externally stoked unrest in Venezuela, to the parliamentary coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Brazil. We are entering a new but depressingly familiar chapter in a book that is already soaked with the blood of progressive heroes. However, the schemes of yesteryear, with their dirty tricks and divisions, will fail when faced with the new solidarity that has taken root across our region. Our States, as part of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas as well as the signatories to the Petrocaribe Energy Cooperation Agreement, understand the unshakeable strength that comes from unity and the courage of our collective convictions.\nThis year marks the inauguration of a new, democratically elected President of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reaffirms our continued solidarity with the aspirations of the Taiwanese Government and people, just as they have stood with us throughout our post-independence development journey. We decry the myopia of a body that pretends 24 million people do not exist and that has forced people to choose between two magnificent exemplars of the noble Chinese civilization. Such behaviour marginalizes a vibrant population and creates space for parasitic opportunists to prostitute principle for personal gain. We must recognize Taiwan\u2019s exemplary global leadership and citizenship and its commitment to development worldwide. It is high time that the Republic of China on Taiwan be allowed to participate meaningfully in all of the specialized bodies and programmes of the United Nations system. There is absolutely no compelling argument to the contrary.\nI have spoken in the past of the shameful failure on the part of the United Nations to acknowledge its indisputable role in the spread of cholera in Haiti. The catastrophe has now killed over 10,000 Haitians and infected almost 800,000 others. The outbreak shows no sign of abating. Last month, the United Nations belatedly acknowledged its culpability while continuing to use claims of immunity to deny the victims of such a tragedy their fundamental right to be made whole. The cholera epidemic and the failure of the United Nations to address or arrest it has laid bare a shameful ethical bankruptcy and institutional cowardice through legal subterfuge. The report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Mr. Philip Alston, has called the response of the United Nations to the cholera epidemic, \u201cmorally unconscionable, legally indefensible and politically self-defeating\u201d (A/71/367, p. 2). We agree.\nIn Haiti\u2019s neighbour, the Dominican Republic, the human rights crisis affecting tens of thousands of Dominican-born citizens of Haitian descent remains unresolved. As the Caribbean community and other actors have sought to persuade the Dominican authorities to respect the rights of its citizens against statelessness and State-sponsored ethnic and racial victimization, indifference on the part of the United Nations is wholly unacceptable.\nThe Caribbean communities\u2019 determined quest for reparatory justice for victims of the transatlantic slave trade \u2014 a native genocide \u2014 continues to gather momentum. Historians, economists and other academics, human rights lawyers and social activists across the world have coalesced into a formidable advocacy and educational force around our cause. Our citizens continue to be enthusiastically engaged in the process of discussion and awareness. We call upon the European nations that created and profited immeasurably from the indefensible trade of human beings to join us in the conversation about the contours of a just and appropriate response to such a monumental tragedy and its consequential legacy of underdevelopment.\nThe uneven prolonged aftermath of the 2008 global economic and financial crisis highlights the need for reform in all the major global institutions. We are having difficulties across the world with heavy- handed financial regulations that hamper legitimate transactions and the corresponding banking relations.\nAs I conclude, I stress that the dream of equitable development cannot be deferred any longer. Let us imagine a better world, a fairer world, a peaceful world, a world with a safe and sustainable future \u2014 and let us work towards that world, unburdened by the errors of the past or constrained by the shackles of a learned helplessness, but confident, optimistic and clear- sighted about the boundless possibilities of genuine international cooperation. The universal push to transform our world is urgent and necessary. We know and feel that fundamental truth. It is time for focused and meaningful action. Let us get on with it.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin my congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also extend our deep appreciation to your immediate predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his able stewardship of the seventieth session of the Assembly.\nWe all vividly recall the momentous occasion in September last year when we adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This session of the General Assembly provides us with a unique opportunity to review the measures we have taken so far, at both the international and national levels, in line with our commitments to global socioeconomic transformation. We hope that this time around this Agenda will meet a better fate.\nWe are encouraged that since September last year, foundational steps have been and are being taken at various levels to implement the 2030 Agenda. In this regard, we note the convening of the Global Infrastructure Forum in April 2016, the convening of the Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology\nand Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals in June, and the launch of the Technology Facilitation Mechanism together with the activation of its online platform. We also note the follow-up meetings pertaining to the development of concrete actions for the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development. These activities at the global level have been equally matched at the national level, with virtually all Member States reporting making preparations for the implementation of this universal Agenda.\nFor our part, I am happy to report that we have established national and multi-stakeholder and multisectoral structures to assimilate and implement the 2030 Agenda. We have done that in a coordinated and integrated manner, with our national development programme, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation. Our task of assimilating the 2030 Agenda has been made relatively less challenging, in that the vision and aspirations of our national economic blueprint and the global agenda are basically the same. Our biggest impediment to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda is the burden of punitive and heinous sanctions imposed against us by some hegemonic and neo-imperialist Powers among us here.\nMy country, Zimbabwe, is the innocent victim of the spiteful sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western Powers. These countries have maintained the sanctions on us for some 16 years now. As a country, we are being collectively punished for exercising the one primordial principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter, that of sovereign independence. We are being punished for doing what all other nations have done and still do, namely, possess and own their natural resources and attend to the basic interests of their people. Those who have imposed these sanctions would rather have us pander to their interests at the expense of the basic needs of the majority of our people. As long as these economic and financial sanctions remain in place, Zimbabwe\u2019s capacity to fully and effectively implement the 2030 Agenda will be deeply curtailed. I repeat my call on the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States and their allies to lift the illegal and unjustified sanctions against my country and its people. Let us all be bound by our commitments to the 2030 Agenda, in which we agreed to eschew sanctions in favour of dialogue.\nThe General Assembly will elect the next Secretary- General of our Organization at the current session. We have witnessed commendable efforts aimed at making the selection process of the next Secretary-General inclusive and transparent. The greater involvement of the General Assembly and therefore of the majority of our membership does not, however, mask the opaqueness of the process at the Security Council level. We expect the current experience to lead to a more inclusive and transparent process in the future.\nFor over 20 years, many of us have come to this rostrum, demanding and pleading for the reform of the Security Council. We are no closer to achieving that goal today than we were 20 years ago. This is so, in spite of the universal acknowledgement of the injustice, unfairness and inappropriateness of the current composition of the Council. We now have an opportunity in the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations to redress this unjust and unjustifiable situation in the interest of a strong and more united Organization capable of delivering on its mandate.\nOur common commitment to leaving no one behind demands that we address the plight of people still living under colonialism and occupation. The people of Palestine have lived under occupation and persecution for over 49 years. It is high time that the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, fulfilled its Charter duties and obligations by implementing its resolutions, which include General Assembly resolution 181 (II) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The two-State solution, based on the pre-June 1967 borders, should now be pursued within those parameters and timelines. This is the only way to achieve durable peace in the Middle East.\nOn our own continent, the United Nations is duty- bound by Charter principle to redouble its efforts to ensure the full realization of the right of self- determination of the people of Western Sahara. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that sustainable development cannot be achieved without the full realization of the right of the peoples living under colonial and foreign occupation. We urge the holding of the independence referendum for the Sahrawi people without much further delay.\nI would like to conclude by thanking the Secretary- General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the tremendous work he has done during his tenure. We have appreciated his presence at African Union summits and his visits to Africa as a clear testimony to his commitment to and partnership with Africa in advancing the cause of freedom, development and peace \u2014 and the security of our continent. We particularly applaud the Secretary- General\u2019s leadership in mobilizing the entire United Nations system and indeed the international community to partner with Africa in stopping and rolling back the Ebola epidemic, which claimed thousands of lives and undermined Africa\u2019s socioeconomic development. He has indeed been an indefatigable advocate for self- determination and a persistent champion of inclusive development, peace and coalition-building for dealing with humanitarian and other crises. We wish him well in all his future endeavours, and I am sure that many of us will miss him, especially we of Africa.\n"

I would also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the Assembly at its seventieth session, for his effective work.\nThe current state of global realities and the nature and direction of their political, economic and social processes require Governments and major international organizations to cooperate ever more closely and with greater coordination if they are to achieve their principal shared goal of ensuring international peace\nand security and preserving the legal and institutional pillars that form the foundation of today\u2019s world order. The effectiveness of that cooperation, and our ability to strike a reasonable balance between national interests and those of the international community as a whole, will also determine to a large degree our success in solving other no less important global problems in the areas of the environment, energy, food security and in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and other challenges.\nUnfortunately, we are currently witnessing complex processes that are undermining global cooperation in those areas, foremost among them the ever-expanding area of the world with potential for conflict and the spread of breeding grounds for tension. Conflicts are escalating in various parts of the globe, and the parties involved in them increasingly resort to the use of force and military means. We are seeing brazen disregard and at times outright contempt for the rules of international law.\nIn view of the situation, Turkmenistan calls on Member States to evaluate such manifestations clearly and unambiguously and to join in supporting strict and scrupulous adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the foundational international conventions, accords and agreements designed to resolve conflicts. We urge Member States to launch broad-based consultations with a view to identifying uniform conceptual approaches to de-escalating conflict based on international legal standards and under the leadership of the United Nations as a universal mechanism for settling disputes. We think it would be advisable to convene a special meeting of the General Assembly, within the framework of the seventy-first session, devoted to strengthening the role of international law in the maintenance of global peace and security.\nThe role of the peacebuilding tools at the international community\u2019s disposal is growing, particularly the potential of the notion of neutrality and its conceptual foundations as a basis for strengthening general stability and security. That received special emphasis at the high-level international conference held in Ashgabat in December 2015 to mark the twentieth anniversary of Turkmenistan\u2019s neutral status. We take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the Member States and international organizations that participated in the forum and contributed to its success. The conference\u2019s final document reflects a willingness within the United Nations to consider Turkmenistan\u2019s proposal for proclaiming an international day of neutrality. Our country has prepared a draft resolution for the General Assembly on the subject, and we urge the States Members of the United Nations to launch a discussion of the text during this session.\nThe civilized world is facing a threat that transcends national borders and political and ideological doctrines. Terrorism falls outside human morality and threatens to undermine the entire world order and its principles, values and foundations. It is precisely for that reason that the fight against it must be conducted simultaneously at the global, regional and national levels, taking into account the specific circumstances and political and social realities of each.\nFor the States of our region, it is crucial that we ensure effective, coordinated action through the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia. The work in that area has recently been significantly intensified and multilateral cooperation in various fields has been strengthened. Major international forums on the issue, organized on Turkmenistan\u2019s initiative, have helped to give our joint efforts an essential, clearly defined and substantive regional context. The major documents adopted on the issue in 2011, the Ashgabat Declaration and Action Plan on countering terrorism in Central Asia, will serve as its road map. We believe that they contribute to multilateral efforts aimed at combating the terrorist threat, and their practical implementation will go a long way towards ensuring our shared success in this work. We look forward to more active international cooperation, including that of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia.\nExactly a year ago today, within these very walls, the World Summit adopted the long-term 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These are our common responsibility, our common objectives. In that context, I would like to specifically stress the need for the implementation of the SDGs in the national plans and programmes of all States Members of the United Nations. Turkmenistan will responsibly and constructively continue to address those issues. Turkmenistan, jointly with the United Nations Development Programme and other United Nations agencies, has developed appropriate indicators for the elaboration of its national programmes. Just a few days ago, those indicators were officially adopted by the Government of Turkmenistan.\nOne of the main focuses of the General Assembly at its current session is the desire for Member States to continue the wide-ranging dialogue on climate change as the most important element of the United Nations comprehensive strategy for the achievement of the SDGs. In our view, national and international instruments are the most important tools for meeting the SDGs. It is appropriate to recall that Turkmenistan\u2019s President, speaking at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, said that progress could not be selective and that development would not be truly sustainable and long-lasting unless it were comprehensive and the undeniable right and heritage of all nations, States, regions and continents, without exception.\nTurkmenistan fully embodies that tenet in its main approach to the global environmental agenda. Our country has begun to implement its national development plans, which are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, with a true sense of responsibility. At the legislative level, we have adopted the national climate change strategy, which provides for a gradual transition to environmental safety standards in all major spheres of industrial activity. The strategy envisages the priority development of high-technology industries and the creation of conditions for the development of the green economy as a fundamental element for the functioning of our entire infrastructure.\nTomorrow, Turkmenistan will sign the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We regard that step as a landmark in the overall implementation of environmental tasks and goals. In that connection, we believe that it is high time to fulfil the core of the Paris Agreement by intensifying United Nations efforts aimed at developing new international rules linked to climate change and environmental protection.\nAt the same time, we need to begin preparing specific regional plans for the near and medium term. We suggest the convening next year, under the auspices of the United Nations, of a special conference dedicated to ways of improving the environmental situation in Central Asia. This year, Turkmenistan will assume the chairmanship of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. Very shortly, we will begin broad consultations with the States of the region and United Nations specialized entities with a view to developing overall policy and specific arrangements for our joint work during the upcoming period. In Central Asia, we have major reasons to focus on water resources \u2014 how they impact regional development, the overall environment and social and economic problem, and what role they play in resolving serious environmental issues. Given the conditions, it has become extremely important for the States of the region to design a unified strategy on the issue of the use and preservation of water resources.\nOur country accords top priority to cooperation with the United Nations. In that regard, we believe it is advisable to step up the efforts aimed at implementing the decisions reached at the seventh World Water Forum, held in 2015 in Daegu, Republic of Korea. We view international cooperation in fighting desertification and soil degradation as important areas of work. In 2014, Turkmenistan hosted an international conference on desertification and soil degradation in Central Asia, which was organized jointly by the Government and the United Nations. Delegations from many States took part in the conference, together with international organizations. The outcome document of the conference defines the areas of future work on those issues, which we believe deserve the most scrupulous attention and evaluation at the level of the United Nations.\nToday, an effective model for international cooperation is urgently required to reduce the risks of natural disasters. Turkmenistan firmly believes that efforts aimed at reducing the risk of disasters should be automatically incorporated into future programmes and plans for sustainable development and should be implemented with close cooperation at the bilateral, regional and international levels. We call upon Member States to intensify their efforts in that area, on the basis of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was adopted last year at the Sendai Conference.\nToday, as a result of various circumstances, we are facing acute problems because of the number of migrants, refugees and stateless people. It is apparent that there are no magic formulas for solving these problems. Nevertheless, in our view, it is high time to devise targeted international cooperation initiatives, tailored to each specific situation. A key role in that regard should be played by specialized entities of the United Nations, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and by the International Migration Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other organizations. We stand ready to assist them to the utmost. Our country has had positive experiences in that area. In 2012, jointly with the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, we hosted an international ministerial conference on refugees in the Muslim world. In June 2014, the Government of Turkmenistan, jointly with the International Migration Organization and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, organized the International Conference on Migration and Statelessness: Identifying Challenges and the Way Forward, which was held in Ashgabat.\nWe call upon all Member States to step up efforts aimed at implementing the main provisions of the outcome documents of those international forums. We also reaffirm our desire and readiness to continue to work closely with the United Nations, Member States and all interested parties in solving this pressing problem of our times.\nThe comprehensive achievement of the SDGs must be viewed as the main pillar of the Organization\u2019s global strategy, which not only has political, social and economic components but is also a moral framework for the modern world order. A great deal has already been achieved. In that connection, we note the role of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose determination, political will and persistence have enabled us to achieve some results.\nNotwithstanding the diversity of tasks facing each individual country, we are brought together by our common hopes, concerns and threats. Turkmenistan stands ready to search together with its partners for new approaches and ways to overcome the challenges facing humankind. We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to cooperate with the United Nations, our active involvement in, and support for, its political and diplomatic efforts aimed at preserving and strengthening the existing architecture of global security and implementing its plans and programmes in the economic, social, environmental, humanitarian and other areas. Turkmenistan regards its partnership with the United Nations as a strategic foundation for all its work in the international arena.\n"

        "file_text": "May I first of all congratulate Mr. Thompson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I wish also to take this opportunity to thank his predecessor, whose outstanding work enabled us to modernize and render more transparent an entire series of processes, including that leading to the selection of future Secretaries-General of our Organization.\nI also wish to commend the exemplary commitment of our Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, as his mandate and his decade of service to our Organization draws to a close. He has rightly stated, as fact and as an imperative, that we are the first generation that can put an end to poverty, and we are the last generation that can act so as to avoid the repercussions of unbridled climate change.\nA year ago virtually to this day, we adopted, in this very Hall, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Today we must implement this ambitious universal programme and maintain the 2015 momentum. I therefore welcome the selection of the theme \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d for this session of the Assembly. We must work to ensure that no one is left behind and that we can all can reap the benefits of sustainable, just and equitable development. The year 2015 was also marked by the adoption of the Paris Agreement, which Luxembourg strongly committed to during its presidency of the Council of the European Union.\nThe time has come to implement these international agreements and to ensure that the commitments that we have made internationally and nationally bear fruit. We must chart a course to a sustainable future for coming generations.\nLuxembourg is actively working to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and will be among those States ratifying the Paris Agreement at the end of the year. We must act in an inclusive manner, involving the various stakeholders and ensuring that our policies are consistent, particularly in the area of development, so that we can strike a balance between the economic, environmental and social pillars.\nWe must invest in education and health care. We must fight social inequality, ensure decent work for all and provide robust social protection systems.\nMy country is among the seven countries that spend at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official development assistance; this has been the case since 2000. Official development assistance has an important rol\u0435 to play, but we must also mobilize other sources of funding. Faced with the relative decline in financial resources for development and humanitarian action, it is more urgent than ever to broaden the donor base.\nThe first World Humanitarian Summit, in which I had the honour to take part last May in Istanbul, made it possible to reassert the principles governing humanitarian action: humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. As a signatory to the grand bargain, Luxembourg will seek to increase the predictability and effectiveness of its humanitarian contributions through multi-year agreements. We also intend to strengthen aid by allocating 5 per cent of funding directly to local organizations by 2020.\nSharing, giving and helping are not words we hear much among many of my constituents these days. But are we aware of how fortunate we are? While in our country some parents must decide only if the dinner they will serve their children will be hot or cold, in other countries the question is, when will I be able to give my children some food?\nThe high-level meeting held earlier this week reminded us that the challenge posed by mass movements of refugees and migrants in recent months and years can be addressed only globally. In the second half of 2015, my country held the presidency of the Council of European Union. Migration was, unfortunately, at the centre of our concerns during the presidency. Personally, I have learned a few lessons from that experience. On the European level, solidarity and burden-sharing are also indispensable to a credible migration policy that includes border controls or respects the Dublin Regulation.\nIt is necessary to clearly distinguish between refugees in need of protection and irregular economic migrants. Most of the refugees in need of international protection have had to flee situations of war, sometimes, as in the case of Syria, through mass exoduses. The role of our Organization is crucial in conflict prevention, peacebuilding, peacekeeping and the responsibility to protect civilian populations.\nA large part of the migration towards European countries is also economic. One cannot treat with contempt those who, for themselves or for their loved ones, often embark on a long and dangerous journey. We cannot fail to welcome them, but it is difficult to accommodate all of them. At stake, as we know very well today, is the acceptance of our opinions. Populism is being nourished by the feeling that matters are not under control. Some people profit from the confused situation by exploiting it for their own purposes. When I hear, as I did again this week, a political candidate say that a refugee may be a terrorist, I condemn such statements in the firmest possible terms. That is because a person who has left his country is a victim of terrorism, not a perpetrator.\nI believe that we need to keep the paths of legal migration open, not merely because developed countries, notably those in Europe, need them, but also because it would be mistaken and dangerous to declare an end to all migration. Migration, when it is controlled, can constitute an opportunity for everyone. We must, I think, provide sufficient development opportunities to avoid disorderly movements. The approach adopted at the European Union-Africa summit, held in Valletta in 2015, seems to me to be a good one. Europe has committed itself to strengthening assistance to its African partners with increased cooperation on migratory flows at the borders. In the view of my country, it is an additional effort and not challenging to the existing models of cooperation and assistance.\nBut what has happened since the Valletta Summit? The meetings provided an opportunity for dialogue, but it is essential to honour the commitments and to act. I think that the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on 19 September can help to deal with all those problems at an appropriate level: on the global level of our Organization. The population displacement has affected all regions of the world. It also affects those countries that are experiencing precarious situations for their own populations. As the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) invites us to do, we will actively participate in the work for the adoption in 2018 of a global compact on refugees and a global compact for safe, regular and orderly migration.\nArmed conflict, the proliferation of weapons, the lack of development, violent extremism, radicalization and terrorism, threats posed by climate change, poor governance and violations of human rights continue to dominate the daily news. Terrorist attacks have shaken the Middle East and Africa, Europe, the United States and Asia. The effects of climate change manifest themselves in increasingly extreme weather patterns that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable States and populations, creating tension and unrest and pushing people to migrate to places they hope will be more clement. Armed conflicts persist or are likely to break out, endangering the survival of thousands of civilians, exposing them to violence, including sexual violence, and threatening their most basic rights.\nThe African continent remains particularly vulnerable to both internal and external challenges and shocks. I do not wish to recite a litany of ongoing or potential crises. Rather than give a gloomy account of current events, I want to comment on the remarkable development potential of the African continent. I am persuaded that, together, we can act so that peace can become a reality in South Sudan, Somalia, Libya and the Central African Republic. It is up to the parties to those conflicts to bring about their settlement, thereby reducing the suffering of the population and paving the way for sustainable development. The international community is ready to assist and support their efforts for the restoration and consolidation of peace.\nAfrica has formidable resources. In the first place, it has a pool of extraordinary talent represented by its youth. It is important to focus on education, health and job creation in the context of inclusive national development policies that make use of the human potential and natural resources of Africa. Such policies should aim to reduce poverty and inequality, reduce vulnerability to shocks and create countless prospects for the development and flourishing of the peoples.\nAfrica is a continent to which my country, Luxembourg, feels close because of strong ties developed over many years as a result of our development cooperation policy. That partnership is a work in progress and aims to meet the needs of the African countries. Its focus has become increasingly economic, in complement to efforts hitherto concentrated on social sectors.\nThe United Nations remains the place the international community chooses as the forum for addressing the many multidimensional crises and challenges our planet faces today. That is true of sustainable development. It is also the case in regard to combating terrorism. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy has established a political framework to combat terrorism while respecting human rights and individual freedoms. In that context, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.\nWe all must also open the eyes of some young people who in their past behaviour showed no such tendencies yet tomorrow want to fight against their own families. For what reason? Because of religion? Absolutely not. They flout and abuse Islam. They kill their own brothers and sisters. We must condemn such behaviour. No religion can condone such savagery. It is important to remind those young people that no reward awaits them. All they are doing is injuring their own religion.\nThe United Nations also plays a vital role in the maintenance of international peace and security, and a particular role is reserved for the Security Council. All too often, regrettably, the United Nations acts too late when a crisis has already erupted. We firmly endorse efforts to prevent crises or to avoid the recurrence of conflicts.\nLuxembourg strongly supports the Secretary- General\u2019s Human Rights Up Front initiative. Massive violations of human rights are often the first signs of a crisis about to worsen. Since its establishment in 2005, we have played an active part in the work and discussions of the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, and we support the Peacebuilding Fund. The policy guidance and financial support provided by those entities have often been crucial in preventing the relapse of post-conflict countries into conflict, and they contribute to peacebuilding.\nThe adoption by the General Assembly and the Security Council this year of almost identical resolutions to bring about sustainable peace represents a paradigm shift. The resolutions put conflict prevention at the very heart of United Nations action, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, which highlights the need to take effective collective measures to prevent and avert threats to peace.\nLuxembourg fully subscribes to the idea of moving from a post-conflict peacebuilding approach to one of sustaining peace. That includes activities aimed at preventing the outbreak, continuation or recurrence of a conflict, addressing the root causes and ensuring national reconciliation with a view to reconstruction and development. Such an approach, resolutely political, integrates the three pillars of action of the United Nations \u2014 human rights, peace and security, and development. It is inclusive and is characterized by national ownership of efforts to sustain peace, in conformity with the wishes of all members of society and with the ongoing support of the international community. We must turn these words into deeds. The General Assembly can count on Luxembourg in that regard.\nIf there is a conflict that should require us to redouble our efforts, it is the one in Syria. This conflict has given rise to an unprecedented movement of refugees towards neighbouring countries. Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are on the front line, then Europe and beyond. This situation is untenable. We must do everything possible to address this crisis as best we can, observing international law and welcoming and protecting refugees. We must do everything possible to put an end to this dreadful war that is destroying Syria and destabilizing the entire region. For more than five years, Syria has been martyred both by the brutal repression and atrocities carried out by the Al-Assad regime and by the abominable terrorist crimes committed by Da\u2019esh and other terrorist groups that are rife in the country, profiting from a war economy and receiving external support.\nThe toll is terrible. The United Nations estimates that there have been more than 300,000 victims, including tens of thousands of children. An entire generation of children has been exposed to violence and death, deprived of fundamental freedoms, protection and education. Random air bombings and airdrops of barrels of explosives, the use of chemical weapons, violence and violations of international law continue without respite. Sieges are ongoing. Assistance is denied and impediments to humanitarian aid continue. Humanitarian convoys are deliberately targeted.\nI take this opportunity to renew our appeal to the parties, in particular the Syrian authorities, to afford rapid, safe and unobstructed access by United Nations and humanitarian organizations throughout Syria. Even war has rules. And so long as the war lasts, we must demand and ensure that these rules and international humanitarian law are respected. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria, whatever they are, must be brought to justice, including before the International Criminal Court.\nI commend the repeated efforts of the United States of America and Russia. They have led to a new agreement on cessation of hostilities that came into force 10 days ago. This fragile agreement was renounced by the Syrian army, then crippled by the unacceptable attack on a humanitarian convoy on 19 September. It must be respected and scrupulously observed.\nThe solution to the conflict in Syria can be achieved through a political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, in line with the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523, annex) and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). The United Nations must play a determining role to facilitate negotiations among Syrians to bring about a political transition that should include all members of Syrian society.\nOn 4 February, I attendeded, with our Minister for Cooperation and Humanitarian Action, the London 2016 donors conference, entitled \u201cSupporting Syria and the region\u201d. We will adhere to the commitment to provide \u20ac37.5 million between 2016 and 2020 to help the victims of the conflict in Syria and in neighbouring countries, with an emphasis on children\u2019s education, in particular by supporting the UNICEF programme \u201cNo lost generation\u201d.\nLast week, I returned from a visit to Israel and Palestine. While the Syrian conflict is hitting the headlines, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a strong factor for destabilization in the Middle East. It is a catalyst for frustration and hatred that terrorist movements in the region feed on brazenly. We cannot resign ourselves to allowing this conflict to continue. The two-State solution is the only possible way of arriving at a sustainable settlement of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. The parameters of this solution are well known and include the 1967 borders and Jerusalem as the capital of two States.\nDuring my recent visit, I encouraged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to resume direct dialogue. If there is no movement, the international community must play its role. We also support initiatives such as those taken by France to organize an international conference to help the parties to resume negotiations in order to arrive at a two-State solution. We continue to believe that the negotiating format should be broadened, with increased participation of Arab and European countries. In addition, the role of the Security Council should be reactivated and a reasonable deadline for the conclusion of negotiations should be established.\nIsrael has the right to live in peace and security. The Palestinians have the right to a sovereign, independent, democratic, contiguous and viable State. The two go hand in hand. There is no alternative to coexistence, in peace and security. It is important for them to stop talking about each other and instead to talk to each other. Diplomacy can resolve the thorniest of problems. As proof of this, a comprehensive solution to the issue of Iranian nuclear weapons was reached last year.\nWe must remain vigilant when it comes to the implementation Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Nuclear non-proliferation efforts continue to be undermined by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The multiple ballistic missiles launched by North Korea and the recent North Korean nuclear test are in flagrant violation of the international obligations imposed on the country by Security Council resolutions. This provocative escalation is unacceptable. Apart from any Security Council measures that will be taken, the Six-Party Talks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme need to resume in order to bring about verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula by pacific means.\nIn all the areas I have touched upon, we recognize that the United Nations has a leading role to play. As a founding country of the United Nations, Luxembourg has based its foreign policy on its active participation in multilateral cooperation, a multilateralism that is rooted in respect for international law and cooperation among sovereign and equal States. Our commitment to strong and effective multilateralism, with the United Nations at its heart, inspired us during our historic first term on the Security Council, in 2013-2014. This same commitment led my Government to propose Luxembourg as a candidate for a seat on the Security Council for a two-year term in 2031 and 2032. Our candidacy illustrates Luxembourg\u2019s resolve to continue to serve the United Nations as a responsible member of the international community, dedicated to the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.\nI shall leave New York this week with hope in my heart. The many speeches that we have heard in this Hall show that dialogue is possible. Our credibility is at stake. The world expects action, not words. Let us get to work!\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed a great honour and privilege for me to address the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. May I join others in congratulating Mr. Thomson on his election to preside over the deliberations of this session. I am confident that, under his able leadership, the General Assembly will successfully address the pressing issues on its current agenda. I am also confident that he will steer the Organization in the right direction and that we will have fruitful discussions on the well-considered theme of this session, entitled \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d.\nAllow me to also convey my appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who will be concluding his mandate as Secretary-General this year. Through his leadership, Mr. Ban Ki-moon has distinguished himself as a world leader committed to tackling key global challenges, such as reducing poverty and addressing climate change. He has been instrumental in ushering in the Sustainable Development Goals, the successor of the Millennium Development Goals. He has distinguished himself as a global leader, focused on fairness and justice for all nations. Therefore, as he winds up his onerous responsibility as Secretary-General, I would like to convey to him, on behalf of the Zambian people, our best wishes in his future endeavours. Well done. And we thank him once more for his great efforts to improve the lot of humankind.\nWe are meeting during a special period, when our countries are embarking upon the implementation of the current global development blueprint, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Africa appreciates the important synergies of the 2030 Agenda and our own Africa Union Agenda 2063 \u2014 the Africa We Want, which was adopted by the African Union Heads of State and Government at the African Union Summit in January 2015. This convergence is a clear demonstration that our continental aspirations and those of the broader international community are well aligned in terms of achieving a better world for all global citizens.\nMy Government accords the highest priority to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and we believe that there can be no meaningful development without the elimination of poverty. In that context, special attention should be focused on the least developed countries. They are more vulnerable and need more support to strengthen their economies in order to overcome the challenges they face.\nIn our quest to address the issues of poverty, unemployment, hunger and income inequality, Zambia has taken specific measures aimed at promoting economic transformation. Those measures include, but are not limited to, the development of value-chain clusters, the diversification of the agriculture sector, the promotion of forestry and the establishment of multi-facility economic zones and industrial parks. We are strongly resolved to promote industrialization through the agriculture and manufacturing sectors in order to speed up the diversification of the economy away from an over-dependency on mining.\nIn that regard, my Government is addressing the challenges faced by micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, such as access to finance, markets and technology and the enhancement of entrepreneurial skills. These deliberate interventions are expected to spur enterprise growth and job creation. The renewed focus on economic diversification is expected to further transform our country from dependency on primary products to the development of value-added products through industrialization.\nIn our quest to foster economic growth, my Government has developed its seventh five-year national development plan, which will take effect in January 2017. The plan focuses on enhancing productive capacities in the agriculture sector and promoting rural development, which will improve the livelihoods and well-being of rural communities.\nLike most developing nations, Zambia is today faced with the challenges of population growth, and in particular the need to harness the demographic dividend. There is a mismatch between the growth in the youth population and their assimilation into the job market. That is why the Zambian Government is implementing necessary policies focused on skills development, entrepreneurship, education and infrastructure development. Zambia is ready to learn from, and share with, other countries best practices to address the challenges faced by our young people. It is therefore critical that youth remain actively engaged in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe development of appropriate infrastructure is cardinal in fulfilling Africa\u2019s desire to accelerate economic growth and in enhancing the continent\u2019s competitiveness on the global market. Africa must expand intra-African trade and bolster its productive capacities. In line with this, Zambia has embarked upon infrastructure development, including the construction and rehabilitation of roads, railways, bridges and airports.\nAs the current Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries, I wish to reiterate our call for the international community to remain committed to the guidelines of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, which aims to improve the living conditions of the half a billion people who live in the 32 landlocked developing countries.\nIt is evident that climate change has had an adverse impact on the growth of our economies. Zambia has been negatively affected by climate change, which has led to poor crop yields as a result of adverse weather patterns. We have suffered energy deficits as a result of low water levels in our hydropower dams, which account for more than 98 per cent of our power production. We are therefore pursuing a greater energy mix through investment in alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind and geothermal, among others.\nI also wish to join other countries that are calling for the provision of adequate resources to make fully operational the Green Climate Fund, as that would greatly contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation. Zambia applauds the landmark Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It calls for fulfilment of the pledges made by parties at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .\nZambia also recognizes the importance of food security, and it therefore reaffirms its commitment to prioritizing a range of agricultural practices, including appropriate technologies that respond to climate change, such as conservation agriculture for sustainable and increased food production. Zambia supports calls for improved access to global and local agro-food markets, including transparent and open trading systems, as long as they do not negatively impact on local production. We therefore invite more investments in agro-processing industries to add value to our products and increase employment opportunities.\nZambia is making major strides in addressing various challenges in the health sector. We want to ensure easy access to health services by all our citizens. We are making steady progress in addressing communicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We are decentralizing primary health-care services and improving the financing mechanisms for major communicable diseases to strengthen the health systems.\nAt the regional level, the strengthening of the Southern African Development Community Strategy on Pooled Procurement of Essential Medicines and Health Commodities is among the positive interventions that are contributing to our improved health systems. Current interventions in relation to HIV and AIDS include the prevention of mother-to-child transmission and the treatment of all children who are HIV-positive. Our overall goal is to reach a zero-infection rate, in line with the global HIV and AIDS aspirations.\nThe Zambian Government has put in place policy measures to ensure that our people have access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including family planning. In addition, my Government has increased the number of health centres, in both rural and urban areas, where these services are accessed.\nZambia has made efforts to strengthen the legal framework for gender equity and equality by enacting the Gender Equity and Equality Act of 2015. That progressive law has put into effect domestically the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, and the Southern African Development Community Protocol on Gender and Development. At the continental level, in 2016 Zambia was among 11 countries presented with a gender award for the promotion of gender economic rights. In 2015, I was also humbled to receive the title of promoter of the He for She campaign from UN-Women in recognition of the role that Zambia has played in the area of women\u2019s empowerment.\nThis exemplifies the special attention and efforts that Zambia has continued to devote to issues related to the empowerment of women and young people in order to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. The measures that my Government has taken include promoting women\u2019s participation in commerce, trade and industry. In order to address some of the challenges that women face, we need support for the creation of lines of credit for women\u2019s empowerment programmes, skills development, employment creation, poverty reduction, and technical assistance in fostering environmentally friendly agricultural methods.\nAfrica needs strong institutions, not necessarily strong men. In that regard, Zambia is endeavouring to build a peaceful, just and inclusive society, particularly by consolidating democracy. The importance of democracy in our societies cannot be overemphasized. It is an extremely important aspect of our political systems that empowers people to freely participate in governance. As the Assembly is aware, Zambia held elections on 11 August, and they did indeed represent another opportunity for Zambia to demonstrate its commitment to upholding and promoting the tenets of democracy. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the international community for supporting us during the process. Equally, I would like to thank the Zambian people for their peaceful conduct during the elections. I want to assure the Assembly that my Government will use its mandate to continue protecting our peaceful democratic legacy and meeting the aspirations of our people.\nMy Government yearns for a community of nations that recognizes and respects the sovereign equality of all nations, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. As States Members of the United Nations, we all have positive roles to play in promoting peace and security in order to attain sustainable development for present and future generations. However, Zambia is concerned about the fact that the world today continues to witness unbridled acts of conflict and terrorism and rising levels of poverty, which remain overarching and pressing challenges to our aspirations. We must therefore eradicate conflict if we are to attain the Sustainable Development Goals.\nZambia, as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council, will dedicate its three-year term on that important decision-making body to promoting peace and security on the African continent. I therefore reiterate Zmbia\u2019s continued commitment to the ongoing efforts for peace and conflict resolution of the Southern African Development Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the African Union. We believe that the solution to African problems lies in Africa finding its own solutions. We nonetheless welcome and express our gratitude to the international community for its continued support to conflict resolution and peace processes on the continent.\nWhile Zambia believes that the United Nations should be at the core of global governance and efforts to meet the challenges of collective peace, security and development, there is a pressing need to reform the Organization so that it can reflect the contemporary realities of today\u2019s global order. Zambia therefore fully supports the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, representing the African common position on reform of the Security Council. It is not right that Africa remains the only continent without permanent representation on the Security Council. That historical injustice must be corrected. We therefore urge Member States, including those that have vested interests in maintaining the status quo, to give due consideration to this legitimate demand from Africa. We all have an obligation to make the Security Council more representative, democratic and accountable if the Organization is going to demand democracy, representation and accountability from its Member States.\nZambia\u2019s belief in the ideals and role of the Security Council remains unshaken, and it is in that regard that I reiterate our steadfast commitment to continuing to contribute to the operations and well-being of the United Nations.\n\u2003\n"

        "file_text": "I welcome this opportunity to address the General Assembly for the first time since my election as President of the Union of the Comoros. I am very grateful to the people of the Comoros, who have made it possible for me to speak here on their behalf.\nI would like, from this lofty rostrum, to congratulate the people of the Comoros, who have been able to turn the page in terms of achieving political stability and to put aside useless discord to work together for the benefit of future generations.\nI am indeed the fourth President in 20 years to have been elected in a free, transparent and democratic election with internationally recognized results. My country has experienced its third peaceful handover of power, in which the opposition replaced the legitimate incumbent following peaceful elections.\nI thank the international community and all of our partners, and the United Nations system in particular, for having always stood by our side. I hope that after the election their assistance will help us to consolidate political stability and to preserve democracy and the rule of law, so as to bring about the economic and social development of the country and the well-being of our people.\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, on his election to head this seventy-first session. I am convinced that his experience and his proven knowledge of international issues, added to his personal brilliance, will lead the Assembly to great success at this session. I cannot fail to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for having brilliantly led the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\nLet me also hail the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. He has shown great talent throughout his term. As he nears the time to relinquish his duties, I wish to join in the unanimous tributes to his commitment to promoting peace, development and fighting climate change. The people and the Government of the Comoros are deeply grateful for the interest he has always shown in the development of the Union of the Comoros and, in particular, for the special attention that he paid to our most recent electoral process, ensuring its smooth running and its final results, which were unanimously accepted.\nLet me lastly applaud all those who have spoken from this rostrum for their pertinent remarks, in particular His Excellency President Barack Obama, who is also approaching the end of his term. He perfectly represents the United States of America \u2013 the tolerant America, the generous America, respectful of the universal values of freedom and the rule of law, and the America that the world wants.\nThe theme of the current session is \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. It fits in perfectly with the decision taken by international leaders 15 years ago to establish a set of world objectives: the Millennium Development Goals. The theme also encourages us to build on the considerable progress made in the years that have followed: a steady decline in poverty throughout the world, an increasing number of children in school, spectacular gains in lowering child mortality, greater access to drinking water, and progress in the fight against malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis, which has helped to save millions of lives.\nIndeed, considerable efforts have been made to help our world achieve greater prosperity, equality, freedom and respect for human dignity, and to become a place where research and peacekeeping tirelessly persevere. Furthermore, the ambitious new long-term programme that we adopted last year to improve the lives of our population and to protect the planet for future generations enables us to optimistically perceive a future when we can reduce poverty, improve health and education, build a more sustainable habitat, fight climate change and protect our oceans and forests.\nHowever, the issue of refugees and migrants, which has been the focus of our debate since the start of the current session, requires urgent action. We are all well aware that those migrant men and women do not put their lives at risk, perilously travelling over land and sea, for pleasure or for tourism; instead, they are fleeing from war, poverty and misery. The theme of this session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, comes at just the right time, as it allows us to envisage sustainable development and even to stabilize populations at home, so that they can move only out of choice and in perfect harmony.\nAnd so it is up to our Organization, and therefore each one of us, to take immediate action to stop the violence that is a result of all kinds of extremism and fanaticism, leading to heinous and barbaric acts around the world, particularly in Africa, which is currently experiencing terrorism that knows no borders. Terrorists are neither Muslim nor Jewish, neither Catholic nor animist. They do not belong to any religion or any civilization \u2014 they are merely barbarians. That is why my country, the Union of the Comoros, is willing to support all actions aimed at fighting the scourge of terrorism.\nIt is also urgent that our Organization, that is to say every Member State, finally agree on a definitive, fair and sustainable solution to the Israel-Arab conflict, based on a two-State solution and in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. Nothing can justify our silent response to the terror of that conflict with its toll of victims, which is fuelled both by the extremism that comes from all sides and by our culpable inertia. Nothing can justify the arrogance of those who, from this very rostrum, defy the world by taunting this world body, an Organization that provides a framework for all to recognize the sovereignty of States, to participate in international affairs and to seek peaceful solutions to the problems afflicting us.\nFor my part, I wish to convey the trust of my people in the United Nations, an Organization that has acknowledged our sovereignty and independence, and that, 41 years later, makes it possible for us to be here. I believe that finding a solution to the issue of the sovereignty of the Palestinian people and resolving that 70-year-old conflict will spur the resolution of other conflicts in the Near and Middle East.\nAllow me, at this stage in my address, to respectfully draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the need to draw a distinction between migrants and internally displaced persons. My country, the Union of Comoros, had its sovereignty recognized by the United Nations in 1975. It is made up of four islands, and, like other countries, we have observed the subsequent, unavoidable movement of our population within islands and between islands, including the island of Mayotte \u2014 which is, unfortunately, still under French administration. Those trips are made to visit family, celebrate marriages, go to the burial of a close relative and for various other reasons. And yet they descend into chaos on a daily basis \u2014 every year and every month, those trips lead to deaths of hundreds of our fellow citizens in the channel between the three islands and the island of Mayotte, to the indifference of the international community.\nThe Assembly is fully aware of the issue concerning the island of Mayotte and has devoted no fewer than 15 resolutions to the issue since 1977. Unfortunately, it has yet to be resolved. We hope that, with the Assembly\u2019s multifaceted support, a viable solution will be found to accommodate both the Comoros and France \u2014 two countries that, in spite of that dispute, have remained partners and have established friendly relations over the years. I am convinced that the dialogue that I initiated with President Chirac in 2005, and which has been pursued by successive French and Comorian Governments, will help to solve our unpleasant dispute. We must engage in frank and intelligent dialogue, respecting the interests of both parties and, above all, international law, in order to make it possible for future generations of French, Comorian and Franco-Comorian people to live in peace and harmony and to be protected from the radicalization and extremism that have weakened regions all over the world.\nToday, the United Nations is the only place where the world\u2019s population can come together and look towards a common future of shared peace and prosperity \u2014 for which we have high expectation from this Organization, which regulates the international system. However, our Organization is increasingly perceived as inefficient in terms of defending the rights of the most deprived in relation to the most powerful. The Union of the Comoros is also in favour of broad reform of the United Nations, echoing the ideas of a large number of countries, in particular with regard to the need to grant Africa a permanent seat on the Security Council. We believe that respect for international law, the sovereignty of States and the integrity of their territories will contribute to greater peace and prosperity throughout the world.\nThere are other challenges to be overcome before we can achieve sustainable development. We must eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all within the framework of the new Agenda within the next 15 years. As a small island developing State, the Union of the Comoros seeks to turn the private sector and civil society, together with the Administration, into drivers of the struggle to transform economic growth, in particular in Africa, so as to provide decent job prospects for young people, improve services, develop agriculture and reduce inequalities deriving from income, gender and living environments. All that is so we can deal successfully with the emerging problem of climate change.\nI want to end on an optimistic note. Getting back to the theme of the Sustainable Development Goals, I want to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, President of the French Republic, and congratulate him on the success of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. His commitment and capacity for mobilization enabled the eventual adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. My country signed the agreement and will submit it for ratification by the Parliament during its session in October.\nOn this occasion, I wish every success to His Majesty King Mohammed VI, whose beautiful country, Morocco, will host, in Marrakesh in 2017, the twenty- second session of the Conference of the Parties . With the permission of my friend, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, I invite the entire international community to go on that occasion to Morocco, which fully deserves to host the twenty-second Conference of the Parties. The success of the Conference will contribute to reducing insecurity, which is a destabilizing factor in many regions in the world, particularly in Africa, where people have been the most likely to resort to migration, which is a global concern that we addressed on the opening days of our session. Indeed, the success of the Conference will be reflected in improvements in our daily life and will provide a tangible contribution to people\u2019s well-being and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "I feel honoured to participate for the first time, as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova, in the work of the General Assembly.\nLet me start by warmly congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election. My delegation wishes you every success in your important mandate as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I would like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Moldova, our appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his work as Secretary-General and his valuable efforts aimed at redefining the role of the United Nations and adapting it to a world in continuous flux.\nI would also like to thank the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for showing leadership and dedication during the previous session and for promoting an inclusive and transparent approach to the process of selecting a new Secretary- General. We believe that such an innovative approach should be used in future and that the criteria of equitable geographic representation should be formalized so as to allow all regional groups to have been represented in the highest elected post at the United Nations.\nWe call on all States Members of the United Nations, particularly members of the Security Council, to elect a Secretary-General from the Eastern European region, the only region that has not been represented in this high position despite its having put forward a number of qualified candidates. The issue of gender equality should be also considered in the selection process. We believe that a possible decision to elect a woman as the United Nations Secretary-General will have positive resonance with the growing international expectations in this regard.\nThe year 2016 has indeed been a difficult year for the Organization. Serious conflicts and crises have continued to have a negative impact on international peace, security and stability. We have witnessed new and tragic manifestations of conflict in various parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. All of us are deeply concerned by the ramifications and consequences of these conflicts, particularly the conflict in Syria.\nInternational terrorism and various forms of violent extremism, fed by offensive ideologies, have continued to strike indiscriminately in countries everywhere, including Europe. The Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy and the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism lay out the activities that need to be undertaken, individually and collectively, bearing in mind that some of their provisions complement our national legislation, in particular the law of the Republic of Moldova on countering extremist activities.\nThe Republic of Moldova welcomes the General Assembly high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants and the Leaders\u2019 Summit on Refugees held earlier this week. The two high-level meetings allowed the participating States and organizations to discuss principles and policies designed to address migration and the refugee crisis. We share the deep concern expressed about the challenges the international system is facing in this regard. The large movements of people, the scale of migration and the refugee crises, unprecedented since the Second World War, require a global humanitarian partnership capable of delivering the needed protection, as provided for by the international law.\nIn our view, it is important to bear in mind the complex nature of motives that drive people to move and to make a clear distinction among them. The solutions identified should be tailored to every individual situation, and a comprehensive global long- term solution should be outlined, one that goes beyond an ad hoc emergency response. In this context, we appreciate the indispensable contribution made by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which joins the United Nations system as a full-fledged agency pursuant to the Agreement concerning the Relationship between the United Nations and the IOM signed on 19 September. We must also fight smuggling and trafficking in persons in a comprehensive and resolute manner.\nThe Republic of Moldova also attaches critical importance to fostering development partnerships aimed at supporting countries in need of assistance to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In our view, the United Nations development system is indispensable for forging such partnerships, including at the country level. We note with interest the progress achieved by those countries whose efforts to implement the SDGs are already under way. Many were presented at the 2016 High-level Political Forum held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, where the Republic of Moldova serves as a member.\nThe Moldovan Government, partnering with the United Nations Development Programme and other stakeholders, launched a process of localizing the SDGs and is currently working on putting in place a mechanism to measure progress in their implementation. For coordination and monitoring purposes, the National Coordination Council for Regional Development was established in July within the Office of the Prime Minister. To ensure synergy between the SDGs and the national development framework, we plan to review our national strategy for development, \u201cMoldova 2020\u201d.\nMindful of the constraints in the current international environment \u2014 which is not promising in terms of increases in aid \u2014 we should look globally and nationally at ways to develop innovative sources of financing and increase the effectiveness of existing aid. The efforts of the Moldovan Government to increase aid effectiveness continue to be guided by the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.\nCoordination with development partners in the Republic of Moldova in this area is based on the Partnership Principles Implementation Plan. We believe that through the effective use of resources, this institutionalized model of coordination and partnership will facilitate the gradual achievement of the SDGs in our country. In this context, I would also like to stress our interest in obtaining development financing and assistance for climate and disaster resilience, in the light of the climate-related vulnerabilities of our country.\nWe recognize climate-change risks and implications for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Republic of Moldova supported the negotiation and adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I take this opportunity today to inform the Assembly that the Republic of Moldova signed the historic Agreement at the recent treaty event, an action that will be followed soon by ratification of the Agreement by our Parliament.\nPerhaps never before has there been such a clear correlation between migration, sustainable development and climate change, on the one hand, and peace and security, on the other. We cannot realistically expect to fulfil the 2030 Agenda in the absence of peace and security, just as peace and security will always be vulnerable in the absence of sustainable development.\nThe unprecedented increase in the number of regional and internal conflicts, the intensification of armed violence at the global level and the resurgent arms race are only a few ingredients that have fundamentally changed the international environment. International terrorism and all forms of violent extremism have continued to caused innocent human causalities and material losses everywhere, including in Europe. The horrific scenes of suffering and death in France, Belgium, Germany and many other countries, widely broadcast by the global media networks, show that these phenomena cannot be countered by military, political or economic means alone. We must look for solutions that will address rather than exacerbate the threat, based on a clear understanding of the factors that generate terrorism, fundamentalism, fanaticism and the new forms of violence.\nWe note with appreciation the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives aimed at reforming the Organization to make it more effective. The Republic of Moldova welcomes the ongoing United Nations reform process, particularly regarding Security Council reform. Too often, that principal body has been criticized for its failure to maintain international peace and security. It is therefore essential to make it more efficient in discharging its primary responsibilities.\nIn our view, efficiency can be achieved by improving the Council\u2019s representativeness, legitimacy, transparency and accountability, as well as by restricting the right of veto on issues of substance, as provided for by the Charter of the United Nations. We expect the members of the Security Council, especially the permanent members, not only to react but to act preventively, promptly and impartially whenever peace and security are threatened, the principles of international law are disregarded or the sovereignty and integrity of the States Members of the United Nations are blatantly violated.\nUnder the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter, certain regional organizations have been entrusted by the United Nations with dealing with a number of conflicts that are not a principal focus of the Council\u2019s work. In our view, more systematic outreach to these regional organizations is needed. Steps should also be taken to increase their accountability, particularly in the case of protracted conflicts, when the situation is not improving or is even worsening over the years.\nLack of progress should prompt more direct involvement from the appropriate United Nations bodies. We believe that no conflict falls outside the purview of the United Nations, regardless of whether it is on the Security Council\u2019s agenda or not. In this context, we welcome the high-level event on strengthening the capabilities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as a Chapter VIII organization, organized by the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at the margins of the seventy-first session of the General Assembly, which allowed the participants to discuss issues relevant to the aforementioned considerations.\nAccordingly, we appreciate the fact that the General Assembly agreed to include in its agenda item 32, \u201cProtracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development\u201d. These unresolved conflicts \u2014 some, like the one in the Republic of Moldova, date back 25 years \u2014 continue to have a negative impact on the political, social and economic development of the GUAM States. The General Assembly\u2019s debates under this item do not, as some fear, undermine the existing mechanism to negotiate the settlement of these conflicts. On the contrary, the ongoing monitoring of the situation in the areas in question, along with a proactive approach by the United Nations, when necessary, can effectively address attempts aimed at changing the political borders of some GUAM States through methods that run counter to democracy and international law.\nThe Transnistrian conflict that the Republic of Moldova has endured for many years is, first and foremost, a product of the long-standing geopolitical interests associated with our region. External factors played a decisive role in igniting this conflict in the early 1990s. It was triggered shortly after the Republic of Moldova declared independence, on the very day our country was granted United Nations membership, 2 March 1992. Unlike other internal conflicts that are generated and fostered by ethnic and religious antagonisms, the Transnistrian conflict has a purely geopolitical character. In theory, that feature of the conflict makes it easier to resolve and therefore strengthens our conviction that it can be resolved through the resolute joint political efforts of all the parties involved.\nThe similar ethnic composition of the populations living on both sides of the Nistru river and their mutual lack of hatred or intolerance towards one another speak for themselves and illustrate both the artificial character of the Transnistrian entity and the falsity of its ideological and political tenets. The recurrent declarations by the exponents of the Transnistrian regime on the need to make the territory it controls a part of another country, with no common borders with Moldova, are not only unrealistic but also seriously undermine the settlement process.\nDespite the many difficulties encountered in the settlement process, the Moldovan authorities are determined to find a political solution to the Transnistrian conflict, using the 5+2 negotiating format and based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, by way of granting special legal status to the Transnistrian region. We are firmly convinced that the only way to reach this goal is through negotiations. However, negotiations can succeed only if all the stakeholders show the needed political will, act in good faith and refrain from putting forward rigid preconditions in negotiating the political aspects of the settlement.\nWhat is the right path to final settlement? We believe that the joint and resolute actions of all parties to the 5+2 settlement format on the basis of a common agenda and common objectives are what is required, as are enhanced confidence-building and the bringing together of the people on both banks of the river Nistru in all spheres of social and economic life. It will also entail the identification of solutions for topical issues and the engagement in serious and objective political discussions on the future of the Transnistrian region as an integral part of the Republic of Moldova. In addition, it will involve a firm commitment to maintaining stability and refraining from stoking tensions.\nOnly by acting in this way will we be able to stop and prevent the violation of human rights in the Transnistrian region, discourage unilateral destabilization and gradually create an environment of confidence and trust. That is the path the Moldovan authorities will continue to follow, which, hopefully, will deliver the desired result \u2014 a viable and comprehensive settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and the reintegration of the Republic of Moldova.\nWith respect to factors that have a negative impact on the political environment and regional security, I would like to reiterate our deep concern over the lack of progress in the withdrawal of Russian armaments and troops stationed on our territory without the prior consent of the Moldovan authorities, contrary to the provisions of the our Constitution. Likewise, we are deeply concerned about the increasing frequency of military exercises involving foreign troops, which are often conducted jointly with the military and paramilitary units of the Transnistrian regime.\nThe fragile security conditions in our region as a whole, amplified by the destabilizing factors in eastern Ukraine, require a constructive re-engagement of all States participating in the 5+2 settlement format, as well of other relevant or interested actors, particularly the OSCE and the United Nations, with a view to identifying as swiftly as possible responses and solutions for these long-standing problems, in conformity with the international law. We expect the General Assembly to focus constructively on the Transnistrian and other protracted conflicts, particularly when it considers the annual resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.\nThis year, the Republic of Moldova is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence. In that time, we have achieved many but not all of the objectives that we set for ourselves. We have nevertheless laid the foundations for a democratic society, based on European political, economic and social values. We are fully committed to the idea of European integration, which has become our national project, and our journey on that path is being guided by the Association Agreement we concluded with the European Union. The Republic of Moldova is currently in a period of transition, during which our main priorities are the reforms that should facilitate our country\u2019s modernization and enhance its institutions. The Government that I am privileged to lead is determined to finalize ongoing, meaningful reforms and will rely on the support of external partners in that critical endeavour.\nDuring the past 25 years as a State Member of the United Nations, Moldova has shared the common values, responsibilities, achievements and setbacks of the Organizations. On this occasion, I would like to reiterate the Republic of Moldova\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and its strong desire to cooperate with all States Members of the United Nations with a view to fulfilling the noble purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my distinct pleasure to attend the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. I sincerely congratulate Ambassador Peter Thomson of the Republic of Fiji on having been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts and wise leadership in support of fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and justice for all over a decade. We wish him every success in his future endeavours.\nThe twenty-first century has brought with it an ever-complex international arena, in which certain old conflicts have lingered and been exacerbated, while new threats and challenges \u2014 in the form of violent extremism and terrorism, displacement and migration, climate change and other challenges \u2014 have emerged, threatening all of humankind. We have come to realize that dialogue and cooperation provide the most viable avenue to promote peace and security and ensure a world without hatred and conflict.\nWe believe that the United Nations remains the single most important international body for promoting global peace, security and prosperity, and that achieving a stronger Organization remains a priority for all of us in the way forward. The United Nations vital role in helping Afghanistan to transition into a democratic and pluralistic society is a clear example of its profound impact in helping to create real change for bettering societies and communities around the world. Allow me to update the Assembly on the current state of affairs in my country.\nWhile two years have passed since the establishment of the Government of National Unity of Afghanistan, I would like to briefly present an overview of the achievements of my Government under the leadership of Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the elected President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. We in Afghanistan aim to strengthen the spirit of national participation and cooperation so as to take into account the wishes and will Afghan citizens. Based on national consensus, all groups, political figures and Afghan elites inside and outside the Government are jointly sharing ideas now how to strengthen the political system and the Government of National Unity and to implement reforms within the framework of our national interests.\nThe Afghan nation has inherited a legacy of conflict, oppression, discrimination and inequality. We believe that democracy is the best solution to these problems, as it provides the only foundation to ensure justice and equality and to enable social and political groups to be adequately represented. We have a modern Constitution that provides for this goal, and only its full implementation can ensure political stability in our society.\nOur Government has registered considerable achievements in different areas over the past two years, including in reducing maternal and child mortality, increasing access to education, improving basic freedoms, strengthening the telecommunications and information sectors, improving the rule of law and preserving justice and human rights. Internationally, our Government enjoys its due status, having proved to be a trustworthy partner to the many countries that are engaged in Afghanistan and invested in the security and stability of the country.\nWe are sparing no effort to implement our commitments to reform. We are pursuing our well-planned and systematic efforts to eliminate corruption, strengthen good governance, undertake judicial reform, promote women\u2019s empowerment, ensure effective service delivery for our citizens and accountability standards at all levels of Government, institutionalize merit-based appointments of senior officials and secure transparency in Government contracts, with the establishment of the National Procurement Authority.\nIn order to strengthen transparency of our future parliamentary, presidential and district council elections, the process of consultations and technical and legal studies on reforming our electoral bodies and laws have been concluded, and initial steps towards electoral reforms will begin very soon.\nCombating the threat of narcotics is another priority of the National Unity Government. In this regard, we are cooperating closely with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and other international partners, and will maintain our joint efforts within the national action plan framework.\nAt the 2016 NATO Warsaw Summit in July, NATO members and our other allies pledged to provide $1 billion in support on an annual basis for the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) until the end of 2020. The Resolute Support Mission, which offers support in training, advice and assistance to ANDSF, was also extended beyond 2016. We extend a particular debt of gratitude to the United States of America for providing the largest share of support.\nIn less than two weeks time, Afghanistan and our international partners will come together at the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan to review, and reach important decisions on, the full scope of the joint partnership in the way forward. The National Unity Government will present a comprehensive update on the positive trajectory of our reform efforts, conducted on the basis of the Self-Reliance through Mutual Accountability Framework. We look forward to our international partners making new pledges of assistance on the basis of Afghanistan\u2019s National Peace and Development Framework.\nDespite these achievements, the ongoing undeclared war against Afghanistan and the need for security remain a serious challenge for the National Unity Government, as our people are still subject to the merciless attacks of terrorist groups. Currently, more than 10 terrorist groups, sent from outside the country with the goal of impeding our State-building efforts and preventing the establishment of peace and stability, are fighting against us in Afghanistan. One of their main objectives is to suppress democracy, freedom of speech, and our free and independent media. That is why our journalists are subject to serious threats while reporting from the battlefields and during terrorist attacks. Afghanistan asks the United Nations to appoint a special representative for the safety of journalists, focused on protecting all journalists, including those serving in Afghanistan.\nOver the past several months, terrorist groups, including the Taliban and Da\u2019esh, which continue to enjoy foreign support, have attacked a peaceful and civil demonstration of the Enlightenment Movement in Deh Mazang square in Kabul, and killed dozens of our educated youth and elite. They have also attacked the American University of Afghanistan and other civilian facilities, killing hundreds of innocent civilians. Based on existing evidence, these attacks were planned and organized from the other side of the Durand Line, inside Pakistani territory.\nThis year, the Taliban has tried to take control of more areas in the country, especially in Kunduz and Helmand provinces, but have been confronted by the ANDSF. As a result, hundreds of extremist militants of the Taliban and Da\u2019esh, many of whom were foreign fighters, were killed or captured. We call on the international community to focus on eliminating terrorist safe havens located outside of the country. We urge States to honestly implement their international pledges in the fight against terrorism and to avoid the dual policy of distinguishing between good and bad terrorists, which undermines the international order.\nWhere were the previous leaders of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda residing, and where were they killed? At this very moment, where are the leaders of the Taliban and the Haqqani network located? Where and how are terrorists being trained, equipped and financed to wage a full-scale war? We have repeatedly asked our neighboring country Pakistan to destroy the known terrorist safe havens, but we have unfortunately yet to witness any change in the situation. Afghanistan has always desired peaceful relations with all countries of the region, but the Government of National Unity reserves the right to do whatever is necessary to defend and protect our people.\nWe have also kept the doors of peace and negotiations open to those Taliban elements and other armed opposition groups that are willing to renounce violence, return to peaceful life and adhere to our Constitution. In this connection, a peace agreement is about to be signed between our Government and the Hezb-e-Islami party. That will be an important step for progress in our peace process.\nWe believe that the Quadrilateral Coordination Group on the Afghan Peace and Reconciliation Process \u2014 composed of Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Pakistan and the United States \u2014 can remain a useful platform to further peace efforts so long as the Government of Pakistan acts in good faith to meet and fulfil its commitments within the parameters of the Group\u2019s road map.\nDespite our security challenges, Afghanistan has always maintained a positive approach to our relations with all regional countries and the Islamic world. We consider Islamic countries to be our best partners and seek to strengthen our cultural, social and economic ties and to use our experience to promote peace and coexistence and present a moderate interpretation of Islam. In this regard, we welcome the express readiness of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation and any Islamic country to help promote the peace agenda in Afghanistan. I would add that Islam is a religion with a clear thought, culture, civilization and history that respects human dignity, rights and freedoms, and derives national sovereignty from the will of the people. It is also against any kind of injustice, exclusivism, hatred, radicalism and violence.\nThose individuals and groups that resort to violence, terror and killing under any name are not acquainted with the spirit of this humane religion, and are in fact using Islam only as a tool to achieve their evil goals. How can Islam possibly permit terrorism and suicide attacks, or the taking of the lives of thousands of innocent people, when it clearly considers the human individual to be the representative of God on Earth, assigning him dignity and offering him heavenly insight in the holy verses of the Quran? Islam also considers the killing of one innocent human to be equal to killing all humankind. We expect the prominent Islamic scholars who will soon take part in an important conference in the holy city of Mecca to further elucidate the true image of Islam and declare their condemnation of terrorists and extremists on behalf of our great religion.\nIn order to achieve regional cooperation, we need a stable region. Afghanistan\u2019s foreign policy is founded on the creation of a secure economy-based society. Afghanistan is an active member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the European Community Humanitarian Office, as well an observer member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and seeks to play an active role in the revitalization of the Regional Cooperation Agenda within the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process.\nAfghanistan and all countries of its region share common threats and common interests. We should come together and cooperate in the fight against our common threats, which include terrorism, radicalism, drugs, organized crime, illegal immigration and smuggling. The establishment of a regional railroad, energy transit, mine extraction, trade and transportation infrastructure can provide us with an important opportunity for joint economic cooperation.\nAfghanistan, as an important crossroads for trade, transport and economic activities, can connect South Asia to Central Asia, and the Middle East to East and South Asia. Afghanistan has already made significant progress through projects such as the Turkmenistan- Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline; the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project; the Lapis Lazuli Corridor; a railway corridor between China, Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia; and extended cooperation with Iran regarding Chabahar Port. The implementation of these projects will allow Afghanistan to reach international markets and improve connections between the regional countries.\nWith respect to the principles of non-interference in the affairs of other countries; avoiding the use of force in the resolution of conflicts; respect for territorial integrity and national sovereignty; the exchange of knowledge, science and technology; and, most importantly, the promotion of peace and lasting security and stability, we can prepare for the economic growth of all countries of our region. We therefore call on all our neighbouring countries to cooperate with us in the provision of security and stability throughout the region.\nIn November 1946, Afghanistan was the first country to become a United Nations Member State after the 51 founding countries, and since then it has solemnly adhered to its international commitments. Over the past 16 years, we have served as a point of convergence at which the international community has been able to come together. In this regard and on behalf of the Afghan nation, I also wish to highlight and thank the United Nations for the central role it has played in facilitating effective international support for the stability and prosperity of Afghanistan. In recent years, we have signed documents for long-term strategic cooperation with 20 of our allies, including the United States, the European Union and NATO, which have announced their valuable support for the policies and decisions of the Afghan Government at important conferences in Bonn, Tokyo, London, Chicago and Warsaw.\nAfghanistan, like other members of the international community, is serious and resolute in its fight against radicalism and violence and will continue to battle this ominous phenomenon. For years, our nation has been on the front line of the fight against terrorism and has made tremendous sacrifices in defence of the common values of humanity. We have lost many of our great national figures, including the martyrs Ahmad Shah Massoud, Ustad Burhanuddin Rabbani, Ustad Abdul Ali Mazari and Abdul Haq, as well as hundreds of ulamas, Members of Parliament, officers, journalists and members of our political elites.\nWe believe that terrorism and radicalism have become global threats to world peace. We have seen signs of radicalism emerge in different forms throughout Europe and America and incidents of terrorist attacks in many countries around the world. Given the extent of these threats, the measures taken by the international community in the fight against terrorism and radicalism will never be sufficient or successful unless effective, comprehensive measures encompassing political, cultural, economic and even military aspects are considered to be a universal strategic necessity.\nThe United Nations should hold an international conference on the fight against radicalism with the aim of introducing a new legal framework to combat terrorism. We believe that serious efforts in the fight against terrorism and radicalism require thorough and precise planning for at least 20 years. Afghanistan, which is on the front line of this fight, should receive special attention from the international community in this regard.\nOne of the ominous outcomes of violence and radicalism is the new wave of immigration over the past year, which has emerged as an important international challenge. We thank those countries that offer support to Afghan immigrants, especially Germany and other European countries that have welcomed Afghan refugees with open arms and a humane, loving spirit. We also ask the United Nations and its Member States to take a new approach towards this international challenge and help countries of origin to address the root causes of and reasons for immigration, particularly the ominous phenomena of war, poverty and illiteracy.\nA glimpse into global conditions shows that injustice, threat, violence and conflict are still endangering millions of human lives throughout the world. We have seen devastation and terror in Syria. We announce our full support for a comprehensive solution to the Syrian conflict that reflects the will of all Syrians. We also hope to see a comprehensive and peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen.\nWe support new international efforts to resolve the issue of Palestine and to provide the brave and noble Palestinian people with their legitimate rights, including the right to have an independent Government. We invite all sides to initiate direct talks so as to achieve a sustainable solution based on the principles of peace and peaceful coexistence.\nAfghanistan supports the historic agreement between the 5+1 countries and the Islamic Republic of Iran on the Iranian nuclear programme within the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and views the implementation of the agreement as constructive for the restoration of peace, stability and sustainable development in the region and the world. With regard to nuclear programmes, I should add that we believe that the Democratic Republic of North Korea\u2019s tests of nuclear weapons are dangerous for the region and can endanger world peace and security.\nSince 2001, when it began a new chapter of its modern history, Afghanistan has regained its historical place among the responsible members of the family of nations represented in the General Assembly. Through words and deeds, we have shown our full and abiding commitment to upholding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and played our due role in promoting global peace, justice, human rights and the rule of law. It is in that context that we have presented our candidacy to the Human Rights Council for 2018- 2020. We call respectfully and amicably on all our friends and Member States to support our candidacy in the upcoming election.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate, on behalf of the Afghan people and Government, our deepest gratitude to all our international partners that have stood beside us in our quest for peace, security and prosperity over the past 16 years, and I especially thank the troops of NATO and the International Security Assistance Force for the sacrifices they have made in the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan. Together, we have come a long way in our journey, but our task is undoubtedly unfinished. We look to the Assembly\u2019s continued support over the coming years and remain confident in realizing the goals that we have jointly set to achieve.\nI wish to highlight once again Afghanistan\u2019s firm commitment to the realization of a world in which peace, harmony, justice and tranquillity prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people of Panama, to whom I send a warm embrace from this rostrum, I am pleased to participate in the general debate of the General Assembly in order to share my thoughts on the progress and challenges that lie ahead for my country, the region and the world as they work to ensure peace, welfare and prosperity for our peoples.\nI would like to begin by recognizing the Secretary- General for his outstanding work at the United Nations over the past 10 years, in which we have achieved historic agreements aimed at benefiting both present and future generations of humankind.\nPanama is a country of dialogue and discussion, a multi-ethnic, multicultural, peace-loving nation, where people from all over the world who have found a new home on our land live and cooperate peacefully. Our motto \u2014 \u201cPanama, bridge of the world, heart of the universe\u201d \u2014 is growing ever stronger, and we are making progress under a Government committed to the democratic system, called to fulfil the role that stems from our geographical position.\nToday I am pleased to inform the Assembly that on 26 June, we succeeded in completing the expansion of the Panama Canal, through which more than 120 New\nPanamax ships, capable of carrying cargoes three times larger than previously, have already travelled. The expansion, which was done mainly with Panamanian labour, has filled our nation with rightful pride and joy. With that major step, we Panamanians have fulfilled our commitment to continuing to bring the world closer together, facilitate global trade and put our country at the service of the international community. With the expansion finished, we are now preparing to move forward with studies that will enable us to increase the water-retention capacity of the Canal watershed in order to ensure a sufficient supply of drinking water to our major cities and uninterrupted operation of the inter-oceanic route. I would like to take this opportunity to invite the international community to visit our country and appreciate this masterpiece of engineering.\nIn Panama, we are working for political reform that gives democracy stability by making sure that it is always based on service to others. Thanks to the contributions of the expanded Canal, and of an honest Government committed to transparency and the efficient management of public funds, Panama is maintaining its economic growth and making rapid progress towards meeting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nOur Government\u2019s 2014-2019 strategic plan is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and backed by an aggressive public investment plan, totalling $19 billion, designed to provide all Panamanians with access to potable water, basic sanitation, decent housing and efficient, high- quality health, education, security and transport services. With the aim of eradicating poverty and inequality, we have strengthened and expanded the coverage of our social support system programmes, which now reach 20 per cent of the population. In the area of public health, we have completed the first phase of our national dialogue for effective coordination of the health system. We have conducted mass vaccinations following an outbreak of the H1N1 virus in the region, and through our first national census on preventive health we have done free clinical evaluations of more than 80,000 people over the age of 40.\nAs a country, we are making the biggest investment in basic sanitation and mass transit in Latin America, areas that account for about 60 per cent of our budget for 2019. Together with our social housing and training programmes for young people at risk, those projects are transforming our neighbourhoods and communities with a new model for human development, with a vision by the State taking into account social criteria and without partisan political distinctions. In the area of education, in a strategic alliance with the private sector, we are allocating the funds needed to develop an educational model with 100 per cent high school attendance, an extended school day and bilingual education, alongside the construction of new, modern higher technical education institutes that can enable our young people to get the well-paid jobs that our growing service economy is generating.\nWith the support of more than $3 billion in foreign investment in the energy sector, we are diversifying our energy mix with renewable, cleaner types of energy. We have set ourselves the goal of recovering 50 per cent of our deforested areas in the next 20 years and protecting our biodiversity and our oceans. By 2019, we will have built more than 300,000 basic sanitation units in Panamanian homes and housing projects for more than 100,000 families nationwide. We are building 10,000 new classrooms and renovating more than 3,000 public schools across the country. Right now we are making progress in adding another 50 kilometres to our mass transit metro system, which will benefit more than 1.5 million people. Our plan also includes long- term planning for the construction of new hospitals, roads, water treatment plants, aqueducts and sewage and wastewater treatment plants. All these efforts in public investments are being implemented with full fiscal responsibility, an added value of an honest and transparent Government.\nIn addition, we have developed a set of major reforms and exemplary actions aimed at strengthening our democracy and ensuring transparency and accountability within a framework of respect for the separation of powers and the rule of law. With every passing day, our country comes closer to meeting the SDGs. The range of world-class international services that form the basis of our growing economy makes us ever more committed to being responsible citizens of the world. As a serious, responsible country, Panama is willing to comply with the obligations of international law and to cooperate as a regional partner and strategic ally on trade and security issues.\nWith the same determination with which we committed to completing the expansion of the Canal and protecting our logistical services, ports and airports from organized crime, we in Panama have accepted responsibility for upholding our financial system and moving forward with the exchange of tax information. Our Administration has enacted important legal and institutional reforms so that we can adopt top international standards in order to comply with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and related activities. As I told the Assembly last year (see A/70/PV.19), some weeks ago we reaffirmed our commitment to transparent financial systems and fiscal responsibility with our announcement that Panama will become party to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and we are going to do that. We will continue to work with the international community to lead efforts to prevent financial systems from being used for purposes that do not represent the common good.\nIn addressing the serious threats and major challenges that are the purview of the Assembly, we must not forget that relations among States are global. Therefore we cannot allow differences of opinion among two or more countries on a single topic to jeopardize the progress that can be achieved on other bilateral and multilateral issues of common interest and mutual benefit to our peoples.\nThe world witnessed significant progress made at the Paris summit. This week, Panama will deposit the instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Our country is moving aggressively to play its part. With the same resolve and commitment, I call on States Members of the Organization to join forces against climate change, pool their efforts and do everything in their power to find comprehensive solutions to the issue of irregular migration flows, and to continue taking solid steps that will allow us to defeat terrorism and organized crime, inequality and poverty.\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the intensification of terrorist attacks that threaten the peace and security of humankind on a recurring basis. I wish to recognize the men and women fighting terrorism and to express our solidarity with the families of those killed in these attacks. I thank those who are deployed on humanitarian missions around the world, assisting those who flee violence caused by terrorism and armed conflict.\nPanama energetically condemns the recent attack perpetrated against a humanitarian aid convoy in Syria. I take this opportunity to call on the great Powers to maintain their diplomatic channels open and pursue dialogue within the framework of the Security Council in order to achieve peace in Syria and the cessation of other armed conflicts in the world.\nYesterday, we Heads of State had the opportunity to discuss in depth the issue of irregular migration flows in our region, which in our case principally involves Haitian citizens who risk and even lose their lives crossing vast distances, rivers and inaccessible territories en route to northern countries in the hope of a better future. We stress our position that all migration policies and measures must be based on the protection of the inherent human right to life. Convinced that controlled migration contributes to justice and equity in the world, Panama therefore reaffirms its commitment to providing humanitarian treatment for migrants, applying strict health and safety controls. I call on all countries of the hemisphere to endorse the successful completion of the electoral process in Haiti and the strengthening of its democratic institutions and economy.\nThe rapprochement between the Governments of Cuba and the United States is an example of what diplomacy can achieve in order to contribute to the regulation of migration flows, and we expect this new dimension of the foreign policies of both countries to continue developing until the normalization of full diplomatic relations is achieved.\nPanama supports the dialogue that is taking place in Venezuela. We believe that the inclusion of the Holy See as a mediator of the process would be very positive, and we reiterate our position that any end to tensions between the political forces of that brotherly nation must be achieved through democratic means and dialogue in order for social peace and respect for human rights to prevail.\nOn 26 September, we shall accompany the Government of Colombia in the signing of the Final Peace Agreement in that brotherly nation, which we commend and fully support. Our presence at that historic event will not be only to support the Agreement, but also to honour the memory of thousands of members of the Colombian public forces who have died and the thousands of innocent lives lost throughout the conflict.\nWe congratulate the Government of Colombia and President Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n for his determination in the pursuit of peace, and we call on the demobilizing rebel groups to fulfil their obligations, as laid out in the Agreement, in order to consolidate a peace that is so desired and deserved by the Colombian nation. In this context, I acknowledge the Secretariat for its decision to become actively involved in supporting the peace process through to its successful completion.\nDespite this great step forward, the region is threatened by increased drug production and trafficking. Panama will therefore continue to strengthen its capabilities and professionalize its public forces in order to protect our homeland and support the countries of our continent in the front-line fight against drug trafficking. During the 27 months of our Government, we have achieved a significant reduction in crime of more than 40 per cent after having launched a successful security plan to prevent and combat crime in Panama, offering more opportunities for young people at risk and a firm hand against delinquency and organized crime. In accordance with our security strategy, we have managed to seize tons of drugs and dismantle networks linked to organized crime.\nIn the first years of our Government, we reached out to the countries of Asia. With the support of Singapore, we are developing higher technical education in our country, and through the technical assistance and financing of the Government of Japan, Panama will build a 27-kilometer monorail that will benefit hundreds of thousands of Panamanians in the west of our capital city. With Europe, we increased our air connectivity with direct flights to five cities on that continent. With the United States, we have strengthened cooperation in security, and with the countries of our Latin American region we have adopted migration and trade policies that contribute to the development of economic relations and encourage integration.\nTwo months ago, the Holy See and His Holiness Pope Francis acknowledged our country\u2019s commitment to playing an active role in strengthening unity and peace in the world and guiding young people so that they may continue advancing along the path of education, work and progress. Panama has been chosen to host the next World Youth Day in 2019. This event will bring together more than 500,000 young people from 190 countries and will be a great opportunity to sow the seed of peace among young people in Central America, exchanging violence, mourning and pain for peace, faith and hope. This will promote and consolidate family values, security and the common good.\nIn the globalized world in which we live, threatened by armed conflict, terrorism, organized crime and humanitarian crises, responsible countries represented in the Assembly must unite to confront these global threats and strengthen the United Nations system. Our canal has expanded, as have our ports and airports. In this way, Panama is each day more prepared to be the great connection. Yet what is most important for me as President is that the Government I lead should prepare us in such a way that this connection is more than merely logistical, and encompasses values and principles that strengthen governability in all nations and guarantee social peace in the world. My Government is committed to its country and to its people, and my nation is committed to placing its riches, capabilities and geographical position at the service of all the world\u2019s inhabitants. This is Panama \u2014 the route that unites the world.\n"

        "file_text": "As a citizen and the President of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, it is an honour for me to speak to the General Assembly again from this rostrum. In this forum, which is the largest and most representative of humankind today, I offer the greetings of the citizens and the Government of my country. Our greetings reflect the values of peace, freedom, democracy, justice and solidarity, which define our nation and the United Nations, which we helped found in 1945, and today we are a non-permanent member of the Security Council.\nAs this is not my first time here, I run the risk of repeating what I said on previous occasions, and in particular what I said on 29 September 2016 in the General Assembly at its seventieth session (see A/70/ PV.16). But I am taking that risk because, with only a few exceptions, all the issues that I raised a year ago can be conveyed in the same terms and, in some cases, even graver ones.\nLet us be clear: I do not say that as a reproach, and even less so as self-praise. It is painfully obvious, however, that despite the efforts of the United Nations to fight terrorism, violence, intolerance, discrimination, poverty, inequality, injustice and organized crime, these scourges continue to plague much of humankind. For it is our modest belief that the task of Governments and, moreover, of rulers \u2014 that is to say, our task, which has been entrusted to us by our citizens \u2014 cannot be limited to making assessments and telling people what is amiss. Our unconditional duty is to create the conditions for our people to build their own lives in society and to support them in that task. What I am saying does not seem like much, but it is a lot.\nWithout ignoring the enormous importance of other issues under consideration by the Assembly, let me refer to one that perhaps is not in the news, but it is certainly important because, as the data provided by the World Health Organization shows it is the primary cause of mortality throughout the world, especially in low- and middle- income countries. I am mainly talking about non-communicable diseases, in particular cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic pulmonary diseases. Clearly, the consequent terrible impact that these diseases have on humankind fly under the radar of our Governments, but they nevertheless tragically affect the lives of our peoples. And these avoidable diseases are largely due to four risk factors directly linked to supposedly typically modern behaviours, that is, smoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity.\nThe primary effects of those risk factors are dramatically felt increasingly in middle- and low-income countries, and the poorest people in every country, strongly reflecting the underlying socioeconomic determiners. Among these populations, the conditions are ripe for creating a vicious cycle. Poverty exposes people to the behavioural risk factors that lead to non-communicable diseases and these, in turn, tend to worsen the state of poverty of the affected individuals and families. Health systems are also affected by the impact of the high costs of the treatments that are needed to treat chronic non-communicable diseases. To give an idea of the financial implications, and without being dramatic, I want to draw members\u2019 attention to the following statistics, which they certainly already know.\nFirst, the direct cost of smoking on the national health-care systems of Latin America is estimated at $33 billion. That is the equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the gross domestic product of our region and 7 per cent of what it spends annually on health care. And the tax that our countries impose on tobacco products does not amount to 50 per cent of the costs of illnesses directly caused by smoking. Secondly, in 2009 the overall estimated economic cost of cancer in Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America amounted to an estimated $286 billion in direct costs \u2014 for example, doctors\u2019 visits and medical analyses \u2014 and indirect costs, including travel and lodging expenses and lost workdays and productivity, among others. Therefore, in our humble view, unless we vigorously fight the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in countries and social groups that are most exposed or affected, the impact of those diseases will grow. And the plausible global goal of reducing poverty, which is timely and adopted by the Assembly as the condition sine qua non for sustainable development, rather than drawing closer, dramatically, retreats more each day beyond our reach.\nIf we look at the statistics available, in a single working day approximately 104,109 people worldwide will die today as a result of the diseases I mentioned. How then can we not design and implement strategies to control alcohol and tobacco consumption and to promote healthful lifestyles, such as a healthful diet and physical exercise. No doubt what I am saying here is a far cry from what those who preceded me in addressing the Assembly have said. While I hope I am mistaken, if we do not take appropriate measures, our countries, especially the poorest and most humble among them, will suffer dramatic consequences due to those diseases, which, I repeat, can be prevented. Of course, this is not a medical panel or a scientific symposium. But as a political leader who has not forgotten his medical profession and continues to be involved in it, allow me to tell the Assembly that not only is it possible to design and implement such strategies, but that very positive results can be achieved.\nThose are not easy or simply strategies, but they are essential and can yield good results. Uruguayans know this from our own real-life experiences. But more than that, we have in place actual projects that we are working on. As on this issue there is also no future without solidarity, we call upon all countries, Governments and peoples, non-governmental organizations, as well as scientific, medical and international organizations, to form an alliance under the United Nations against the epidemic of non-communicable diseases \u2014 an alliance for a healthy life and as broad, vigorous and dynamic as possible. It is possible \u2014 not easy, but possible. In many ways, more than financial resources, it requires conviction and political will to go ahead.\nUruguay is a world leader in the implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. But there have been opponents to that leadership. Among them, at the beginning of the year 2010, a claim was brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes by the tobacco firm Philip Morris. That company was suing our country because of its opposition to two regulations adopted by our country in order to control tobacco. In addition to the formal arguments brought by that tobacco firm, the main reason for its action was to punish a small country like Uruguay that had decided to control tobacco consumption and to work hard for the health and right to live of our people. The lawsuit was a punishment, using our small country as an example, so that all countries that were implementing or planning to implement similar policies would learn from this lesson not to go forward with them.\nThe proceedings were lenghthy, meandering and costly. In the end, though, on 8 July, the arbitral tribunal of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes handed down its final ruling. It was decisively favourable to Uruguay. None of the claimants\u2019 arguments were accepted and, more important, the policies adopted by our country were recognized as sovereign, legitimate and in line with the international commitments Uruguay had undertaken and in accord with international law. But things do not happen by coincidence. In that regard, I would like to thank the World Health Organization, many of the countries represented here and all the institutions and individuals who in one way or another supported Uruguay\u2019s cause in this dispute. I thank all of them sincerely on behalf of the Uruguayan people. The best way to return such support \u2014 and without being ignorant of the circumstances under which we live today \u2014 we commit ourselves to continue working hard, as our modest means allow \u2014 to help all the people of the world succeed in meaningfully defending their rights to health and life.\nUruguay is not unaware of the circumstances in other regions of the world. Again, we are not indifferent. Allow me to address some of those issues.\nFirst, we would like to congratulate the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. We reiterate to them our willingness and readiness to continue cooperating with the parties in the new and demanding stages of the peace process.\nSecondly, in our address to the General Assembly in 2015 (see A/70/PV.16) we expressed our desire that the seventieth session would be the last at which our country had to call for an end to the economic, trade and financial embargo so unfairly imposed by the United States on Cuba. So long as the embargo remains in place, Uruguay will continue to demand here its definitive lifting.\nThirdly, we are not indifferent to the complex political and institutional situations that exist in several brother nations. As good brothers, we hope that such difficulties will sovereignly resolved on the basis of democratic institutional frameworks and in a calm, respectful and sincere dialogue among the parties involved. The will of citizens, the will of the people, must be thoroughly respected.\nI very much appreciate the attention the Assembly has given to me today. On behalf of the Uruguayan people, a small country in South America\u2019s Southern Cone, I would like to reiterate that, within our modest means, we will continue to work with members to strive for a more fraternal world with more solidarity for more social justice, with peace, with respect and with tolerance for all inhabitants of the planet.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Desir\u00e9 Delano Bouterse, President of the Republic of Suriname, I extend to the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Thomson, congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. His wealth of experience will undoubtedly contribute to the successful discharge of his important duties.\nI would like to pay tribute to outgoing Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his accomplishments in leading the Organization over the past 10 years and for his continuous endeavours to reorganize the United Nations. We especially applaud his efforts to promote sustainable development and his commitment to the betterment of the livelihood of vulnerable groups and to the advancement of women. The Government and the people of the Republic of Suriname wish the Secretary- General much success in his future, new challenges.\nAs we continue our deliberations and take decisions on pertinent issues with respect to the global agenda, the world is facing grave financial, economic,\nenvironmental and political crises. That situation is in contrast to what is needed for the sustainable development of all nations, namely, peace, political stability, democracy and universal access to our planet\u2019s resources.\nAt the same time, we are concerned by the multitude of challenges and threats that the world now faces in the political, security, economic and social realms. They include the global recession and economic slowdown, which have caused decreasing growth and productivity; worsening inequalities that are causing increased violence, political instability and social deterioration; transnational organized crime and terrorism; and digital and technological innovation.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development places human beings at the centre of development. The implementation of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals gives us the opportunity to fight for a just world order in order to achieve peace, equitable power relations in the world, and political and social stability, as well as an equal distribution of wealth and opportunities for all. That would imply that eventually the eradication of poverty and the promotion of economic growth could be attained.\nNevertheless, there is a wide gap between what we promise our peoples in international and regional forums and what is actually achieved. Suriname believes that we must build peaceful and inclusive societies with equal opportunities for all. It is therefore essential that our social and economic order be structurally reformed and that we focus on advancing innovation and new technologies, human knowledge, capacities and skills. That is needed in order ultimately to find a solution that will create opportunities to accumulate knowledge, increase employment and social protection, enhance social inclusion and protect the environment, all of which will eventually lead to sustainable growth and stability.\nIt is not by chance that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also deals with migration, nor is it a coincidence that we have been discussing migration as a top priority of the international community. The movement of people across international borders \u2014 be it as migrants, refugees or asylum-seekers \u2014 continues to be one of the most important issues on the global policy agenda, for it has enormous economic, social and cultural implications. As far as refugees and asylum- seekers are concerned, Suriname holds the view that international norms, values and principles must be upheld and that human rights must be respected.\nSuriname attaches great importance to the principles of international law, under which we have committed both to refrain from unilateral interference in the domestic affairs of other countries and to respect their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is also essential for securing peace, international security and lasting prosperity for all nations, regions and peoples. We believe that the only way to create a culture of peace and justice is through dialogue, consensus-building and negotiated resolutions to conflicts. Long-lasting political stability requires that democracy and democratic principles be respected; democratic traditions must be upheld, and the legitimacy of democratically elected Governments must be recognized for the duration of their tenure.\nA long-standing issue on our international agenda is the struggle of the Palestinian people. Suriname supports the two-State solution for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples in order to attain the political stability needed for their development. In our region of the world, South America, we welcome the historic peace agreement that is to be signed today between the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. It upholds the principles of coexistence, cooperation and respect, and reinforces our hemisphere as a zone of peace, as declared in 2014 during the third Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. We also welcome the ongoing process to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America, which will contribute to further enhancing peace, stability, unity and development in the Americas. We will continue to support the call by the international community to have the United States lift the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba.\nGlobal temperatures and sea levels are rising, ice caps are melting, and greenhouse-gas emissions are not yet diminishing. With a forest cover of well over 90 per cent and a deforestation rate of merely 0.02 per cent, Suriname is one of the few carbon-negative countries in the world. Its relatively small size and population \u2014 a surface area of 163,000 square kilometres and a population of 550,000 \u2014 make it particularly vulnerable to global environmental challenges and external economic shocks. In addition, as a country with a low-lying coastal zone and with the majority of its population and fertile soils at risk from the dangers of rising sea levels, Suriname\u2019s sustainable development efforts are under serious threat.\nNevertheless, we are still prepared to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases and to implementing even more ambitious policies. However, we cannot do that on our own, and we therefore call upon the international community not only to develop technical and financial support mechanisms within existing financial frameworks, but also to make new and additional financing available in order to support developing countries like ours. That will allow us to implement essential adaptation policies and programmes, compensate for losses and damages, develop technology and safeguard food production and food security.\nThe consequences of the global economic slowdown are being felt throughout the world, and Suriname has not been spared. Faced with a drop in the international prices of the commodities that we export, last year we were forced to implement an adjustment and reform programme that has imposed difficult but necessary adjustment measures. In order to ensure that the adjustment runs smoothly and to secure technical assistance for our reform programme, the Government of Suriname signed a stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund early in 2016. In the light of the positive results achieved in a short period of time, we reiterate our intention to continue to work in close collaboration with the Fund, with the goal of securing macroeconomic stability and carrying out the institutional and legal reforms needed to restore economic growth and social stability.\nWe are confident that with international commodity prices on a steady path of recovery and with the grants and soft loans that we have been able to acquire through our friendly bilateral relationships and multilateral partners, as well as through international financial institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank, my country\u2019s development path will be back on track within the next two years.\nWe therefore thank all of those who have offered their assistance in recent years, and we also welcome foreign investors who wish to participate in our future development. Suriname is a country with many natural resources and excellent opportunities for outsourced production processes. We recognize that we will have to exploit our resources commercially if we are to sustain our economic growth, and diversify our economy,\nwhich will include a shift from complete dependence on minerals and developing new sectors, such as agro- industry and tourism.\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, world peace and stability for our nations and peoples, joint and consensual endeavours are required, as well as greater cooperation and dialogue. The relevance of multilateralism has proved to be essential for our coordinated actions. Suriname recognizes the eminent role that the United Nations plays in ensuring lasting development and peace, and we pledge our unwavering commitment to the work of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me congratulate the President on his assumption of his high office to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish to take this opportunity to assure him of our support in the effective discharge of his responsibilities. I would also like to express appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, who steered the work of the historic seventieth session.\nSince the Secretary-General has addressed the Assembly at its general debate for the last time, allow me to express, on behalf of the people and Government of Ethiopia and on my own behalf, sincere appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his tireless service to our Organization over the past decade. We cherish his friendship with Ethiopia and with Africa as a whole, and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavours.\nThe past year has indeed been historic in more ways than one. It has been a time when we have reflected on our journey over the past 70 years and taken decisive steps towards ensuring the peace and prosperity of our peoples and the protection of our environment. We have seen what the United Nations can deliver as a unique intergovernmental platform for a common and collective response to the myriad challenges facing humankind as a whole. It has been testament to the fact that we can indeed achieve concrete results, if we set aside, or at least manage, our differences and act for the common good.\nNow is, of course, the time for action, so that the transformative decisions that we took last year will have real meaning in the lives of our people. We recognize the small but encouraging steps taken towards the implementation of our decisions in many of the domains. For our part, for instance, not only have we integrated the Sustainable Development Goals into our national development plans, but we have also embarked on implementing them. The ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is also a major priority, and we will expedite the process as soon as our Parliament opens its session at the end of this month.\nTo say that the world is currently confronting unprecedented challenges would be an understatement. Without a doubt, there are enormous implications for the implementation of the ambitious and transformative agendas that we set out last year. International peace and stability are facing greater risks with the rise of geopolitical tensions and the growing threats posed by all shades of terrorist groups and other transnational criminal networks. The world economy has not yet come out of its crisis, and growing inequality is creating a lot of frustration, paving the way for the resurgence of populism.\nWhile social media offer a digital platform to improve the exchange of information and enhance popular participation, their attendant negative impacts cannot simply be ignored. In fact, we are seeing how misinformation can easily go viral via social media and mislead many people, especially youth, who are our future. Social media have certainly empowered populists and other extremists to exploit people\u2019s genuine concerns and spread their message of hate and bigotry without any inhibition.\nWe would be the first to admit that countries need to assume ownership of their problems. Externalizing the sources of setbacks and seeking external causes for one\u2019s national shortcomings is an approach to problem- solving whose results can only be pregnant with danger. But it is vital to underline a critical matter that is usually given short shrift, both by the media and others. It is simply hypocritical to deny that some countries have been the targets of destabilization activities carried out without accountability by people and groups that have been given shelter by friendly States. The abuse of opportunities created by the social media and other media outlets financed by friendly Governments has become flagrant. It is just plain foolish to deny that such abuses have no implications for the respect of the human rights of our people or that such abuse does not undermine our capacity to ensure that we maintain a high standard in that respect.\nThe fragile nature of our environment has also been evident. The drought induced by the El Ni\u00f1o- Southern Oscillation has affected the livelihood of millions of people, including our own, all across the world. The current drought is happening at a time when humanitarian needs have become enormous because of other emergency situations. In addition, the large movements of refugees and migrants have led to a major crisis. Such movements are a matter that we have discussed at length over the past few days.\nIt is in such challenging circumstances that we are striving to implement a transformational agenda. Obviously, there are no easy solutions to the complex challenges at hand. The situation is much more pronounced for the least developed countries like us that are making every possible effort to make a dent on poverty. We are trying to escape from the poverty trap and take our country on a path of sustainable growth, but there are bound to be twists and turns in our efforts. The successful development experiences of others have shown that such twists and turns are only natural.\nWhat we need is to have a policy space that allows us to make mistakes and learn from them. We believe that our vision is right, and we are determined to get to our goal. Whatever challenges and shortcomings we may have, we do not have an issue owning up to them, and we will make every possible effort to deal with our shortcomings with the close consultation, cooperation and participation of our people. There is no better testimony of the resolve that we have in that regard than the way in which we have handled the tragedies caused by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation.\nNevertheless, we know that we are not living in isolation, and we need a favourable external environment in order to realize our development aspirations. We cannot simply wish away the challenges that I have outlined. They need the collective and coordinated responses of all of us, and for our part we are always ready and willing to continue to contribute positively in close partnership with others in our region and beyond in tackling such challenges.\nIn that context, peace and security in the Horn of Africa are extremely critical for us, and we are doing everything we can with others in the region to tackle the conflicts afflicting our neighbours. We have been making tremendous efforts to assist South Sudan to resolve its internal problems. What happened in July was indeed a serious setback for the implementation of the peace agreement that the South Sudanese parties had signed under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Plus. We in the IGAD region met on a number of occasions at various levels to address the issue and made concrete proposals on the way forward. The proposals were subsequently supported by the African Union and the United Nations. We are confident and hopeful that the South Sudanese parties will heed the call of the regional and international communities and restore peace for the sake of their people, who have suffered so much.\nIn addition, we have also been making efforts to fight terrorism in and pacify Somalia. In spite of the many challenges that persist, Somalia has indeed come a long way. The symbolic significance of the IGAD extraordinary summit held recently in Mogadishu cannot be overemphasized. Who would have thought that this would be possible only a few years ago? Somalia has defied the odds. We hope that smooth elections in the coming months will consolidate the gains made in recent years and lay the foundation for a peaceful and stable Somalia. The countries in the region are ready to support and accompany the process together with the African Union, the United Nations and other international partners.\nEthiopia is indeed honoured to have been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. Let me take this opportunity to express our profound appreciation to all the Members of the United Nations for their support and confidence.\nI would like to conclude my remarks by reaffirming our commitment to effectively discharging our responsibilities and upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to participate once again in the General Assembly on behalf of the people of the Dominican Republic. I wish to begin my remarks with a special recognition of the work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past 10 years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake.\nThe year 2016 is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identity-related tensions in various parts of the world. We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts \u2014 first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term.\nOne such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for long-term transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone\u2019s reach. It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded. Indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.\nBut we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism. We have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data. We must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind.\nTo begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who were able to do so necessarily remain there. We have, then, a new social segment, a segment that has already been lifted out of poverty, but whose position is much too fragile for us to consider it definitive. The word used to describe the situation of those men and women is \u201cvulnerability\u201d \u2014 vulnerability to unemployment, to the illness of a family member, to an economic crisis or a natural disaster, and vulnerability to a series of unforeseen events that could ruin their prospects for the future and return them to poverty in just a short time.\nThat vulnerable group now includes more than 1.5 billion people around the world, who represent more than 22 per cent of the world\u2019s population, according to United Nations statistics. That population is especially large in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the majority of people earn between $4 and $10 a day. The challenge that we face is to strengthen the position of that emerging class. We must provide them with security and give them the tools and skills enabling them not only to develop their own lives, but also to participate in the development of their countries.\nLet there be no doubt that new social class offers a great opportunity for our nations. Because of its expanded capacity for consumption and its ability to save, that social class has the potential to become, as has already been noted, an economic growth bonus, similar to the so-called demographic boom that our countries have seen as well. To bolster the emerging middle class will require more complex and better- quality products in all sectors, from infrastructure to education. The path of that class to progress will enable our countries and the entire world to progress.\nBut in order to realize all of that potential, we must strengthen the safety nets and social supports in the areas of health, education, employment and social security, so as to keep vulnerable individuals from falling back into poverty. If we take that opportunity, not only can those men and women leave their difficulties behind forever, but they can also convert their countries into middle class, democratic and peaceful societies with less need to emigrate abroad. In other words, they can be the key to far-reaching changes on our continent.\nWithin the framework of the Assembly, the post-2015 development agenda, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its Sustainable Development Goals, provides a good road map for many of the challenges that we face in Latin America, the Caribbean and the world. Our country believes that it is important to work every day to reduce suffering and to develop strategies to ensure that the path out of poverty is a path of no return. However, in order to accomplish those goals, in order to lift people out of poverty \u2014 hundreds of millions of people \u2014 more is needed than merely adopting a series of formulas and indicators.\nProfound changes must urgently be made to the methods by which trade and financial flows are carried out. That is to say, it is necessary to revise the rules of the game between rich countries and poor countries. We are talking about trade. We live in an age of unprecedented trade openness. My country, the Dominican Republic, like many others, has signed free trade agreements with the major economic blocs, which ought to be mutually beneficial \u2014 and in many cases they are. However, if I may say so in all honesty, there are times when the developed countries engage in hypocrisy. After more than half a century in which those countries were protected from everything that other countries were able to produce better, now those countries refuse to reduce protectionism within their borders, whereas under the free trade agreements they require that from their counterparts in developing countries. They want us, the developing countries, to eliminate our protections on industrial goods, but they do not eliminate agricultural subsidies.\nFor the next five years, for example, the United States will provide an average of $97.8 billion annually to support its agricultural sector, and in its multi-year subsidy policy for the period 2014-2020, the European Union will devote \u20ac408 billion to subsidize its agricultural sector. The agricultural protectionism practised by rich countries allows them to influence the market in their favour, while tariffs and trade barriers routinely exclude products from developing countries.\nIn addition, other non-tariff barriers, such as phytosanitary regulations, are not transparent; they also create additional barriers to farmers in developing countries seeking to enter the global market. The developed countries have allowed those market distortions to persist and have continued to make rhetorical statements in favour of free trade. They should, rather, take concrete steps to attain the ideal of genuine free and fair trade.\nRecently, countries such as ours that have signed on to free trade agreements have been forced to revise the terms of our existing agreements because of such protectionist practices that create situations of unequal competition. If the industrialized countries want to be true to their word, they must agree to significantly reduce their protectionism and their subsidies during current trade negotiations and, at the same time, ensure increased funding for rural development.\nJust as we should seek greater fairness in trade, we must also ensure that financial flows serve as partners of development and productivity. For some time now, we have been living in an economy where the financial sector is becoming increasingly important. That is a reality that brings as many opportunities as dangers. We were all able to see, for example, how a purely financial crisis like the one that broke out in the 2008, following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, was able to jeopardize years or decades of development efforts in many of our countries.\nWe have also had the opportunity to confirm how the free movement of capital can be used for the purposes of tax evasion or money-laundering. The Dominican Republic, like many of the countries present in the Assembly today, can only benefit from more stable, predictable and better regulated financial markets. Therefore, this year, we have begun to adopt the anti-money laundering recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America. Those measures include greater supervision of financial institutions, greater transparency of the legal status of persons, ensuring the legitimate ownership of assets, monitoring wire transfers, documenting retention policies, creating a framework for international cooperation and providing mutual legal assistance, among other measures, for making the Dominican banking system safer and more transparent.\nIt is worth noting that news such as the recent European Union ruling ordering the technology company Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in unpaid taxes plainly demonstrates a reality that we have long known, namely, that tax havens do not necessarily exist only in sunny Caribbean countries. Quite the contrary, the great majority are under the jurisdiction of the richest countries. Moreover, contrary to the widespread idea that tax havens are merely places to conceal money, they are primarily platforms from which to conduct financial and trade operations in global capital markets. That is to say, it is not money stowed under the mattress but rather an integral part of the real economy that siphons resources from it and robs States of their prerogative of fiscal sovereignty.\nThe lack of regulation has paved the way for tax evaders and has made the work of tax authorities more complex. It constitutes a major threat to State funding worldwide, which undermines the ability of Governments to meet their enormous responsibilities to their citizens. We therefore applaud any initiatives that promote greater regulation of tax havens. We also know that the regulation of tax havens must be part and parcel of a larger system of effective public regulation and monitoring of financial markets, so that they can serve the real economy and its citizens.\nIt is our responsibility to continue to try to lift millions of people out of poverty, but we must do so by setting education, health, employment and social-security policies that build on past successes and enable us to forge ahead. We will continue to be committed to the global exchange of goods and services, but let us ensure that those exchanges are fair and on a level playing field. We will open the floodgates of investment, thereby multiplying possibilities for production, research and growth, but let us also ensure fairness and transparency so that, in the medium and long term, our investment and growth will be in the service of the vast majority rather than a select few.\nLet us build the necessary consensus to humanize the global economy. Let us bring the openness that we demand in finance to the regulation of migration flows. Let us use the same creativity and enthusiasm that we bring to launching lucrative businesses to finding solutions for those most in need. The millions of people who have recently emerged from poverty are the best proof that great things can be achieved when there is political will. Those millions of men and women are also our best partners and the primary reason to continue our work. We have made great strides, but there is a long road ahead of us. The steps ahead will require boldness and honesty. We must do away with taboos, rethink paradigms and redefine the rules of the game. Our country is committed to substantially reducing inequalities, but not only between the richest and poorest inhabitants of our countries, but also in reshaping the international relations between poor and rich countries.\nLet us sit together for a dialogue based on mutual respect, equality and for the common good, without any privileges. Let us do so convinced that that is the only way that humankind can prevail. The time of zero-sum games is over. It is time for all of us to add value. It is time to form alliances that seek to build and where all allies are equal. The international community can always count on the Dominican Republic to help along that path and to work in the service of the vast majority, who needs us.\n"

        "file_text": "Brazil brings its natural spirit of openness to the United Nations and to the world. We are a country that is built on and by the strength of diversity. We believe in the power of dialogue. We strongly advocate the principles that govern the Organization \u2014 principles that are needed now more than ever before. Today\u2019s world shows signs of uncertainty and instability.\nThe international system is currently experiencing what could be described as an order deficit. Reality has moved ahead faster than our collective ability to address it. From outbreaks of regional conflicts to violent fundamentalism, we face both old and new threats that we have been unable to contain. In view of the refugee crisis and the upsurge in terrorism, we cannot help but be overwhelmed by a sentiment of perplexity or bewilderment. Hotbeds of tension show no signs of fading away. A state of virtual political inaction leads to prolonged wars with no solution. The system\u2019s inability to react to conflicts further worsens cycles of destruction. The social vulnerability of so many in several countries is exploited by narratives of fear and entrenchment.\nThere has been a return to xenophobia, and extreme forms of nationalism are gaining ground. Different expressions of demagoguery bring about serious risks on all continents. Even in the economic arena, the fact is that today\u2019s world lacks standards that can otherwise reduce globalization\u2019s asymmetries. Many have yielded to the easy answer of protectionism. We cannot possibly shy away from such a world. On the contrary, we must join hands and unite to transform it through diplomacy \u2014 balanced but firm diplomacy, sobering but determined. Such diplomacy should be well-grounded and embracing of change. That is how Brazil has conducted diplomacy both within our region and beyond as a country that has pursued its interests without ever relinquishing its principles.\nWhat we wish for the world is what we wish for Brazil \u2014 peace, sustainable development and respect for human rights. Those are the values and aspirations of our society. Those are the values and aspirations that guide us on the international stage. We would like to live in a world in which law prevails over force. We would like to have rules that reflect the pluralistic nature of the community of nations. We would like to have a results-oriented United Nations, capable of facing up to the major challenges of our time. Our debates and negotiations cannot possibly be confined to the Organization\u2019s rooms and halls. Instead, they should reverberate through the markets of Kabul, the streets of Paris and the ruins of Aleppo.\nThe United Nations cannot be reduced to a mere observation post that condemns the world\u2019s scourges. Instead, the Organization should assert itself as a source of effective solutions. Those who sowed the seeds of conflict have reinvented themselves, but multilateral institutions have not. It is for that reason that Brazil has warned that it is essential to make global governance structures more representative, many of which have by now aged and have become disconnected from reality. The Security Council must be reformed. We stand ready to overcome the current impasse surrounding that issue.\nMany challenges go beyond national borders, including trafficking in drugs and weapons, and have an impact on our cities, schools and families. Fighting organized crime requires us to work hand in hand. The very safety of our citizens ultimately depends on the quality of our collective action. An example of this is the war in Syria, which continues to engender unacceptable suffering, with women and children as the main victims. A political solution can no longer be postponed. We call on the parties involved in the conflict to respect the agreements endorsed by the Security Council and to guarantee the civilian population access to humanitarian aid.\nWe are also concerned by the lack of prospects for peace between Israel and Palestine. Brazil continues to support a solution based on two States living in peaceful coexistence within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. It is our common responsibility to give new impetus to the negotiating process.\nAnother reason for concern, if I may say so, is the lack of progress on the nuclear disarmament agenda. There are thousands of nuclear weapons in the world today. That amounts to thousands of threats to international peace and security. The most recent nuclear test in the Korean peninsula is a reminder of the danger that nuclear proliferation poses. Brazil can speak with the authority of a country where the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes is an obligation enshrined in the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil.\nYet not all news is bad. There are well-known examples, which have already been mentioned in today\u2019s meeting, of what can be accomplished through dialogue. We celebrate that diplomacy has prevailed on the Iranian nuclear dossier and encourage full compliance and understanding with the agreements reached. The peace accord between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia allows us to envisage the end of the last armed conflict on our continent. I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos and all Colombians for that achievement. Brazil stands ready to contribute to peace in Colombia. The re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America shows that there are no eternal antagonisms or unbreakable deadlocks. We hope that closer ties will bring progress to the region as a whole, to include the economic and trade arenas. We hope that the re\u2013establishment of relations between Cuba and the United State will be followed by the end of the economic embargo against Cuba.\nThis year, Brazil and Argentina celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials. The Agency is the world\u2019s only binational organization responsible for applying nuclear safeguards. As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has stated, the Agency is an inspiration for regional and global efforts towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. Confidence-building between Brazilians and Argentines in the nuclear arena, as I have just indicated, is part of the inception of our integration experience, and of the foundation of projects like the Southern Common Market. For Brazil, Latin American integration is not only Government policy but the expression of a constitutional principle and a permanent foreign policy priority.\nAs we are all aware, Governments of different political inclinations coexist in our region. That is natural and sound. What is essential is that there be mutual respect and that we agree on basic common objectives, such as economic growth, human rights, social progress, security and freedom for all citizens. Those are the objectives that guide and inform the presence of the United Nations in Haiti. Since 2004, Brazil has led the military component of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and has sent more than 33,000 contingents to that Caribbean country. We trust that the United Nations presence on the ground in Haiti will focus more on developing institutions and capacity-building.\nBrazil\u2019s neighbours also include our brothers and sisters from Africa, to whom we are tied by the Atlantic Ocean and by a long-standing history. This year, we will host the Summit of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. Of the Community\u2019s nine members, six are African States. Brazil therefore looks towards Africa with friendship and respect, with a determination to undertake projects that will unite us even more.\nDevelopment is more than just an objective, it is an imperative. A developed society is one where all are entitled to high-quality public services such as education, health care, transportation and security; one where equal opportunity is assured and where access to decent work opportunities is not a privilege for a few. In a nutshell, development is paramount to dignity, and the dignity of humankind is one of the principles of the Brazilian State, as laid down in article 1 of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the greatest United Nations endeavour in favour of development. Turning it into reality will require more than the sum of national efforts. Supporting developing countries will be crucial to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Prosperity and well- being today should not impair the future of humankind. Economic growth should be socially balanced and environmentally friendly. After all, we live on the same Planet. There is no plan B. We must therefore take ambitious measures under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Tomorrow, I will formally deposit Brazil\u2019s instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change. As the world\u2019s most biodiverse country, and with one of the world\u2019s cleanest energy mixes, Brazil is an environmental powerhouse with an uncompromising commitment to the environment.\nDevelopment also depends on trade. In periods of economic crisis, protectionism often increases. It must be curbed. Protectionism is a perverse barrier to development. It reduces the number of jobs and opportunities and makes men, women and families around the world, including in Brazil, fall victim to unemployment and hopelessness. The multilateral trading system is part of the fight against that evil. Ending protectionism in agriculture is particularly important for development. We cannot keep backtracking on the implementation of World Trade Organization commitments on agriculture any longer. It is urgent to prevent sanitary and phytosanitary measures from serving protectionist purposes. It is urgent to discipline subsidies and other distortive domestic support policies in the agricultural sector. Home to a modern, diversified and competitive agriculture, Brazil contributes to food security. We produce for ourselves and we help to feed the world.\nUnfortunately, the full enjoyment of human rights remains an unaccomplished aspiration in today\u2019s world. Every human being has the right to live freely, according to one\u2019s own beliefs and convictions. Such fundamental liberty, however, is disrespected every day. Persecutions, political detentions and other arbitrary acts remain recurrent in many areas of the world. Our eyes should also turn to minorities and other more vulnerable segments of our society. That is what we have done in Brazil through income-transfer initiatives and housing and education programmes, including financial aid available to students from poor families and backgrounds. We have also advocated gender equality as expressly envisaged in our Constitution. It is incumbent upon us to safeguard the rights of all.\nRefugees and migrants are, more often than not, victims of human rights violations, poverty, war and political repression. Yesterday\u2019s high-level meeting cast light on some of those substantive matters. Brazil is the product of immigrants, men and women from all continents. We repudiate all forms of racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We provide shelter to refugees and migrants, as I underscored in yesterday\u2019s meeting (see A/71/PV.4B).\nIn a world still plagued by hatred and sectarianism, the Rio de Janeiro Olympic and Paralympic games showed that it was possible for nations to come together\n16-29296 9/56 in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In fact, for the first time, a delegation of refugees was able to compete in the games. Therefore, through sports, we can succeed in promoting peace, fighting exclusion and tackling prejudice.\nFinally, I bring to the United Nations a message of uncompromising commitment to democracy. Brazil has just undergone a long and complex process, led by our national congress and supreme court, which ultimately led to an impeachment. I must stress that everything unfolded in full compliance with constitutional order. We offer that example as a clear indication that there can be no democracy without the rule of law with standards that apply equally to all, even the most powerful. That is what Brazil is showing the world through the process of cleansing its own political system.\nWe have an independent judiciary, an active public prosecutor\u2019s office and executive and legislative bodies that fulfil their duties. Individual agendas do not prevail but rather the will of institutions, under the careful oversight of a pluralistic society and a genuinely free press. Our task now consists in resuming economic growth and ensuring that Brazilian workers regain the millions of lost jobs. We are clear on the path to be followed. It is the path of fiscal and social responsibility. Trust has already been restored and a more prosperous horizon lies ahead in the near future. Our development process consists primarily of investment, trade, science, and technology partnerships. In that regard, our relations with countries of all continents will prove decisive.\nI do not wish to close my remarks without addressing the Secretary-General, who will soon be leaving office. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as we all know, has devoted the last 10 years of his life to a tireless pursuit of peace, development and human rights. He can be sure that we are highly appreciative and thankful for his efforts.\nIn the second decade of the twenty-first century, we can no longer doubt that our problems are global. There is no place for isolationism. Ours is a common destiny. At the United Nations, more than anywhere else, we can come close to the universalist ideal that drives us all. About sixty years ago, my fellow countryman, Oswaldo Aranha, stated from this rostrum that even in a world as disturbed as it was then, no one wished to see the doors of the United Nations close. He warned us all that without the United Nations, the shadows of war would descend upon humankind to relentlessly and indefinitely eclipse the hope of so many men and women. It is in the Assembly of nations that we nurture our hope, a hope achieved through dialogue, mutual understanding and respect for others, ourselves, our children and our grandchildren.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I am happy to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. Allow me to wish you great success in your new function and to thank your predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his leadership as President of the General Assembly during the seventieth session. I further wish to commend the stewardship of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban-Ki-moon, and his part in implementing the goals of the Organization.\nThe situation in my country continues to cause concern throughout the world. The people of Libya appreciate the efforts of all those who have helped and continue to help them get through this very difficult period. After the signing of the Libyan Political Agreement following the Libyan Political Dialogue, which lasted nearly two years, a solution to political disagreements was reached. It established State institutions and the next step to be taken. The agreement is based on the separation of powers. Henceforth, we will spare no effort to implement all the initiatives and peaceful solutions in order to resolve the disagreements.\nEvery attempt to bring opinions of the various parties closer together \u2014 including the ministerial meeting comprising 20 States held this morning \u2014 illustrates once again that a political agreement is the only viable solution. We call for follow-up efforts to continue the democratic process and establish stable institutions, so that we can realize the aspirations of the Libyan people, who have been waiting for this outcome since February 2011.\nAll of us would like to thank neighbouring countries, friendly countries, the League of Arab States, the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations for their support during this difficult time. Despite the fragile situation of my country, the Presidency Council of the Government of National Accord of Libya is sparing no effort to mitigate the suffering of the Libyan people and to create security and stability and ensure national reconciliation.\nIn order to establish the rule of law and its institutions, it is necessary to find the necessary financial resources in order to reach our goals. We therefore urge all States in possession of Libyan financial assets to facilitate the release of such assets in order to enable the Government to implement its policies.\nWe reiterate our commitment to strengthening the bonds of friendship and the cooperative relations with our brotherly and friendly States in order to achieve our common objectives. In that regard, we call for the return of diplomatic missions to Tripoli so that they can resume their work, and so that we can discuss and coordinate with them directly in implementing joint programmes and overcoming any corresponding difficulties. We understand the concern over security issues, but we are deeply committed to establishing and implementing programmes that will ensure our country\u2019s security.\nMy country reaffirms its unconditional condemnation and rejection of terrorism, whatever the manifestations, origin and motives. Terrorism is a global phenomenon that cannot be linked to any particular religion or belief. As we know, terrorist groups such as Da\u2019esh are coming to our country from abroad. They are not only threatening the peace and stability of my country but are bent on exploiting our national resources, so that they can use them to reach other States in the region, Africa, Europe and the rest of the world to satisfy their lust for blood \u2014 which has no connection to Islam.\nAll States must therefore consolidate their efforts to eradicate terrorism, which targets innocent victims and creates economic and social instability, preventing their peoples from achieving their economic and development objectives. Despite our limited resources, we are waging a relentless war to eradicate terrorism. All States have witnessed the courage of our armed forces, the Libyan National Army, and our loyal and brave young men. As demonstrated by the war in which our finest died as martyrs defending our country, our unity enables us to confront any enemy, no matter how perfidious. In that regard, we hope that all States, in particular the members of the Security Council, will lift the arms embargo. And we call for the convening of an international high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations, so that we can consolidate our efforts to fight terrorism.\nWith respect to human rights, since 2011 legislators in Libya have adopted a series of laws and decisions aimed at strengthening human rights. The Government of National Accord has reaffirmed its commitment to bolstering and protecting human rights. Nevertheless, difficulties arising out of the current transition period have caused a number of security challenges, which have led to several human rights violations. We hope that our efforts to enforce our laws will be supported by the international community. For our part, we will continue to fight impunity and put an end to all practices that lead to human rights violations. We reaffirm our need to receive technical assistance through mechanisms established by the Human Rights Council.\nThe flow of migrants is one of the main challenges facing us, with many of them crossing the Mediterranean in the hope of reaching Europe. The situation has had serious economic, social and security repercussions in Libya. It pains us to note that civil wars are the cause of this situation, which has led to the deaths of many innocent people on our beaches. Worse still, terrorist organizations have benefited from this situation in order to enable their members to head towards numerous countries across the globe. We welcome the regional and international efforts made in compliance with the principles of respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries and designed to put an end to this phenomenon. We reaffirm that we favour a security-based approach. The appropriate solution will address the underlying causes of this dangerous migration.\nWe must all assist the countries of origin by implementing worthwhile development projects with a view to ending poverty and unemployment. We believe that in order to achieve this, the countries of origin, transit and destination must develop and implement strategies for cooperation, with the support of the African Union and the European Union and the encouragement of the international community.\nMotivated by its commitment to peace and international security, Libya is participating in international disarmament efforts, especially with respect to weapons of mass destruction. My country, after joining the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, announced that it had reserves of chemical products, which it has now disposed of with the help of inspectors from the organization. We therefore welcome Security Council resolution 2298 (2016), which is designed to support Libya in ensuring the transfer of the remainder of its category 2 chemical weapons. In this endeavour, we commend the help of Denmark and Germany and thank those two countries.\nLast year we adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 an ambitious agenda for making economic, social and environmental progress by 2030. The High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and its outcome have strengthened our desire to achieve these Goals, upon which we have all agreed. However, words must become actions, and that must be done in an organized and effective way so that we can address the challenges of both today and tomorrow. This means that we are all responsible for supporting poorer countries in their policies and development, particularly those that depend on a single product for their financial resources. We must support them in diversifying their sources of income and in ensuring that their economic institutions reach the necessary level of competence. We must create an environment that is conducive to business.\nThere is a collective conviction of the need to reform the United Nations, especially the Security Council. The Council in its current form no longer reflects the contemporary realities of the twenty-first century, nor is it capable of addressing all the challenges that threaten international peace and security. We therefore call for a permanent seat on the Security Council, with all the corresponding privileges, to be accorded to the Arab States. In addition, we support the final communiqu\u00e9 of the 2010 Arab Summit in Sirte, and reaffirm the C African position, set out in the Sirte Declaration of 2005, calling for two permanent seats with all corresponding privileges, including the veto. Satisfying this African demand would rectify a history of injustice and exclusion.\nPeace in the Middle East will not be possible so long as Israel continues to occupy Palestinian territories, establishing settlements and Judaizing the city of Jerusalem. Israel continues to flout the resolutions of the international community on the rights of the Palestinian people, particularly their right to create an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. We once again demand that the blockade against the Palestinians be lifted. We call for the protection of the Palestinian people and for the occupying authorities to be obligated to cease all violent actions and all their settlement activities throughout Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem.\nThe people of Yemen and Syria \u2014 our brothers and sisters \u2014 have been living for five years now in catastrophic humanitarian conditions owing to the bloody conflicts and their tragic repercussions, which have led to the displacement of innocent citizens. We welcome all efforts to achieve a peaceful solution that will avoid the division and dismantling of these countries and instead fulfil the aspirations of these peoples.\nIn the light of the responsibility that I have agreed to assume, I wish to conclude by taking this opportunity to affirm my resolve to launch a comprehensive project for national reconciliation for all Libyans \u2014 those who live abroad and those who remain in Libya, both in the cities and the countryside, whatever their origin and background, and whatever their political beliefs and intellectual affiliation. I call for reconciliation with those who believe in the establishment of a strong State and a unified army that will defend us from all aggressors. I call for a State that enjoys true sovereignty, where no citizen will be harmed in any way. I call for transitional justice in order to maintain our rights. Libyans, there has been enough destruction and enough bloodshed; let us unite for justice, prosperity and security; let us move towards reconciliation.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, I stood here to assure the General Assembly that isolationism will never be Europe\u2019s policy (see A/71/PV.16). I have not changed my mind, even though the past 12 months have been difficult, not least for the European Union (EU). Europe will always stand for a free and open world governed by the rule of law, in which nations can trade and grow together, instead of living in conflict, mistrust and intrigue. We treat the values upon which the European Union is founded in all seriousness and we have the determination to seek those values in the international arena. If we fail, the world will descend into greater disorder, and the first victims are always the weakest and the poorest.\nThis Organization is in the process of choosing new leadership. That gives us an opportunity to reflect frankly on the kind of international system that we have today and the one that we want for the future. As a historian, I know why the League of Nations failed in its mission to protect peace and international security. It was paralysed by inertia, fatalism and, finally, by cowardice. As a politician, I can see similar phenomena everywhere today. That is owing to the rise of fear \u2014 the fear of war, terrorism and strangers. Globalization makes fear more contagious and more potent. It dangerously links together the anxieties of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe and America. One example, among others, is that of the radical Islam of Da\u2019esh, which spreads terror from Jakarta to Nice, from Tunis to Brussels, from Sirte to Orlando.\nWhen fear takes over, nations increasingly turn away from one another. What we need to do here and now is regain a sense of security, which is a fundamental need for every human being, as important as the need for freedom. No challenge shows that as clearly as the issue of refugee protection and the mass displacement of persons across borders. Over the past several months,\nEurope has been confronted by the refugee crisis to a particularly large degree. Nevertheless, in all our actions aimed at solving the problem of refugees, the European Union is driven by empathy and the readiness to offer help to those in need, even if the world turns its back and pretends not to see. And still today, when we restore order on our external borders and take back control from the smugglers, the readiness to assist refugees in their plight remains our top priority.\nThat is why we have spent billions of euros to fund humanitarian assistance and are willing to spend much more in the months and years to come. It is our hope and expectation that global solidarity will now kick in to provide health, education and jobs for millions of people currently displaced and scale up resettlement. In the light of that, we support the work that has now begun under the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) to find a sustainable and fair rule book for global migration. The Declaration gives us hope that the principles that have been at the heart of our response will also form the foundation of the global response to the refugee crisis.\nEurope is and will be active everywhere that war is imminent or is already raging. Our main goal will always be peace. That as true for civil wars in the Middle East or Africa as it is for nuclear testing and territorial disputes in Asia. It is also true on our own borders on which Ukraine has been attacked by Russia. Further afield, what now concerns us are the conflicts in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, in which the very statehood of those countries is in danger. We fully support and stand ready to engage in the work of the United Nations to bring parties to the negotiating table in Syria and in Libya. And in a few weeks, together with the Afghan Government, the European Union will host an international conference in Brussels. It is a unique opportunity for the rest of the world to show that it cares about supporting a stable Afghanistan and the stability of the region as a whole.\nThis year, we have also witnessed a rising wave of terror worldwide, including against the people of Europe, carried out by many terrorist organizations, in particular by Da\u2019esh. Building a global strategy and network against terrorism is key, including in preventing radicalization and confronting the issues of foreign fighters and terrorist financing. Europe is working with partners from Asia to the Gulf and the Sahel on building up global capacities against violent extremism. We are upgrading our borders to ensure that terrorists cannot pass or re-enter and are working with communities to prevent young people from becoming infected with hatred. This threat will touch all of us sooner or later, which is why we should make better use of the United Nations to fight it together.\nThe European Union is the world\u2019s largest donor of development and humanitarian aid, and that will not change. The Sustainable Development Goals can drive reform of the international system by offering an opportunity to address many problems in one process \u2014 insecurity, poverty, underdevelopment, climate change and uncontrolled migration. And, ultimately, we seek a system that ensures that everybody gets his or her fair share of the benefits of globalization.\nLastly, I would like to say a word about the fight against climate change, to which the EU is fully committed. Europe has had a comprehensive climate-change policy in place for years. Right now we are developing laws that will allow us to reach our ambitious target for 2030, and our ratification of the Paris accord will be completed soon. The fact that the two biggest global emitters have ratified the agreement early is a positive sign. It shows that the readiness to take responsibility for our common future is not limited only to Europe. I am hopeful that this trend will become contagious.\nLet me say one more thing at the end: I feel that ordinary people sense that a great change is coming. We should listen. We should understand. We should anticipate, not just react. Our job is to bring back a sense of direction, to bring back confidence, to bring back a sense of order. Globalization needs credible rules to make it stable and fair, whether we are talking about trade, migration or security.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., the President of the Republic of Palau, I have the honour to make the following remarks at the seventy-first session of the General Assembly.\nAt the outset, Palau would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to lead our work at the seventy-first session. We are confident that he will rise to the many challenges and make the Pacific islands proud. We pledge him our support. We also wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his sterling leadership during the past year. His presidency will be known for championing participation and transparency.\nWe join other Pacific nations in extending our heartiest congratulations to Fiji on bringing home to the Pacific islands from Rio de Janeiro the first-ever Olympic gold medal. We would also like to take this opportunity to commend and thank the people of Brazil for successfully hosting the thirty-first Olympiad. Palau believes in the power of sport as an important enabler of sustainable development, and we contributed to the idea of sport being included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as expressed in paragraph 37 of that document. The power of sport to uplift the human spirit was demonstrated when a team composed of refugees was allowed to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio. We congratulate the refugee team, Brazil and sport for walking the talk about inclusiveness.\nA year ago, as we began our address to the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.28), we stated that we lived in perilously challenging yet still hopeful times. As we meet today, the perils of climate change and global conflicts still exist. Other challenges, such as those posed by the flow of migrants and refugees, as well as by terrorism and violent extremism, have become more prominent, bringing with them psychosocial damage and despair. Addressing antimicrobial resistance and nuclear testing issues have also become matters of urgency.\nAmid those challenges we still have bases for holding onto hope. The high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, held recently, gave us an opportunity to explore ways to address the issue, and we eagerly await the report from that meeting.\nWe commend Ambassador G\u00f3mez Camacho of Mexico for his excellent work on the Political Declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on antimicrobial resistance (resolution 71/3). We trust that the Declaration will galvanize much-needed action throughout United Nations agencies and on the ground in all States Members of the United Nations.\nPalau joins the family of nations condemning the nuclear testing conducted by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We are concerned with the peace and long-term stability of the Pacific region. The proximity of Palau to the launching site places us at particular risk. In addition, we call on Member States that have not yet ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to do so in order for us to move one step closer to total nuclear disarmament.\nThe impact of climate change in terms of sea- level rise, ocean acidification and the frequency and intensity of storms continues to pose an existential threat to Palau and other small island developing States. Palau participated actively in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change processes and was one of the countries that strongly advocated for making Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) a stand-alone goal on climate change. Palau is proud to have been the second, following Fiji, of the 60 nations to have ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, bringing the total number of ratifications to approximately 48 per cent of the membership, with 55 per cent of Member States required for the Agreement to enter into force. We are encouraged by the 130 nations that have signed the Agreement and are confident that by end of the year the Agreement will begin to work for all of us.\nIn addition, we are hopeful that a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for climate change and security will be appointed. Such an appointment will provide an effective working link between the Secretary-General, the General Assembly and the Security Council on matters dealing with peace and security arising from climate change.\nIt is imperative that no effort be spared to ensure that global temperature rise remains under 1.5\u00b0C. Furthermore, access to financial and technological resources must be made available to small island developing States and all those who need it most.\nFourteen years is a short period within which to achieve the 17 goals of 2030 Agenda, which is why we agree with the sense of urgency expressed in the word \u201cpush\u201d in the theme for the seventy-first session of the United Nations: \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. There is an urgent need to transform our world in the face of severe climate change impacts, global conflicts resulting in the unprecedented migration of refugees and poverty exacerbated by huge gaps in resource use and ownership. There is a need to push \u2014 either to jump-start or go further than we have gone already. A push is indeed necessary as we have already lost a year of implementation.\nIn Palau we are in the process of integrating the 17 Goals into our national and sectoral plans so that we can implement the 2030 Agenda in a holistic manner. As part of that effort, we have taken an initiative that for us represents a concrete path towards achievement of the SDGs: the National Marine Sanctuary, which we began to implement in 2015.\nThe National Marine Sanctuary sets aside as a no-take zone 80 per cent of our total exclusive economic zone \u2014 an area of over half a million square kilometres of our ocean. The Palau National Marine Sanctuary is an initiative based on a traditional practice of conservation called Bul, which imposes a moratorium on the exploitation of diminishing resources in order to allow them to replenish themselves. The National Marine Sanctuary will therefore allow our ocean to regain its health, replenish its fish stocks and make progress in the rejuvenation of the biodiversity within it. By strengthening the ocean-based activities of diving, snorkeling, kayaking, swimming and catch-and-release sport fishing, the Sanctuary will boost Palau tourism, which is the main engine of our economy. More important, it will allow us to pass on a healthy ocean and its heritage to our children and the generations to follow.\nIn addition to facilitating the achievement of Goals 13 and 14, the increased income from tourism will allow us to provide basic services, such water and sanitation, and to ensure food security. It will allow us to address the other Goals, including the eradication of extreme poverty, the improvement of health, including addressing the predominance of non-communicable diseases, the strengthening of education, building stronger community resilience and improved information and communication technology to facilitate stronger and more effective disaster resilience. We will also be able to address the special needs of children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, including those with mental illnesses. One of the important outcomes we want from the 2030 Agenda is the promotion of the mental health and well-being for all citizens of Palau.\nThe success of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary will depend to a great extent upon what happens in the areas beyond national jurisdiction, since fish stocks and the health of biodiversity do not have specific boundaries. Palau is therefore grateful that, in accordance with resolution 69/292, a new implementing agreement is under consideration through Preparatory Committee negotiations designed to come up with a comprehensive global regime to better address the conservation and sustainable use of the marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. We are hopeful that the two Preparatory Committees will continue to make positive progress towards a strong implementing agreement. It would contribute greatly to the successful achievement of the objectives of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary.\nGenuine and durable partnerships are also critical to the success of the Sanctuary initiative. Conducting the monitoring and surveillance of such a vast area is very challenging when we are so constrained in our financial, technological and human resources. This underpins the importance of Goal 17 and the significance of genuine and durable partnerships so strongly advocated for in the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action, also known as the Samoa Pathway. In that context, we also wish to recommend that all of us consider partnering with God in our work: He is the only faithful, genuine and durable partner.\nPalau has been fortunate to have many friends and development partners that have assisted us in our National Marine Sanctuary initiative, our renewable energy efforts and our sustainable development activities. In that regard, we wish to acknowledge with gratitude the strong partnerships that we have enjoyed with the United States of America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Italy, India and Taiwan. We are especially grateful for the assistance they have already given us for the Marine Sanctuary, on climate change and in other areas of development.\nThe Republic of China \u2014 Taiwan \u2014 provided assistance that helped us to achieve our Millennium Development Goals, and we look forward to continued support from it towards our achievement of the 2030 Agenda. We urge the United Nations system to involve Taiwan in the processes for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We will need all the resources we can garner, and it will require the participation of every global citizen to have the push we need to be successful. The mantra \u201cno one left behind\u201d must refer not only to benefits, but also to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Agenda was universal in its development and is universal in its transformational goals. It must also be universal in its implementation. Finally, Taiwan possesses technical capacity in many areas which can be shared with the world. It should therefore participate in international meetings, mechanisms and frameworks, such as the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and various economic partnerships, inter alia.\nWhen we talk about participating in and benefiting from the 2030 Agenda, we think of enablers of achievement. Accordingly, in addition to applauding the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, we would advocate for lifting the embargo so Cuba can have the resources it requires to meet its developmental goals. In addition, we join others in advocating for an amenable resolution to the problem in West Papua through meaningful and constructive dialogue.\nBefore I conclude, I would be remiss if I did not express, on behalf of Palau, our profound appreciation for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. He is the first Secretary-General to visit the Pacific, and he never wavered in his desire to ensure that the existential threats to the most vulnerable small island developing States were addressed. Under his stewardship, among other things, we achieved the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We wish him and his family well in their future endeavours.\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon often said,\n\u201cWe are the first generation that can end poverty and the last that can end climate change.\u201d\nWe agree and salute him for the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement, which, if implemented effectively, will help end poverty and climate change, respectively. Our resolve to leave no one behind should be about those who need help and about those who can offer help. Addressing climate change and achieving the 2030 Agenda requires political will, resolve, commitment of resources and goodwill. There is no room for political barriers.\nI am reminded of what the Secretary-General said in his statement at the opening of the seventy- first session of the General Assembly. On the topic of barriers, he said,\n\u201cFar too often, I have seen widely supported proposals blocked ... by a few or sometimes even just one country ... Time and again, I have seen essential action and good ideas blocked ...\n\u201cIs it fair, in this complicated twenty-first century, for any one country, or a few countries, to yield such disproportionate power and hold the world hostage on so many important issues?\n\u201cThe global public is right to ask whether this is how an Organization in which we have invested so much hope and so many aspirations should function\u201d. (A/71/PV.8, pp. 3-4).\nIn that vein, Palau supports Security Council reform, including expansion of the permanent membership to include two seats for Africa and one seat for small island developing States. Our generation will either rise to meet the challenges or be condemned to face regrets from future generations. We can make the choice. Palau has shown the choice it has already made.\n"

        "file_text": "As Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji assumes the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, I wish to recognize that historic occasion for Pacific islanders, and express my congratulations to him and his country. I would also like to thank outgoing President Mogens Lykketoft for his leadership during the General Assembly at its seventieth session, during which I made my first appearance here at the United Nations. At that time, I said that holding on to the podium gave me a sense of security and hope that all of us were thinking in the same direction (see A/70/PV.22).\nAfter 10 years of service, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon deserves great praise for his effective leadership, during which he championed many issues important to small island developing States, including generating the political momentum needed to address climate change and his push to catalyse the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. Sadly, the funds, generously contributed, have been slow in flowing to needy States, thereby contributing to painful delays in the implementation of mitigation and adaptation projects.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia today celebrates its twenty-fifth year of membership in the Organization. At the time we joined, following the end of the Cold War, there was a great sense of optimism that the long-standing obstacles to world peace and progress had been relegated to the past. Today, while there has been progress towards the great goals of the Organization, it must be said without hesitation that much remains to be done.\nThe reform of our United Nations, most important that of the Security Council, has remained on the agenda now for a quarter of a century, which evokes characteristics of an era that needs forgetting. Twenty- five years ago, the small island developing States cried out for action against human-induced climate change, while stressing that we literally faced extinction as nations and as oceanic cultures, owing to surging sea levels and the related consequences. I must concede that our voices have not been entirely unheard. We stand today, at last, many nations united to confront this dark, glaring reality. However, even in the relatively short span of 25 years the relentless advance of climate change has outpaced our efforts to deal with it \u2014 so that today, while all countries must consider themselves vulnerable, the small island developing States are dealing with an already clear and present danger \u2014 the adverse impact of climate change.\nOver the years of my country\u2019s membership in this union of hope, we have observed what I would refer to as glacial progress, were it not for the fact that the glaciers themselves are now melting. Nevertheless, we, along with everyone in this Hall, must remain committed to the great mandates that we so boldly assigned ourselves: the eradication of poverty, the advancement of international peace and security, universal adherence to human rights principles, the protection of our oceans and their resources, and better stewardship of our entire planet.\nThe list goes on, and it is familiar to all of us. We read it out each year at the general debate and in conference halls around the world. Yet, despite our proclamations and declarations, we seem to be pivoting not too far from where we started. Our peoples look to us for progress beyond repetitive words.\nOn the issue of international refugees, Pacific Islanders live in a zone that emanates peace, and it pains us that the global menace of terrorism continues to spread worldwide. It seems that we are helpless to stop the tide of fear and violence \u2014 fear that affects millions of innocent civilians, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, to the point that they must suppress their human dignity and knock on a stranger\u2019s door to seek shelter from the turmoil of war. The question is, will we answer?\nAs small island countries in the Pacific and as members of this family of nations, we plead with the Security Council to take greater action and respond to that global crisis, if not for the mothers and fathers, then at least for the children, whose innocence allows them to play between tents and be happy at the sight of strange food in a bowl.\nWe would like to know what is happening with the ceasefire in Syria. Even from the Pacific, we have an interest in that question. What are the United States and Russia doing about it? What is Syria doing about it? We know they have the power to do more, and we ask them to please do so.\nOn the issue of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, which is part of the Asia-Pacific region, the Federated States of Micronesia is concerned about the peace and long-term stability of the region. Together with other nations, the Federated States of Micronesia condemns the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s ongoing provocative actions and rhetoric. Unchecked, the Pacific Ocean, the same ocean that we speak of saving for all our sakes, may become a battleground. One truly wonders why Beijing and Moscow seem unconcerned that a missile could stray their way. I ask them to please intercede on behalf of all of us. On that note, the people of Micronesia look forward to the day when nuclear weapons will become a thing of the past, remembered only with great disdain and regret.\nOn the issue of Security Council reform, I have heard the phrase \u201cfit for purpose\u201d often used at the United Nations. We continue to see the need for a reformed United Nations that is not only fit for purpose, but also dynamic, changing its modus operandi to keep in step with changing world circumstances, accepting new methods like Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s example of a smartphone on the first day of the general debate (see A/71/PV.8), and needing to move in pace with changes. The United Nations must be able to focus on preventive diplomacy around the world and not be limited to dealing with hot spots. I totally agree with that position. And yes, the United Nations must be a catalyst for peace \u2014 a peacekeeper, more than a peacemaker. The Security Council, entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, must adapt to modern times and reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. However, as an arm of the United Nations, the Council can be credible and effective only if properly empowered and adequately supported by Member States. In that regard, the Federated States of Micronesia reiterates its support for the Group of Four countries being made permanent members of the Council.\nIt is interesting how we stand at this rostrum and talk about disabilities. In that regard, I have noticed that many of us leaders who come up here to speak also seem to have disabilities. We are colour-blind, unable to see the difference between green and red. I apologize for that, and I will try to be brief.\nThe Group of Asia and the Pacific Small Island Developing States has long advocated for climate and security to become a regular focus of the Security Council. The Group also submitted a proposal on the subject to the World Humanitarian Summit, calling for a special representative in the United Nations system to be dedicated to the issue of climate and security. Momentum appears to be on our side, and we hope that the Secretary-General, while he is still with us, will appoint such a special representative, adding to his legacy as a champion of climate change.\nThe selection of a new Secretary-General should involve the whole membership. That would help to ensure that the new head of the Organization has the political support of all Members and is responsive, responsible and effective on behalf of all, not just select, elite, nations.\nOn sustainable development, the work of the United Nations rests on three pillars: peace and security, development and human rights. This is the first year of implementation after the international community adopted a number of milestone agreements in 2015 \u2014 on disaster-risk reduction, financing for development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nFrom the High-level Political Forum exercise held in July, we learned that integrating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our national plans will be daunting, and that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. Presenting a true picture of our national circumstances should not be a burden on small island developing States. In addition, the United Nations should consider the statistics for countries with fewer than 100,000 people, so as to ensure an inclusive process and so that truly no one is left behind. Many of the challenges before the United Nations can be addressed only through the collective work of its membership. Support and partnerships are recognized as essential to making the SDGs universal and transformative for lives on the ground, and national ownership is critical.\nOn the issue of fisheries and oceans, while we may be known as Pacific small island developing States here at the United Nations, there is another term that we often use, which is \u201cbig ocean States\u201d. The Federated States of Micronesia alone has 607 islands, spread across 3 million square kilometres of the Pacific. We are custodians of some of the world\u2019s richest biodiversity and marine resources, and have pledged to conserve 30 per cent of our near-shore marine areas under the Micronesia Challenge, a regional effort to preserve the natural resources that are crucial to the survival of Pacific traditions, cultures and livelihoods. Our conservation efforts directly benefit my country\u2019s sustainable use of its ocean fisheries.\nSpeaking of cultural preservation, I would like to thank UNESCO for its recent designation of our ancient ruins of Nan Madol as a UNESCO World Heritage site, a feat of construction that truly matches, if not surpasses, the wonders of the Egyptian Pyramids. As for climate change, the United Nations remains the last and best hope for galvanizing the necessary political will and commitment for advancing our global agenda on climate change. From this rostrum and elsewhere, leaders from small island developing States, like many others, have called upon the States Members of our Organization, especially world leaders, to step up and take charge by calling for the urgently needed mitigation and financing initiatives to implement climate-change agreements.\nCurrent Government commitments fall considerably short of even reaching the 2\u00b0C goal that we agreed to in Paris. The recent ratification of the Paris Agreement by more than 30 countries, including virtually all Pacific island countries, raises our hopes and expectations that others will soon follow suit.\nOn the issue of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, standing here one year ago, I described the Federated States of Micronesia\u2019s long-standing efforts to amend the Protocol to phase down hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) use, and I thanked new supporters and noted that the proposals were finally bearing fruit (see A/70/PV.22). HFCs are the fastest- growing greenhouse gases in the world. They are also extremely potent, producing warming effects hundreds to thousands of times greater than those of carbon dioxide per ton. Phasing down HFCs will help prevent warming emissions equivalent to almost 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050. Thanks to the many countries that have supported the phase-out proposal, as set forth in the Montreal Protocol, that crusade has gained new momentum.\nLike others, I welcome the progress in the diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. My country, too, has established diplomatic relations with Cuba, but even if we had not entered into that relationship for sovereign recognition and partnership, we, the Federated States of Micronesia, a State Member of the United Nations, would still lend our strong support to resolution 70/120. We ask the United States to accelerate its consideration of and process towards lifting the embargo imposed on Cuba. Along the same lines, I applaud the peace accord reached among the people of Colombia. There may be sceptics as to the truce\u2019s viability, but let us give peace a chance by applauding the great effort and praying for its success. \u00a1Viva Colombia!\nEvery year, before coming to the General Assembly, the Pacific Islands Forum meets to review and recommend our positions on issues worthy of bringing before the Assembly. Earlier this month, Heads of State and Government convened for the forty-seventh annual meeting of the Forum in Micronesia. At that meeting, French Polynesia and New Caledonia were seated as full members of the Forum, while the Federated States of Micronesia became a member of the small island States. Climate change, oceans, health and human rights and partnership featured prominently on our agenda. On climate change, the Forum reaffirmed its position that achieving the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C degrees above pre-industrial levels is an existential matter for many Forum members, and that it must be addressed with paramount urgency. The Forum also observed that the Paris Agreement must be brought into force before the end of 2016, or as soon as possible, even tomorrow.\nOn oceans, the Forum reaffirmed that the Pacific region\u2019s most important natural resource is our ocean. To that end, the Forum leaders endorsed the Pohnpei Oceans Statement: A Course to Sustainability. In the Statement, the Forum reaffirmed that the ocean is the basis for the livelihoods of Pacific peoples, and further noted the valuable opportunity presented by the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Statement further urges the timely and comprehensive conclusion of the Preparatory Committee process, established to make substantive recommendations to the General Assembly on the elements of a draft text of an international, legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nOn fisheries, the Forum called for action to end illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and associated activities, including high-seas bunkering, human trafficking, and illicit trade. The Forum further urged flag States to exercise more diligent efforts in carrying out their flag-State responsibilities and maintaining control of their nationals.\nOur faith in the Organization rests not on the hope that its goals can be reached within a certain time frame, whether it be 25 years or 71 years. Rather, it rests on our confidence that nothing is impossible among like-minded nations willing to unite in sustained efforts. In that regard, this Organization, the greatest convocation ever devised by man, will continue to light our way and that of future generations.\nI will end my remarks with a quotation. Right after the First World War, President Wilson wanted to see the creation of an organization that would prevent all future wars. In that regard, he said,\n\u201cA general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small States alike.\u201d\nAn evident principle ran through the whole programme, namely, the principle of justice for all peoples and nationalities and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another \u2014 whether they be strong or weak.\n"

        "file_text": "I greet the General Assembly on behalf of myself, my country and my nation with the utmost respect. I hope the seventy- first session of the General Assembly will succeed in its purposes and will lead to favourable results for all countries and nations.\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and I thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his work during his presidency during the previous session, while wishing him luck in his future endeavours.\nI would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his valuable contributions as he ends his 10- year tenure as Secretary-General, during which he served in a time of global challenges.\nWithin the first quarter of the twenty-first century, humankind has reached a peak in achievements in science, technology, economic development and health. However, such brilliance has also a very dark and disgraceful side. In Syria, in Iraq and in many countries suffering in the grip of terrorism and war, hundreds of thousands of women and children, the young and the elderly, are being killed. Refugees fleeing death, tyranny and oppression are, unfortunately, also facing degrading treatment in many European cities.\nTerrorist organizations, such as Da\u2019esh and the Al-Nusra Front and the Democratic Union Party and Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, continue their attacks and actions in the region. There is also great potential for the disputes in the Caucasus region to unfold into a full-fledged conflict. Many problems, from Yemen to Ukraine, are of particular urgency, while peoples in countries throughout the world struggle with hunger, epidemics, poverty and illiteracy.\nThat is the disgraceful side of our world, damaging human dignity and disturbing the human conscience. What is even more distressing is that many of those crises and problems could easily be resolved. Peace, prosperity and security for future generations greatly depend on the steps and measures that we take today. Now is the moment to show leadership with a sense of responsibility in addressing the problems before us decisively.\nToday, terrorist organizations are able to employ a variety of methods. On the night of 15 July, we in Turkey suffered a malicious coup attempt initiated by the Fethullah terrorist organization, also know as Fethull. That terrorist organization murdered 241 citizens and injured 2,194 people. Our Parliament building, the presidential complex and many security organizations and law-enforcement units were bombed by the terrorist organization, using F-16 fighter jets. Tanks rolled through the streets and over people. Helicopters and military vehicles opened fire on civilians. The coup attempt was successfully repelled by our nation, which heroically preserved its democracy, Government, freedoms and future and the constitutional order.\nI therefore take pride in my nation\u2019s people, which defeated that heinous coup attempt at the risk of their lives. For a period of 29 days the people never abandoned the city squares of Turkey, remaining on call to protect our democracy. They threw their bodies in the way of tanks so as to repel the coup attempt. They took a very noble stand. If I am standing here before the Assembly today, it is because of our nation\u2019s brave and noble reaction. It should never be forgotten that the coup attempt in Turkey was aimed at democracy throughout the world as well. Our nation taught a historical lesson to those intending to carry out coup attempts and became a source of inspiration for all nations committed to protecting democracy.\nThe new generation of terrorist organizations poses a security threat, not only for Turkey but also for all 170 countries around the world in which such organizations exist. In other words, today the majority of the countries represented here in the General Assembly are currently under the threat of such clandestine structures. The terrorist organizations work on the premise of a deep-rooted psychological heresy aimed at subduing the whole world far beyond the borders of Turkey. The members are deviant in their actions. The basic strategy of the terrorist organizations is to infiltrate State institutions, influencing society and dominating economic resources under the disguise of education, dialogue, tolerance, non-governmental organizations and the best of intentions.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to call on all our friends to take the necessary measures against the Fethullahist terrorist organization in their own countries in order to protect the future of their own people and their well-being. Based on our experience, it is evident that, if you do not fight against the Fethullahist terrorist organization now, tomorrow may be too late. I would also like to take this opportunity to say that attributions such as \u201cTurkish\u201d or \u201cTurkey\u201d and all other similar labels used by that terrorist organization and the persons associated with it have no relation with Turkey.\nThe humanitarian crisis in Syria has reached its sixth year. To date, 600,000 people have reportedly lost their lives, and, because of the war, 12 million people have had to leave their country, 5 million of whom have taken refuge in other countries. There are now 2.7 million such people in our country. They were forced to leave their homes behind and have been welcomed in Turkey. We have never asked why they ended up in Turkey. Our doors are wide open. We have not shut our doors in their faces, because they were fleeing barrel bombs and fighter jets. For those people, we have had to assume our responsibilities and do what was expected of us.\nWhile the West and the rest of the world might not do so, we will continue to welcome them, because we are human beings. In the face of such an atrocity, we are obliged to keep our doors open to all those fleeing tyranny and oppression. We have opened our doors and kept them open. And we will continue to open our doors in the future. The international community has, unfortunately, remained indifferent to the suffering of people in conflict zones. The numbers that we have mentioned correspond to human beings.\nThe Syrian people are in a state of exhaustion in the grip of proxy wars that have been shaped by a cruel Administration, merciless terrorist organizations and global and regional competition. In that process, unfortunately, the international community has failed to live up to its humanitarian values and its collective conscience.\nTo date, Turkey has spent approximately $25 billion on the refugees, including money directed to non-governmental organizations and municipalities. Members might ask: what has Turkey received from the rest of the world? From the United Nations, we have received only $525 million in aid and nothing else. Have we received anything from the European Union (EU)? The EU made certain promises, which have, unfortunately, not been kept. It has allocated $178 million to UNICEF. That is all. Turkey itself has not directly received any aid whatsoever in financial terms.\nSince the beginning of the conflict, we have claimed that the problem was a common question for the rest of the world. We have been establishing close contacts in solidarity with influential international figures. The Syrians are our neighbours and brothers and sisters. We could not remain silent in the face of such tragedy and carnage. We have never remained silent and never will. Currently, 2.7 million refugees are being housed in our country, along with 300,000 Iraqis. A total number of 3 million refugees have never been subjected to any ethnic or religious discrimination in Turkey. We have opened our arms wide.\nIn addition to the tent and container cities in which we accommodate the refugees in Turkey, we will continue to provide all forms of support commensurate with our capabilities. We expect the EU and all other organizations that have pledged financial support to rise to the occasion. We expect them to keep their promises. Similarly, we expect the United Nations to keep its promises. I hope and pray that the General Assembly at its seventy-first session will loudly convey that message to the rest of the world, because the contributions of the international community should not be limited $512 million s. What is one to think?\nFrom this rostrum, I call upon the rest of the world, including my European friends who believe that the Syrian refugees represent a threat and clear danger to them. Barbed wire and high walls will never provide them with the safety, security or peace of mind that they are seeking. That effort is in vain. The problems of the Syrian refugees should be immediately solved once and for all. Otherwise, we will never be able to prevent the irregular migration, social issues and security risks embedded within that problem. We must not lose any more time in ending the conflict, the terrorism and the environment of persecution, which are the sources of the problem in Syria. We must urgently implement a political settlement process. We attach great importance to protecting Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have no claims whatsoever on Syrian territory. Syria belongs to the Syrian people. No one should ever have any plans whatsoever with regard to the territory of Syria.\nStarting with our support for the Syrian opposition, what is known as Operation Euphrates Shield was launched, which is critical to re-establishing stability, peace and prosperity in a region of despair. It became clear that, with the launching of that operation, the priority of the terrorist organization Kurdish Workers Party, or of the Kurdish Democratic Party, is in not fighting against Da\u2019esh. The operation \u2014 or offensive, as some prefer to call it \u2014 has also boosted the self-confidence of the moderate Syrian opposition forces. Furthermore, that development has provided encouragement to the local forces in Iraq that are eager to cleanse Mosul of the terror sowed by Da\u2019esh.\nAs those who are present here are probably aware, for a long time I have appealed for the establishment of a safe zone along our border with Syria, which at more than 900 kilometres is the longest border with Syria. Along that border, Turkey has been continuously under threat. We have been extremely patient. However, on 24 August, in the city of Gaziantep, next to the Syrian border, a wedding party was attacked by a 14-year-old suicide bomber, a boy sent there by Da\u2019esh terrorists. The blast killed 56 people and injured more than 100. We were patient until that critical moment. That was the precise time when we said, enough is enough.\nAlong with the moderate opposition, we initiated the offensive. Primarily in Jarabulus, we have eliminated Da\u2019esh and extended operations all the way to Al-Rai, where Da\u2019esh was repelled. The local inhabitants of Jarabulus were resettled, as were those from Al-Rai. From A\u2019zaz to the Euphrates, the entire region was saved from becoming a belt of terrorism. Instead, it was converted into a belt of peace. The operation we are conducting today has the eventual goal of protecting that safe zone and ensuring that it is in fact safe.\nThe people of Jarabulus were saved from the grip of the terrorists and are confident in returning to their homes. The electrical and water infrastructure will be made operational immediately. The Turkish Red Crescent, Turkish humanitarian aid organizations and all of the other non-governmental organizations have mobilized to meet the needs of the local inhabitants. All of the civil facilities needed by the local inhabitants will be constructed in the near future. In order to make that possible, the areas officially designated as safe zones should also be declared as no-fly zones. We must maintain a firm stand so as to ensure that a no-fly zone will be established for the protection and security of the region\u2019s inhabitants.\nIt is unfortunate that the ceasefire, a process that has received enormous investment, has failed. As is clear, a ceasefire is no longer possible. Yesterday, a United Nations convoy was attacked by the regime\u2019s forces, resulting in the death of one person and many others injured.\nThe Syrian regime has not allowed aid deliveries supervised by the United Nations to reach the people of Aleppo, who are in dire need. They are also attacking United Nations convoys. The regime is condemning people to famine and suffering, in order to encourage them to surrender or to die. The United Nations and the Security Council should no longer tolerate the regime\u2019s policies.\nIn Iraq it is clear that it will not be easy to establish a political system to effectively protect its ethnic and sectarian diversity, which makes up the greatest underlying strength of the country. Within that context, the Mosul operation should be conducted by taking into consideration the sensitivities of the people of the region. Otherwise, a new humanitarian crisis will emerge, leading to the influx of yet another 1 million people seeking refuge in other countries. We cannot leave the Iraqi people alone at this critical juncture, when they need the support of the international community now more than ever.\nAllowing the Palestinian people to live in an independent Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the two-State solution, is an obligation of the international community to Palestinian children, if nothing else. Israel, especially, should respect the sanctity of the Temple Mount and put an end to violations of its status.\nWe will try to benefit from our normalized relations with Israel to facilitate the peace process and resolve the economic and humanitarian challenges faced by our Palestinian brothers and sisters through every possible effort. In that vein, we will continue our efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip.\nThat brings me to a very important point. The World Humanitarian Summit was held in May, in Turkey, for the first time in history. We consider that Summit to have provided an important opportunity to explore new ways of more effective crisis intervention around the world. In that connection, I would like to be clear in my remarks. With respect to providing support to the least developed countries around the world, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States rank among the top three donors. But in the ratio comparing the amount of humanitarian aid to gross domestic product, Turkey is ranked number one in the world.\nWe are the country housing the most significant number of refugees around the world, and we are doing everything within our ability to stop irregular migration. Upon Turkey\u2019s initiative, the subject of Syrian refugees was addressed by the General Assembly last year for the first time. Similarly, migration and terrorism were incorporated into the Group of 20 agenda, thanks to Turkey\u2019s efforts. We are cooperating with the European Union on the refugee crisis to the greatest extent possible.\nBased on the goal of preventing deaths in the Aegean Sea, we have succeeded in reducing the irregular migration number to 50 people per day; whereas, in October 2015, that number had reached 7,000 per day. That shows that Turkey has successfully fulfilled its commitments under the framework of the refugee agreement with the EU. However, we regret that the promises made by the EU in the context of the agreement of 18 March have been forgotten, while ongoing false pretexts prevail and excuses are all that we hear.\nThe Security Council must be reformed to improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We fully appreciate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s progress in that respect. Furthermore, it is obvious that, unless the Security Council, as the main organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, is reformed, such efforts will be in vain and the task will remain unfulfilled.\nThat is why we say that the world is greater than the five permanent members. We have been reminding the international community of that fact over and over again with every chance we get. The Security Council was established in the aftermath of the Second World War. One cannot preserve the same structure of the Council under the circumstances of modern times. One cannot condemn the fate of the rest of the world to depend on what the five permanent members in the Security Council say. There are five permanent seat-holders and 10 non-permanent seat-holders in the Security Council. That is not a proper Security Council. A Council that does not represent the entire world can never serve to re-establish peace and justice around the world. That is something that we need to revisit over and over again. Can everyone think about that \u2014 three European countries, one country in Asia and one country, the United States of America, of course \u2014 five countries as the permanent seat-holders? What about the rest of the world? What about the other countries around the world? They have remained on the sidelines. We ignore them.\nInstead, why not have 20 countries as permanent seat-holders in the Security Council, under a rotational system? In that system, each country would, deservedly, be represented on the Security Council every year or every two years. That is the only way to establish fairness and justice. The representative nature of the Security Council should be established so that the organ will be much more effective, more just.\nIn order for that to be possible, the General Assembly has to reach complete consensus. Please do not even consider remaining silent, or else we cannot achieve anything. We cannot succeed in our policies. We have to engage in spying, so to say. We have to be strong. We have to stand on our two feet, and talk about the truth and nothing but the truth. We have to stand behind the truth. We are the politicians. Only in that way can the world attain the level of justice that it yearns for. This is the only way to achieve democracy.\nIslamophobia is an alternate name for racism and discrimination. We see it prevailing in countries with a large Muslim population. About a decade ago, along with the then Prime Minister of Spain, we co-chaired the initiative of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations project that aimed to find permanent solutions to such dangerous movements that threaten our prosperity around the world. Similarly, we are also glad that interest in the Mediation for Peace Initiative that we pioneered along with Finland in 2010 under the auspices of the United Nations has increased.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we have jointly developed, includes ambitious and transformative goals for us all. Official development assistance makes up the most important resource for supporting development efforts, notably for the least developed countries (LDCs). Turkey\u2019s official development assistance reached $3.9 billion in 2015. As I have previously mentioned, the 0.54 per cent of our gross domestic product, which is the ratio of humanitarian aid that we provide, is beyond the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average and helps us approach the United Nations target, which is 0.7 per cent. Turkey has surpassed its commitment to provide $200 million annually to LDCs in 2011, and has delivered more than $1.5 billion to LDCs in a mere five-year period.\nBefore concluding my remarks, I hope and pray that the seventy-first session of the General Assembly will be the beginning of a new age to alleviate the pain and suffering of people around the world, and that it will help us change our world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is now 71 years since our Organization, the United Nations, was created to ensure peace, security, cooperation, economic development and respect for human rights worldwide. During those 71 years, our Organization has been successful in those areas. That success would have been impossible without the work and unwavering dedication shown by the tens of thousands of women and men employed today by the United Nation. I would like to take this opportunity to honour them.\nI also pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has led our Organization with courage and wisdom throughout the past decade. I congratulate him on his work, particularly regarding the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, where his commitment proved instrumental, and also for his role in the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Finally, I would like to express once again our gratitude for his commitment to Africa, and to the Niger in particular. We could always count on his support during the multifaceted crises that our country has experienced in recent years.\nIn September last year, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which aims to eradicate poverty by that year and leave no one behind in the process. At the heart of that project is our commitment to place mankind at the centre of development and meet the requirements and limitations of our planet Earth in terms of our production and consumption habits.\nTwo months later, the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change came to complete that important campaign through a package of actions aiming, on the one hand, at limiting the rise in the average global temperature to less than 2\u00b0C, thanks to courageous measures to mitigate the causes of climate change, and on the other hand, at taking measures to strengthen resilience in the face of climate change. Therefore, the theme of this session \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d \u2014 is very much in line with the transformational vision and mission of the climate-change programme.\nThe evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in late 2015 showed that even though not all the Goals were met, remarkable progress had indeed been made. We note in that connection that in the fight against poverty, the goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty was achieved in 2010. Similarly, in education, the number of school- age children not in school was halved, and in the health area, infant and maternal mortality was also halved.\nUnfortunately, those positive results hide huge disparities and inequalities. In fact, those results were strongly influenced by progress in Asia and Latin America owing to high and sustained growth rates there over the period. African countries, especially those in the sub-Saharan region, have seen little progress and continue to face significant challenges in terms of development and the fight against poverty.\nThe results obtained through the achievement of the MDGs are the starting point from which we begin our journey towards fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Our capacity to achieve our goals by that deadline will depend on our ability to change political and economic conditions, both in individual countries and on a global scale. It will also depend on our ability to honour the commitments we undertook at the Paris Conference on Climate Change.\nTurning to political and economic conditions, the current situation does not inspire optimism. It is, therefore, essential that we create a new type of political and economic governance worldwide. In the economic sphere, it is obvious that the functioning of the global economy must be fully re-evaluated. We need to find a better balance between speculative financial capital and industrial capital by orienting more capital towards the real economy. Such a new approach would enable developing countries to receive more capital and more investment. That, in turn, would sustain stronger economic growth, which would lead to global economic growth and stability.\nInternational measures to support direct foreign investment in the least developed countries are important, something that we should put in place as soon as possible. They are crucial in the framework of the support that that group of countries requires in order to realize economic and social development. The fact that such a programme seeks to strengthen assistance to those countries that need it most, specifically the least developed countries, reveals the inclusive dimension of the programme. We welcome in particular the willingness to step up the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020, reaffirmed in the Istanbul Declaration, and the Programme of Action resulting from the Midterm Review Conference for the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, held in Antalya, Turkey, last May.\nThe Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries, whose first three-year strategic plan was approved by its governing body in July, will be commissioned in 2017 and will be a valuable instrument for promoting infrastructure development, diversifying production and creating added value. That is essential for strengthening income-generation and increasing the incomes of people in those countries.\nReforming the international financial system, creating new possibilities for access to sources of financing, and establishing an adequate framework for restructuring sovereign debt are all are indispensable measures if we are to strengthen the economic capabilities of developing countries in the area of financing sustainable development. The same applies to mobilizing the private sector and encouraging it to take a greater stake in working towards the goals of collective development.\nWith regard to the United Nations, we encourage the long-term positioning of United Nations funds, programmes and agencies to favour development. Such an approach is about promoting consistency and complementarity, which are key for the development work of those entities to be effective. Programmes that are at the centre of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must make it possible for Africa to become better integrated into global trade. But that integration will be beneficial to the continent only if we put an end to the unequal terms of trade.\nSeveral studies have in fact demonstrated that if the share of African countries in global trade were to increase by only 1 per cent, that would provide additional annual income of more than $200 billion \u2014 about five times the amount received by Africa in the form of official development assistance. Concretely, Africa would receive greater resources if the unequal exchanges were discontinued.\nAfrica must also have the firm political resolve to develop intra-African commerce, which now accounts for only 10 per cent of trade. We need for it to reach a level that would strengthen our position in global trade.\nReaching the Sustainable Development Goals will be feasible only with greater synergy in action, robust solidarity and, most importantly, respect for all of the commitments undertaken by the global partnerships for development.\nOn the political front, the United Nations needs thorough reform. The governance of the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, needs to be reviewed. That process is long overdue. The Organization should be made effective and legitimate in the way it addresses essential issues of peace and international security. The reform must rectify the existing anachronisms \u2014 both the current system of geographical representation in the Council, and the methods whereby decisions are taken. The consequences of those methods are sometimes disastrous and have had effects that are the opposite of what is sought.\nOn the modalities of Security Council decision-making, it is essential that the countries most affected in issues before the Council, especially the neighbouring countries of countries in conflict, be involved and heard in the conflict-resolution process. Neighbouring countries, which often share the same communities on both sides of the borders, are the first to suffer from the effects of conflict. The Council must therefore absolutely take into account the concerns expressed by those countries so as to avoid situations of the kind that currently exists in Libya.\nThe field of peacekeeping operations is of particular interest to the Niger, a country that is engaged in a merciless struggle against terrorism and in protecting its territory. Based on experience, and faced with the evidence of the inadequacy of current approaches to peacekeeping, which have shown their limits on many occasions, we are convinced that those approaches can and should be improved. In that regard, the Niger believes that the mandates of certain United Nations missions urgently need revision so as to strengthen their offensive capabilities, with a view to improving their ability to respond to the challenge of protecting civilians.\nMy country fully supports a major strategic change, particularly given the general trend of attacks by warring parties and other non-State groups against civilians.\nFor the populations concerned, it is inconceivable that, in the face of terrorist acts and abuses inflicted on local people, the peacekeeping missions deployed on the ground to protect them are powerless to avert the imminent massacres of civilians at the most crucial moments. The missions must be able to take decisive and effective action.\nIn reality, no one can predict what is going to happen between now and 2030. All we can say is that we will not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals unless there is a profound change in political and economic governance. We live in an uncertain world. We live in an unstable world that is facing all types of visible and invisible threats. Achieving the SDGs in an unstable and chaotic world will therefore be a non-linear, unstable and chaotic process that can suffer great impacts from small things.\nI recall the famous metaphor of the so-called butterfly effect, whereby a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a storm in Texas. The butterfly effect is that drop of water that makes the vase overflow. The signs of tension that we see here and there in the world can be the little sparks that might provoke a vast fire. These signs of tension are currently being obscured by the fight against terrorism, but the rivalries and other competitions among the great Powers can lead to irreparable consequences.\nSmall countries often bear the costs of the rivalries of the great Powers and suffer the consequences of some of their failures to understand. The chaos that we are currently seeing in Libya and its impacts on neighbouring countries attest to that fact. Those effects and the presence of terrorist organizations in northern Mali and in the Lake Chad Basin, where Boko Haram is committing atrocities, could irreparably compromise the ability of the countries affected to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. In the Niger, where Boko Haram carries out regular incursions, we have more than 167,000 internally displaced persons, about a 100,000 refugees at risk of starvation and epidemics, and more than 18,000 children who cannot go to school. It is therefore urgent that we stabilize the situation in Libya. It is urgent that we help Libya to emerge from that chaos. It is urgent that we stabilize Mali and neutralize terrorists. It is urgent that we support the Multinational Joint Task Force that is operating in the Lake Chad Basin against Boko Haram.\nThe terrorist threats at our doorstep have led our country to redirect significant resources to the security sector. Without that, the Niger could have achieved the Millennium Development Goals and started the process of implementing the SDGs under much better conditions. Ten per cent of our budgetary resources have been oriented towards defence and security. In spite of that, the Niger was able to reduce poverty from 63 per cent in 2011 to 45 per cent in 2015, to achieve MDG 1, on reducing extreme hunger and poverty by half, Goal 4, on significantly reducing child and maternal mortality, and the MDG target on access to water and sanitation in urban areas.\nOur recovery programme will allow us to further improve those results and move toward the implementation of the SDGs. My ambition is to leave the country, at the end of my last term, radically transformed \u2014 a Niger where democratic institutions are stronger, where the fight against corruption has made great strides, and where inequalities have been beaten back and the middle class has grown; a united, peaceful and safe Niger with zero hunger and well equipped with infrastructure of every kind; a Niger that has made good progress on its demographic transition process, where school is free and compulsory for all persons under 16 years, where 40 per cent of our children attend vocational and technical training and leave with a trade or profession, and where universities train the most competent professionals for the subregion; a Niger with access to health, where clean water and sanitation are ensured and where employment, specifically for young people, is abundant; and, finally, a country resolutely engaged on the way to the unity of our continent \u2014 in other words, a Niger resolutely set along the way to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n"

        "file_text": "It pleases me at the outset to convey my heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also seize this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his exemplary stewardship of the Organization as Secretary-General throughout the past decade. As he leaves office at the end of this year, I wish him the very best in his future endeavours. He will be remembered for the rich legacy that he is leaving behind.\nLast year, the Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, setting new benchmarks that will shape our future. We acknowledged the importance of every Goal, every target and every indicator as steps towards a better world. Our collective response and our solidarity in the face of the challenges that will arise as we try to carve out a sustainable world will determine whether we succeed in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each country has its priorities and will need to formulate a unique set of actions in order to achieve the universal goals that we have set for ourselves.\nIn that context, the United Nations will have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of individual countries. In Mauritius, we have chosen to focus our attention primarily on the eradication of extreme forms of poverty. My Government, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme, has already undertaken to establish a social register of those living in dismal conditions and who require targeted measures and assistance.\nAs a first unprecedented measure, we have introduced in this year\u2019s national budget a subsistence allowance for the extreme poor based on a threshold of 2,720 Mauritian rupees per adult. That threshold is 40 per cent higher than the World Bank International Extreme Poverty Line of of $3.10 per day per individual, calculated on the basis of purchasing power parity.\nThere are yet many miles to go, and we will resolutely pursue our journey towards attaining all of the SDGs by working together with the private sector and civil society. We are fully committed to creating a more equitable system, to safeguarding rule of law and to ensuring equal access to justice for all, as encapsulated in Goal 16 on peace and justice. The United Nations will be tested in the effort to achieve Goal 16 on an international scale, for we are conscious of the power of \u2018Might against right\u2019. Nevertheless, Mauritius will persevere in its fight for the vulnerable.\nFor a small island developing State like ours, Goal 13 on climate action and Goal 14 on the oceans are of paramount importance for our survival. We are pleased that we have now crossed the first threshold for the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 60 countries that have ratified the Agreement are responsible for 47.76 per cent of global emissions. For small island developing States (SIDS), the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement is of paramount importance.\nThe tourism industry in SIDS faces particular challenges owing to the negative effects of global warming. Taking measures to reverse that trend is essential to us in order to preserve marine and coastal ecosystems and biodiversity, and to foster the clean and sustainable use of our oceans. Mauritius will ensure that the steps it takes to advance its ocean economy are in synergy with sustainability principles.\nIn that context, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that on 1 and 2 September Mauritius, with the support of the World Bank, hosted the African Ministerial Conference on Ocean Economies and Climate Change. The Mauritius Communiqu\u00e9, which encapsulates the outcome of the Conference, will serve as an input for the Green Climate Fund Africa Dialogue to be held next month in Cape Town. Mauritius will also contribute to the discussions at the African Union Extraordinary Summit on Maritime Security and Safety and Development in Africa, scheduled for 15 October in Togo, and at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, from 7 to 18 November, in Morocco.\nLet me highlight the fact that during the Conference in Mauritius, African Ministers, along with our development partners \u2014 in particular the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \u2014 agreed that a technical and financial assistance package is imperative in order to support ocean economies and ensure the resilience of oceans and coastal areas to climate change. We look forward to the adoption of such a package at the Climate Change Conference in Morocco.\nAddressing the causes and effects of climate change will require robust determination and strong political will, as well as extraordinary means, in terms of both financing and technology transfer. We highly appreciate the pledges made by countries such as France and Canada to provide financing to fight climate change. However, access to those resources needs to be simplified and needs to take into account the specific circumstances of individual countries.\nTwo days ago, Mauritius and the Commonwealth Secretariat signed a host country agreement for the establishment in Mauritius of a Climate Finance Access Hub, as had been decided at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Malta in November 2015. The Hub will help small island developing States and least developed countries to unlock critical climate funds.\nAll our efforts to make our planet sustainable and to leave a proud legacy for future generations will be in vain if we are unable to maintain peace and security in the world and if we do not adhere to the invaluable principles of the rule of law and democracy. That is why Mauritius vehemently condemns, without reservation, the multiple acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms.\nWe believe that a reformed United Nations, including a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, is essential to the global capacity to respond effectively to terrorist threats and new situations. An enlarged and more representative Security Council will further strengthen the United Nations role in furthering peace and security and the rule of law across the globe. Mauritius adheres to the African position on the reform of the Security Council, as elaborated in the Ezulwini Consensus. We believe that the historical injustice done to Africa with regard to representation on the Council should be redressed. We also support a dedicated seat for SIDS. In addition, Mauritius fully supports India\u2019s aspiration to a permanent seat.\nWhile the formal recognition of Palestine by the United Nations as an observer is a very positive development, we must exert relentless efforts to work towards the goal of having two distinct, independent, secure and viable States, Palestine and Israel, living peacefully side by side.\nThe firm belief of Mauritius in the Charter of the United Nations and in the legitimacy of a fair and just multilateral system is unshakable. Every nation has a right to peace, justice, the rule of law and democracy, and every human being has the right to basic human rights. That is the basis on which the Mauritius Constitution is built. Those are also the principles enshrined in the Charter. The full realization of those principles will not be possible, however, unless complete decolonization is accomplished.\nIt was 48 years ago that my country became a free and sovereign nation, an independent country in the eyes of the world. Yet even today, it is unable to exercise its sovereignty over parts of its territory, namely, the Chagos Archipelago and Tromelin Island. On 8 November 1965, prior to granting Mauritius its independence on 12 March 1968, the United Kingdom illegally excised the Chagos Archipelago from the territory of Mauritius, purportedly in order to create the so-called British Indian Ocean territory. That excision was carried out in violation of international law and General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965, 2232 (XXI) of 20 December 1966, and 2357 (XXII) of 19 December 1967.\nResolution 1514 (XV) stipulates that any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It clearly prohibits the dismemberment of any colonial territory prior to independence. In addition to excising that integral part of our territory, the Mauritians living in the Chagos Archipelago were forcibly evicted from their home and moved to the main island of Mauritius in total disregard for their human rights. The Government of Mauritius is fully sensitive to their plight and their rightful aspiration to resettle in the Chagos Archipelago, as per their legitimate right as citizens of Mauritius. We are determined to resettle those who were forcibly evicted from the Archipelago upon its return to the effective control of Mauritius, in full respect of all their rights and dignity.\nMy delegation includes the spokesperson for Mauritians of Chagossian origin. He represents a whole community whose human rights have been flouted. His presence also testifies to the fact that the issue of sovereignty and the right of return of Mauritian Chagossians to their native lands cannot be dissociated. Mauritius has consistently protested against the illegal excision of the Chagos Archipelago and has unequivocally maintained that the Chagos Archipelago, including the island of Diego Garcia, forms an integral part of its territory, under both Mauritian law and international law. Mauritius has also consistently pressed for the completion of the decolonization process.\nFor decades, Mauritius has called on the former colonial Power to engage with us in order to find a fair and just solution, but our efforts have been in vain so far. Despite the blatant violation of resolution 1514 (XV), the United Kingdom maintains that its continued presence in the Chagos Archipelago is lawful. Yet the United Kingdom also tacitly admits the impropriety of its action in dismembering the territory of Mauritius, as evidenced by the undertaking which it has given on various occasions that the Chagos Archipelago will be returned to Mauritius when no longer required for defence purposes.\nThat undertaking has been held to be legally binding by the arbitral tribunal established in the case brought by Mauritius against the United Kingdom under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to challenge the legality of the marine protected area purportedly established by the United Kingdom around the Chagos Archipelago. However, the United Kingdom has not honoured that undertaking so far, It keeps changing the criteria, which rely on the contention that the use of the Chagos Archipelago is still required for defence purposes.\nThe arbitral tribunal ruled that the creation of the purported marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago by the United Kingdom was in violation of international law. Two of the arbitrators found that the excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 showed a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of Mauritius by the United Kingdom, in violation of the right to self determination, and that the United Kingdom is not the coastal State in relation to the Chagos Archipelago. That finding was not contradicted by the other two members of the arbitral tribunal.\nThe General Assembly has a direct institutional interest in the matter, given the historic and central role that it has played in the process of decolonization throughout the world. The Assembly has a continuing responsibility to complete the process of decolonization, including that of Mauritius. That is why, at the request of the Government of Mauritius, the General Assembly has included in the agenda of its seventy-first session item 87, \u201cRequest for an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965\u201d. An advisory opinion would assist the Assembly in its work on decolonization in general and the decolonization of Mauritius in particular, pursuant to the requirements of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\nI would like to insist on the fact that the decision to have recourse to that action was not taken with an adversarial intent. This is not the first time that an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice is being sought on such a subject. In our view, the procedure represents a legitimate recourse, and it abides by the provisions of the Charter and past practice of the United Nations. We have noted that the United Kingdom has now expressed the wish to engage in dialogue with Mauritius in order to sort the matter out by June 2017. Mauritius has always believed in true dialogue. We are acting in good faith, and we expect the same from our interlocutors.\nWe believe that the Assembly has the duty to assist in the completion of the decolonization process. Mauritius is of the view that an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in respect of the Chagos Archipelago will undoubtedly assist the Assembly in the discharge of that responsibility. I wish to heartily thank member States of the African Union, the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, the Non-Aligned Group, and the Group of 77 and China, among others, which have openly expressed their support to my country. I know that when it comes to justice, human dignity and territorial integrity, the Assembly will live up to its mission. We concur with the position of the United Kingdom on a rule-based international system. However, we have to be coherent, not only in what we say, but also in what we do.\nThe decolonization of Mauritius will also not be fully resolved until the issue of Tromelin is settled. We have had very constructive dialogue with France, and we urge France to pursue that dialogue with Mauritius\nfor the early resolution of the dispute over the island in the continued spirit of friendship that has characterized the relationship between our two countries.\nTerritorial integrity is a principle of international law. The United Nations recognizes it as such, it is therefore our duty to ensure that it is respected.\nTo conclude, I would like to call on the entire membership of the United Nations to stand by the right to justice, to show that a better and safer world is possible only when it is compatible with the rule of law, and to show commitment to the principles of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the General Assembly this afternoon on behalf of my country, Ireland. My address will be framed under the overall theme of migration, an issue which in itself is a huge challenge for the global community today, but also an issue that intersects with so many of the other challenges we continue to grapple with as a community of nations.\nAs I stand at this rostrum in the great city of New York, I am acutely aware of my own country\u2019s long experience \u2014 over several centuries \u2014 with emigration. Indeed, on the newly restored lawn just outside this building, a haunting bronze sculpture by acclaimed Irish sculptor John Behan, entitled Arrival, depicts a huddled group of Irish emigrants ready to disembark in New York after fleeing starvation and poverty in their native Ireland. Our own history as a people forms the enduring backdrop to our foreign policy agenda. That part of our past is unfortunately the tragic present for so many.\nThe origins of the migration crisis are complex and diffuse. Many migrants and refugees are fleeing conflict and violence; many others are fleeing poverty and deprivation. The vast scale and sustained nature of the movement is at times bewildering and threatens to overwhelm our rules-based migration systems. It confronts us with a wide array of problems to overcome all at the same time: the harrowing violence in Syria, the barbarism of Da\u2019esh, the collapse of order within Libya and the practices of ruthless people-smugglers. The continuous poverty and inequality in many parts of Africa is also a significant driver of the mass movement of people. These are challenges that no one country can resolve alone. These are challenges that must all be tackled at the same time. These are challenges that require the international community of nations to work in close cooperation to overcome them.\nIreland is responding to the migration crisis in a variety of ways. We have given priority to funding humanitarian relief. We have provided over \u20ac60 million in support of the Syrian people in the region, most of it through United Nations organizations. We have deployed ships from our naval service to the Mediterranean to assist with vital search-and-rescue missions. Ireland is participating in the European Union programme to resettle refugees fleeing conflict. Here, at United Nations Headquarters, Ireland has acted as a facilitator, together with Jordan, to deliver the agreement on the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1).\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend Ireland\u2019s team at the United Nations, led by Ambassador David Donoghue, and our Jordanian colleagues, for their stalwart efforts over five months of negotiations among 193 Member States. Ireland accepted this leadership role at the United Nations because we know that no country can by itself resolve the vast challenges the world currently faces.\nIn my address, I wish to set out why I believe a multilateral approach is the only one that can work and why the United Nations must demonstrate its capacity to really deliver on solutions. I will set out how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 which the United Nations agreed one year ago following a successful facilitation process shared by Ireland and Kenya \u2014 have the capacity, when implemented, to address many of the root causes of migration, by ending poverty, reducing inequality and responding to climate change.\nIreland is seeking election to the Security Council in 2020. We believe that our values and principles and our steadfast commitment to the United Nations will enable us to make a valuable contribution if we are successful in that election. Today, I am asking for support from the nations that share these vital values.\nLast year, the United Nations marked 70 years since its establishment. At that time, we in Ireland celebrated 60 years of active membership. On the occasion of that important anniversary, two things were clear: first, the global challenges confronting the United Nations were more complex than ever before, and secondly, the United Nations and the international community have the potential to respond to these challenges in a comprehensive way. We demonstrated this potential through the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the SDGs, which were greatly significant in that they embody commitments by Member States to working across a range of issues to eliminate poverty and achieve sustained development over the next 15 years.\nThe determined implementation of the SDGs will enable us to address many of the root causes of migration. Lack of economic opportunity is a substantial driver of migration. To provide those opportunities, the SDGs set out an approach that involves investment in health care, education, water and sanitation and other essential services.\nAs States Members of the United Nations, we are now called to meet our obligation to implement the SDGs domestically within our own borders, bilaterally with our development partners, and multilaterally within regional and United Nations forums. Long-term action on underlying causes must be complemented by urgent steps to address the daily suffering arising from the refugee and migrant crisis. Ireland is committed to honouring pledges made at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul.\nWe must collectively ensure that in addressing crises closer to home we do not allow the more protracted crises, those that do not appear in the headlines on a daily basis, to be forgotten. The United Nations has a central role in humanitarian action. Ireland strongly supports the efforts to reform the United Nations system and coordination mechanisms to ensure a more effective response to the complex humanitarian needs around the world, including the protection of vulnerable groups in emergencies, most notably women and girls.\nThe most immediate trigger of mass migration is violent conflict, which forces great numbers of people to flee their homes and leave their communities. The horrific human toll of the grinding conflict in Syria mounts daily, and many countries in the region and far beyond are grappling with the large-scale displacement of people that this conflict has created.\nNo two conflicts are comparable. However, I can say that on my own island, on the island of Ireland, for many years we experienced conflict, terrorism and loss of life. And with the support of a wide array of stakeholders, we eventually and painstakingly managed to build a sustainable peace process. Our lived experience of building peace and the ongoing process of reconciliation on the island of Ireland mean that we are particularly conscious of the persistent and determined commitment required to overcome conflict. We therefore give priority to investment in conflict prevention and post-conflict reconciliation.\nWe recognize the importance of the empowerment of women so that they can have a visible and recognized role in the decision-making process. Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are key cross-cutting priorities for my country, Ireland. We are committed to strengthening our engagement on these priorities during our membership in the Commission on the Status of Women, which commences on 1 January 2017. Ireland calls for the implementation of the conflict- prevention and peacebuilding aspects of the three high- level reviews of the United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding systems, which took place in 2015, and for a sustained commitment to the women and peace and security agenda.\nWe in Ireland know all too well that negotiating lasting political solutions for conflicts is often a lengthy task, with many stops and starts and setbacks along the way. Ireland welcomes and is actively participating in the initiative led by France to revive the stalled Middle East peace process, with the aim of leading ultimately to a negotiated two-State solution. The United Nations must play a central role in efforts to create the conditions for finding a political solution.\nSix years into the horrific conflict in Syria, Ireland reaffirms its full support for the tireless efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to bring about an end to the devastating conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. We urge everybody in this Hall to play his or her part.\nThe continent of Africa is of course the source, but also the host, of the largest number of migrants and refugees, many of whom are fleeing war and poverty. Ireland calls for a transparent, accountable and human-rights-based resolution to the numerous conflicts in African countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those conflicts are severely hampering sustainable development on the continent and creating enormous humanitarian burdens for the affected countries, indeed for neighbouring countries as well, and the wider international community.\nOn a positive note, Ireland warmly welcomes the historic peace agreement reached in Colombia last month following five decades of conflict, four years of talks and, tragically, the killing of over 225,000 people. Each of these deaths represents a horrendous loss to their families and their loved ones and to their communities. We look forward to the signature of the final peace accord later this month, and we welcome the vital role played by the United Nations in monitoring the implementation of that process. Ireland is committed to actively supporting the Colombian peace process. We are pleased to offer whatever assistance we can to the process of rebuilding the country after decades of violence, including through the sharing of our experience in Northern Ireland. We wish the people of Colombia well at this time of hope.\nAs part of our commitment to conflict prevention and resolution, we have championed, over many long years, the matter of disarmament and non-proliferation, which must be placed at the fore of our collective efforts to prevent or minimize the impact of future conflict. We must all be mindful of the grave humanitarian consequences of any nuclear detonation, as well as the devastating impact of conventional, biological and chemical weapons. We have seen this year \u2014 in fact, we have seen this month \u2014 how a State Member of the United Nations can show in stark terms the reality of the risk of a nuclear detonation.\nIreland wishes to see genuine progress on multilateral nuclear disarmament, building on the work of the Open-ended Working Group. We are also concerned at evidence of harm to civilians from the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects and consequences in populated areas. The disproportionate gender impact of nuclear weapons and of illegal arms transfers and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons is also a matter of great concern to us, as is the need to ensure greater gender balance in all disarmament discussions.\nEffective and responsible United Nations peacekeeping is an important means of preventing forced displacement at a time of conflict or uneasy peace. Ireland is strongly committed to its active role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are proud of our unbroken record of service extending over almost six decades.\nThis year we marked 100 years since our own Easter Rising, which set Ireland on the final phase of our path to independence, a highlight of our ongoing commitment to peace, development and freedom. Our commemoration included a parade of our defence forces marching through the streets of our capital city, Dublin. Many of those marching proudly wore the blue berets of the United Nations, as an emblem of their service with this great Organization. I take this opportunity to commend Irish soldiers and police participating in seven United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world for their courage, their bravery and their sacrifice.\nAn Irish Major General assumed the role of Head of Mission and Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in July, and in November, we will assume the leadership of its Irish/ Finnish battalion. We also remain actively committed to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. I recently visited troops in the Golan and was very struck by the greater challenge of their operating environment today, compared with that of when the mission was established some years ago. I therefore urge colleagues in the United Nations to ensure that our troops are adequately supported as they go about this important, challenging and often dangerous work.\nIn Ireland, service with the United Nations is rightly regarded as both noble and important. The effectiveness of the United Nations depends on its positive reputation as a force for good in the world. Therefore, it is critical that the performance, behaviour and reputation of troops or civilians engaged in United Nations operations be held to the highest possible standard. Sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers sent to conflict zones to protect innocent civilians from harm is totally unacceptable. Ireland calls for an end to impunity for these crimes. We absolutely commit to holding our own troops fully accountable for their behaviour when they are deployed overseas.\nHuman rights abuses are among the root causes of migration. Moreover, migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons, in particular women, children and vulnerable people, can also be at risk of human rights abuse both during their journey and on arrival at their destination.\nIreland is committed to defending those who defend the human rights of others, including journalists and other civil-society representatives who face increasing restrictions and threats in many parts of the world. Our leadership in the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 32/31, on civil society space, last June enabled the international community to send a strong message of solidarity to those at risk. Ireland will always speak out to defend minorities who continue to suffer persecution because of religion, belief, ethnicity or gender, or a host of other reasons. We will continue to work on the European Union resolution on freedom of religion or belief during this session of the General Assembly.\nOn the matter of United Nations reform, I am pleased that the agreement reached on the SDGs has showed what the United Nations can achieve when working at its best. We call for all members of the Security Council \u2014 in particular China, the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and France \u2014 to refrain from voting against credible draft resolutions on action to halt the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, including conflict-related sexual violence.\nIreland believes that the Security Council membership should be more balanced and ensure wider regional representation, particularly with regard to Africa. The more open, transparent and inclusive process taking place this year to select the new Secretary- General is a positive step in the right direction.\nWe must collectively do all that we can to ensure that the 65 million people currently displaced, whether by conflict, natural disaster or oppression, are provided with the essential services to which they are entitled. We need to uphold on all occasions the values, purposes and principles of the United Nations. These are the values, purposes and principles that Ireland has stood up for throughout our engagement with the United Nations regime, and which will inspire our contribution to the Security Council, should the membership entrust us with that responsibility in the 2020 election.\n"

        "file_text": "It is always an honour for me to address the General Assembly. It is also a responsibility \u2014 above all given the serious and worrying situation in the world. I stand before those present on behalf of France to issue several appeals. First, I would like to ask all members to do everything possible to implement the historic Agreement that was signed in Paris on 12 December 2015. The Agreement was historic because the conference was held at a time when Paris, the capital of France, had been struck by terrorist attacks. The Agreement was historic because, for the first time, the assembled international community agreed to make a commitment to reducing global warming and mobilizing financing, while allowing the most vulnerable countries to make an energy transition.\nAnd yet, standing before the Assembly, let me state once again that despite the momentous nature of the Agreement, there is no time to lose. The past two years have been the hottest known to humankind since records began. Admittedly, in April 2016, right here with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an agreement was signed with 175 countries. But everyone here knows that it will come into force only if it is ratified by 55 per cent of countries, representing 55 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States and China have announced their decision to ratify, which is very important. Nothing would have been possible without the participation and the commitment of those two countries, which are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide. France itself will notify the United Nations tomorrow that it has completed its ratification procedure. I appeal to all members to speed up their ratification procedures so that the goal is met by the end of the year.\nThe twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-21) was a conference of decisions. The twenty-second session, to be held in Marrakech, should be a conference of solutions. It is a question of implementing the International Solar Alliance, fighting desertification, protecting the seas and also setting a carbon price.\nHowever, the appeal I want to issue to the Assembly, following this climate agreement, is an appeal for Africa. Africa is a continent full of promise, but its development could be hindered by climate change, migration, conflict, war and terrorism. The continent has a bright future; however, it may also be the one to cause growing insecurity, and that insecurity targets, first and foremost, Africans themselves.\nThat is why, on behalf of France, I am proposing a 2020 agenda for Africa. The plan should make it possible for all Africans to gain access to electricity. Two thirds of Africans today are deprived of it. That is an injustice, but above all it impedes sustainable growth in Africa. What is at stake, therefore, is responding to the needs of 15 per cent of the world population. What is at stake is enabling Africans to benefit from their immense potential for development. What is at issue here is reducing population displacements, that is, migration, which leads to the destabilization of both countries of origin and destination.\nThat is why, at the Paris Conference, I launched the African Renewable Energy Initiative. Ten donors \u2014 and I want thank them here \u2014 pledged to donate $10 billion by 2020. France has assumed 20 per cent of that amount, or \u20ac2 billion. Europe has decided on an external investment plan, which could reach \u2014 still with a view to providing Africans with access to electricity \u2014 nearly \u20ac40 billion, and even double that amount if European Union member States contribute as well. I call on all countries to join that effort. I am not just calling for solidarity here \u2014 for this is a mutual investment that will benefit the whole world \u2014 I call for this to happen as soon as possible.\nBut there will be no development in Africa unless the continent\u2019s security is ensured. When I committed France to acting in Mali, it did so with an awareness of its responsibility. We had to prevent terrorist groups from taking over an entire country and destabilizing an entire region. Today, that threat has been rolled back and Mali is regaining its territorial integrity. But other groups, including Boko Haram and Al-Qaida, are emerging to threaten the security of many countries in West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. There too, France is supporting military forces with training, information-sharing and assistance in the fight against terrorism. We are doing so, for instance, in the Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Benin and Cameroon. We should expand such efforts along with the United Nations and the African Union.\nLet us be clear \u2014 the security of Africans has to come from Africans themselves if we want to avoid external intrusion and interference. My appeal for development and renewable energy is also a call for the security of Africans, for equipping their armies and giving them the means to respond, and for these African nations to organize their own development in a free and sovereign manner.\nThe last call I wish to make here is perhaps the saddest of all. It is for Syria. The Syrian tragedy will go down in history as a disgrace for the international community if we do not end it quickly. Aleppo is today a martyred city, and this is how it shall remain in historical memory. Thousands of children have died in bombings, entire populations are starving, humanitarian convoys are being attacked, and chemical weapons are being used.\nI have one thing to say in this regard \u2014 enough is enough. Just like in February, the ceasefire held for only a few days. It ended practically the day after its announcement, before its terms were even understood. The regime is responsible for its failure and cannot be exonerated for mistakes that could have been made by others. I would say to its foreign supporters \u2014 and we all know who they are \u2014 that they need to compel the regime\u2019s hand to peace. If they do not then they, alongside the regime, shall bear responsibility for the division and chaos in Syria.\nThe Security Council must meet as soon as possible. It should not be a theatre of fools \u2014 in other words, a place where responsibility can be evaded and where some can impede its work in order to protect a regime while they should be seeking a solution with us. France has four demands. First, we must first impose the ceasefire in line with the decisions that have been taken. That is the precondition. Secondly, we need to ensure the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Aleppo and other martyred cities. That is the priority. Thirdly, we must ensure the resumption of political negotiations along the lines of the transition established in 2012. That is the solution. Fourthly, we must sanction the use of chemical weapons. That is justice.\nIf we take these decisions and act now, there will be a solution for Syria. In fact, it will be more than a solution; there will finally be hope for refugees and displaced persons. There will finally be action that will allow Syria to maintain its territorial integrity. We are also determined to see an intervention in Iraq that will help to free the entire country from the Da\u2019esh occupation of its territory. If we decide to act effectively against terrorism, we can prevent further terrorist attacks around the world. The risk is chaos and division, and it exists beyond Syria. It also exists in Libya. Our priority must be to re-establish the State around the Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Al-Sarraj \u2014 a goal for which France is working with its partners and the United Nations.\nWe cannot sit back and do nothing. That would be playing into the hands of the forces, terrorists in particular, that aim to destabilize the world. France shall never resign itself, even if it is difficult \u2014 especially if it is difficult \u2014 and that is why it has taken the initiative to contribute to seeking a solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Of course, no one can impose a solution on the parties, but once again, resigning ourselves to the status quo involves taking a risk. It means allowing settlement to take place once again. It means once again allowing unjust, unfair and unacceptable violence to take place. The objective, therefore, is to meet here at the end of the year and hold a conference at which Israelis and Palestinians can assume their responsibilities to negotiate.\nThis same spirit led me, along with Chancellor Merkel, to seek a solution in Ukraine. It led to the creation of the Normandy format, which allowed us to come to an agreement in Minsk. Today, we must do everything we can to ensure that the agreement is implemented; if we do not, there will be renewed violence and perhaps even the resumption of war. I recall that this conflict has claimed more than 6,000 victims. I have therefore taken the initiative, along with the Chancellor of Germany, to bring together the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents in the weeks to come to promote progress in the implementation of the Minsk accords.We will not abandon that goal. We will renounce no initiative that we think may be useful.\nI have raised the issue of terrorism, which threatens every country of the world. Long is the list of all those whom it has impacted in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and even Oceania. No country can claim to be immune to the threat of Islamist terrorism, fundamentalism and fanaticism, which have seduced and radicalized lost individuals within our societies. There is no sea or wall that can protect a country from this tragedy and the scourge of terrorist action, attacks or aggressions. Terrorism thrives on open conflicts that have remained unsolved for too long. It has provoked a wave of refugees and undermined international order, borders that we thought fixed, law that we thought we could maintain and the collective security that was the very principle of the United Nations.\nIn the face of these dangers, France once again turns to the United Nations. The United Nations has shown its effectiveness with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which many thought was impossible. United Nations peacekeeping operations have never been as numerous as they are now.\nHowever, if we want to act to eradicate terrorism, we will need to make decisions and not merely talk of solidarity when a friendly country is attacked or merely express compassion for the victims. We must shoulder responsibilities whenever that can be useful. That is what France does. Not because it is attacked \u2014 today, as I have said, every country is a target for terrorism. No, France does it because it is a permanent member of the Security Council and its role is about acting, not creating obstacles. France does it because it has one great idea, the idea that it has upheld throughout its history \u2014 bringing freedom, democracy and justice to the world. It is because France puts its policies at the service of a single goal \u2014 peace \u2014 and talks to everyone involved. It is because France is an independent nation that respects the law and has no enemies other than the forces of hatred and intolerance that use a betrayed religion to create fear. It is because we must fight the populists who exploit distress in order to divide, separate, stigmatize and pit religions against one another, risking confrontations that would have terrible consequences for cohesion in our societies. France is a secular country that proclaims itself as such but that speaks to every religion and guarantees freedom of worship on its soil, because the only interests we have in the world are stability, development and the future of our planet.\nThat is why France is so committed to the United Nations and demonstrates it every day. I want to pay tribute to the President of the General Assembly, to all who dedicate themselves to the United Nations, beginning with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who for 10 years has led this difficult mission on behalf of all of us and enabled us to advance its cause. And that is also why, in the face of the major challenges I have mentioned, especially Syria and the fight against terrorism, I expect the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities. There comes a moment for every generation and public official when the only question worth asking is whether we have made decisions \u2014 and whether they are good decisions. The countries here are all different sizes, at different levels of development and with different sensitivities and beliefs, but they should have only one goal and one demand, which is that the world should rise to the challenges facing the planet.\nThat is why I want to appeal to all those here \u2014 to call for implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, for ensuring that Africa and all Africans have electricity and better development, and for peace in Syria, because it is so urgently needed. That is why I believe in the United Nations, and that is why both France and I are sending a universal message.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by extending the hearty congratulations of the delegation of Mali to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and on his outstanding stewardship of our work. I would like to assure him of our full cooperation in those efforts. I would also like to acknowledge and commend the excellent work of his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\nWe cannot but pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as he prepares to pass the torch after 10 years\nentirely dedicated to the cause of humankind. History will remember not only the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to resolve many conflicts throughout the world, but also his personal involvement in the success of the summits on climate change and humanitarian action, the former having led to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. More particularly, I would like now, in this Hall, to thank the Secretary-General for his strong support of the Malian people and his laudable efforts in favour of peace and stability in my country and the Sahel region.\nPeace and security are the conditions sine qua non of progress and development, to which we aspire on behalf of the peoples of the United Nations, whom we have the honour of representing here. With respect to Mali, one year ago, before the General Assembly, I presented the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers process, which was signed in Bamako between the Government of Mali and the armed movements in the northern region of the country (see A/70/PV.15). Today, 15 months later, from this rostrum, I can assure the Assembly that hostilities have effectively ceased between the Government and the signatory movements. To date, significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Peace Agreement, which eloquently demonstrates my Government\u2019s will to honour its commitments and has generated tangible progress in all areas.\nAt regular intervals throughout the year, when the reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Mali are published, the Government of Mali has briefed the Security Council on its progress in the execution of the plan of action for implementing the Peace Agreement.\nAmong the initiatives and actions undertaken by the Government, I would particularly like to emphasize those related to political and institutional reforms, as well as to defence and security issues. Indeed, these issues and reforms are fundamental and have an impact on the rest of the process.\nIt is also important to note the following policy and institutional reforms: the appointment and swearing in of governors in the new regions of Taoudenni and M\u00e9naka, where delegated project-management agreements for construction and equipment for the two regions\u2019 general administration, in the amounts of $1.7 million and $1.36 million, respectively, were signed; and the enactment of the law establishing the interim administrations, which followed a modification of the law codifying territorial authorities and the adoption of a decree on modalities for swearing in interim administrations. In that connection, I would like to mention that the timetable for the swearing in of the interim authorities, developed by the Malian Government in cooperation with the groups and movements signatory to the Peace Agreement, was set for between 15 July and 25 August 2016. Unfortunately, due to ongoing insecurity and clashes among some armed groups, especially in Kidal, it was not possible to complete the process for the deadline. In that respect, I emphasize that the effective implementation of Security Council resolution 2295 (2016) will allow for the progressive recovery of Mali\u2019s sovereignty throughout its territory, thanks to implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali.\nWith respect to security and defence issues, the Government of Mali has established an institutional framework for reforming the security sector and for undertaking the process of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and resettlement (DDRR). In that context, among other things, the Government decided to take charge of the signatory groups\u2019 combatants prior to the launch of the DDRR process, with the attendant increase in the budget. The Government also created an operational coordination mechanism for vehicles for the purposes of setting up the first joint vehicle patrols. I hasten to note that, in addition to those measures, which aim to bring about a return to lasting peace and the restoration of State authority throughout the national territory, the Government has continued its development activities on the ground, in places where the security conditions allowed it, through the implementation of sector projects and programmes.\nIt should also be noted that the effective implementation of the Peace Agreement requires us to mobilize external resources to support national efforts. In that regard, I thank the partners that have honoured their financial commitments to Mali, and I would reiterate the call of my Government to the technical and financial partners to release the resources pledged at the international conference for the economic recovery and development of Mali, held in Paris on 22 October 2015.\nDespite the efforts by the signatories to the Peace Agreement, the peace process still faces serious challenges related to the activities of terrorist groups in the northern regions that are indiscriminately expanding their asymmetrical attacks against peaceful civilians, the Malian defence and security forces, and the troops of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and of the French-led Operation Barkhane. I reiterate my gratitude to the Security Council for the adoption of resolution 2295 (2016), which renewed MINUSMA\u2019s mandate and authorized, inter alia, the adoption of a more proactive and robust posture so as to fulfil its stabilization mandate in Mali.\nI call for strengthening the operational capabilities of the deployed troops in order to ensure the safety and security of MINUSMA personnel and apply the innovations set forth in resolution 2295 (2016) on the ground. I would also stress the need to accelerate the process of cantonment and DDRR, aimed at isolating the armed groups that are not signatories to the Peace Agreement that are affiliated with terrorist networks whose actions undermine ongoing efforts.\nFor its part, the Government of Mali will fully assume its responsibility under the new mandate. The Government is already working with MINUSMA to swiftly arrive at a shared vision of the implementation of the mandate by establishing measurable benchmarks. Accordingly, I welcome the agreement among all the stakeholders participating in high-level meeting on Mali held this morning concerning the importance of accelerating the implementation of the Peace Agreement, in particular the imperative of correcting the remaining gaps in MINUSMA\u2019s operational capabilities.\nI cannot end this part of my address without expressing once again the sincere thanks and profound gratitude of the people of Mali for the United Nations and its Member States in providing multifaceted support for the peace process in Mali since January 2012. On behalf of a grateful Malian nation, I would also like to pay tribute to the memory of all of the victims, both civilian and military, Malian and foreign, who have fallen on the field of honour in Mali in the defence of human dignity, freedom and democracy.\nIt is difficult to imagine the eradication of poverty and keeping our promise to leave no one behind in a context where armed conflict has become a new normal. The proliferation of attacks perpetrated around the world is a sufficient reminder that no country is immune to terrorism and that there is no cause that justifies deliberate violence against innocent civilians. Mali, which unfortunately continues to suffer the horrors of terrorism, encourages and joins Member States in their shared efforts to neutralize the hydra of terrorism and its avatars, including Da\u2019esh, Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, Ansar Eddine, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in Western Africa and Al-Mourabitoun, especially in the Middle East and Africa.\nThe Malian delegation welcomes the choice of the theme of this session \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. As the first session of the Assembly since the adoption of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the Heads of State and Government, the seventy-first session will undoubtedly allow us to take stock of a full year of efforts to implement the Agenda, by conducting a thorough analysis of the difficulties met with a view to finding the best ways and means to ensure the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals, exhort us to go further and faster, if we want to put an end to all forms of poverty and change the lives of people in a substantial and inclusive manner by 2030.\nWe in Mali are convinced of the need to adopt strategies that strengthen economic growth and respond to the vital needs of the population, including combating climate change, protecting the environment and providing education, health care, social protection and jobs for young people, while also empowering women and ensuring their involvement and that of young people in the management of critical issues relating to the socioeconomic development of the country. In that context, we have adopted a law setting aside 30 per cent of elective positions for women. The adoption of that law will undoubtedly contribute to increasing the participation of women in national institutions. In addition to other equally important measures, the development of the strategic framework for economic recovery and sustainable development for the period 2016-2018 will serve, in the medium term, as the sole reference point for the design, implementation and monitoring of different development policies and strategies at a sectoral level.\nClimate change is one of the major challenges affecting the survival and development of humankind. As a prime example of a country of the Sahel, Mali is bearing the brunt of the effects of climate change. That is why the delegation of Mali welcomes the strong commitment on the part of the international community in adopting and signing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which marks a decisive turning point in the preservation of the environment. In that regard, I am particularly pleased to announce that this very morning Mali deposited its instruments of ratification for the Paris Agreement, the implementation of which I am convinced will contribute to saving our environment.\nNow more than ever, it is high time that the recourse to weapons and deadly conflicts give way to the imperative of dialogue in order to establish lasting peace throughout the world. In Africa, despite the remarkable progress that has been made in the promotion of peace and security \u2014 particularly in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 the fact remains that the situations in Libya and South Sudan continue to be of major concern. In the Middle East, we are following with the utmost concern the developments in the situations in Syria, Turkey and Iraq \u2014 and we reaffirm our strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nOn the question of Palestine, which has been at the heart of United Nations concerns for more than 70 years, Mali reiterates its call for a two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. I take this opportunity to reiterate that the people and the Government of Mali extend their solidarity and full support to their brother people in Palestine in their legitimate fight to exercise their inalienable right to sovereignty.\nI would like to conclude by reminding the Assembly that it is our primary responsibility as world leaders to provide the necessary impetus to transform the planet and to ensure sustainable and inclusive development for future generations so as to safeguard them from the scourge of war and misery. Millions of men, women and children are impatiently waiting for us, scanning the horizon with hope. We have no right to disappoint them. To that end, Mali is determined to play its role to the full extent of its abilities. Long live the United Nations at the service of a world for peace and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "We congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We agree that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should be the focus of the session. We also pay tribute to Mr. Lykketoft for his able stewardship of the seventieth session.\nToday, three decades after the end of the Cold War, our multipolar world is more free and vibrant, yet still chaotic and turbulent; more interdependent, but more unequal; more prosperous, yet still afflicted by poverty. We see spectacular progress, but also unprecedented human suffering. The world is at a historic inflection point. The international order established after the Second World War is passing away, but a new order has yet to emerge. Competition between the major Powers is becoming more confrontational. This can pose serious threats to peace across Asia. A new cold war threatens to engulf Europe, where the momentum towards greater union has already been reversed. Barricades and walls are going up, especially against the tide of misery flowing out of a turbulent Middle East. In many countries, intolerance has revived the ghosts of xenophobia and Islamophobia.\nTurmoil is intensifying in the Middle East. International efforts to defeat Da\u2019esh are therefore urgent. For this, it is essential to reconcile the divergent objectives and priorities of regional and external Powers. Peace cannot be built when injustice prevails. The long- festering tragedy of Palestine demands determined action on the part of the international community.\nAfter decades of strong growth, the world economy has reached a plateau. Yet despite the adverse international economic environment, in the past three years my Government has moved the country towards robust growth. We have fully integrated the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into our own economic and social strategy, based on our conviction that people are the true wealth of our nation and that human development will determine our future destiny.\nOur priority goal of economic development requires internal peace and stability. My country has been the principal victim of terrorism in our world, including terrorism supported, sponsored and financed from abroad. We will not allow externally sponsored terrorism and threats of destabilization to cause turbulence in Pakistan. Tens of thousands of our citizens and thousands of our security personnel have been killed or injured in terrorist attacks. That has only reinforced our resolve to eliminate the scourge of terrorism. Our comprehensive strategy of law enforcement and targeted military operations has produced remarkable results and enabled Pakistan to turn the tide against terrorists. Our Zarb-e-Azb operation is the largest, most robust and most successful anti-terrorism campaign anywhere in the world, deploying 200,000 of our security forces. Our comprehensive national action plan is fully endorsed by our people and our Parliament as well as by our security forces, all of whom have made heroic sacrifices to defeat terrorism.\nTerrorism, however, is now a global phenomenon that must be addressed comprehensively and in all its forms, including State terrorism. The international community must coordinate its efforts if we are to accomplish that. Such efforts should be approached collectively, not through the unilateral enactment of laws with extraterritorial provisions that target certain countries. We will not win the fight against terrorism and violent extremism if we do not address their root causes. They lie in poverty and ignorance, political and social injustice and oppression, foreign intervention and occupation and denial of the legitimate rights of peoples and nations, especially the right to self-determination. Until those underlying causes are addressed, it will be difficult to counter the twisted narrative of violent extremists and terrorists.\nAfter 15 years of the current war in Afghanistan, the international community agrees that the only road to a lasting peace in that country is through a dialogue between the Government in Kabul and the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan has long proposed this as the most viable way to end the decades of conflict and suffering in Afghanistan. Based on that belief in a negotiated peace, and in response to requests from President Ashraf Ghani, we have been facilitating the process of reconciliation in Afghanistan. There have been setbacks, but they are not a sufficient reason to abandon the path of peace and rely on the military option, which for the past decade and a half has failed to stabilize Afghanistan. Progress will be assured only when the Afghan parties themselves conclude that there is no military solution to the war and begin to work assiduously, through a meaningful dialogue process, to achieve reconciliation and peace at home.\nMore than three and a half decades of conflict and chaos in Afghanistan have had grave security and economic consequences for Pakistan. Almost 3 million Afghan refugees, to whom we have opened our homes and hearts, remain in Pakistan. We hope to see them return home voluntarily and with dignity. Until they do, the international community must shoulder its responsibility for helping to sustain them.\nConfrontation should not be our destiny in South Asia. Pakistan wants peace with India and we have gone the extra mile to achieve it, repeatedly offering to hold a dialogue to address all outstanding issues. But India has posed unacceptable preconditions for engaging in dialogue. Let us be clear that talks are not some special favour for Pakistan. They are in the interest of both countries. They are essential to resolving our differences, especially in the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and to averting the danger of any escalation.\nPeace and normalization between Pakistan and India cannot be achieved without a resolution of the Kashmir dispute. That is an objective evaluation, not a partisan position. Our predictions have now been confirmed by events. A new generation of Kashmiris has risen spontaneously against India, demanding freedom from its illegal occupation. The young leader Burhan Wani, murdered by Indian forces, has emerged as a symbol of the latest Kashmiri intifada, a popular and peaceful freedom movement led by Kashmiris young and old, men and women, armed only with undying faith in the legitimacy of their cause and a hunger for freedom in their hearts.\nAs usual, the indigenous Kashmiri uprising has been met with brutal repression by India\u2019s occupation force of more than half a million soldiers. More than a hundred Kashmiris have been killed; hundreds, including children and infants, have been blinded by shotgun pellets; and more than 6,000 unarmed civilians have been injured over the past two months.\nThe Indian brutalities are well documented. I would like to inform the General Assembly that Pakistan will share with the Secretary-General a dossier containing detailed information and evidence of the gross and systematic violations of human rights committed by Indian forces in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The brutalities will not suppress the Kashmiris\u2019 spirits; they will only intensify their anger and fortify their determination to see India end its occupation of Kashmir. From Srinagar to Sopore, the men, women and children come out each day, defying a curfew, to demand freedom.\nPakistan fully supports the demand of the Kashmiri people for self-determination, as several Security Council resolutions have promised them. Their struggle is a legitimate one for liberation from alien occupation. International law and the declarations of the United Nations on self-determination give them the right to struggle for their freedom. Every year, the General Assembly unanimously adopts a resolution that reaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination and calls on the States concerned to immediately end their occupation and all acts of repression.\nOn behalf of the Kashmiri people; on behalf of the mothers and fathers of the innocent Kashmiri children; on behalf of women and men who have been killed,\nblinded and injured; on behalf of the Pakistani nation, I demand an independent inquiry into the extrajudicial killings and a United Nations fact-finding mission to investigate brutalities perpetrated by the Indian occupying forces so that those guilty of such atrocities are punished. We demand the immediate release of all Kashmiri political prisoners, an end to the curfew, freedom for the Kashmiris to demonstrate peacefully, urgent medical help for the injured and abrogation of India\u2019s draconian laws.\nThe Security Council has called for the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Jammu and Kashmir through a free and fair plebiscite, held under United Nations auspices. The people of Kashmir have waited 70 years for the implementation of that promise. The Security Council must honour its commitments by implementing its own decisions. The General Assembly must demand that India deliver on the commitments its leaders solemnly made on many occasions.\nTo that end, steps should be taken by the United Nations to demilitarize Jammu and Kashmir and undertake consultations with India, Pakistan and the true representatives of the Kashmiri people to implement the resolutions of the Security Council. In that context, we welcome the offer of his good offices by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We will also open consultations with members of the Security Council to explore the modalities for the implementation of the relevant Council resolutions on Kashmir.\nThe international community ignores the danger of rising tensions in South Asia at its own peril. For its part, Pakistan is committed to the establishment of strategic stability in the region. It neither wants nor is engaged in an arms race with India. But we cannot ignore our neighbour\u2019s unprecedented arms build-up, and we will take whatever measures are necessary to maintain credible deterrence. We have consistently urged the conclusion of bilateral arms control and disarmament measures between Pakistan and India to prevent conflict and avoid wasteful military expenditures.\nWe are open to discussing all measures of restraint and responsibility with India in any forum or format and without any conditions. We are ready for talks to agree on a bilateral nuclear test ban treaty. Today, from this rostrum, I would also like to reiterate our offer to India to enter into a serious and sustained dialogue for the peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, especially Jammu and Kashmir.\nAs a responsible nuclear-weapon State, Pakistan will continue to cooperate with all international efforts that seek to promote fair and equitable solutions to disarmament and non-proliferation challenges. We have introduced state-of-the-art measures to strengthen the safety and security of our nuclear materials and facilities. We have adopted a comprehensive export control regime that is fully consistent with international standards. Judged on the basis of objective criteria and without discrimination, Pakistan is fully eligible for membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\nIn our turbulent and interdependent world, the United Nations remains an indispensable organization in terms of restoring order and ensuring global peace, stability and prosperity. Its principles remain the crucial pillars of international legality, the guide for the conduct of Member States and the guarantor of the legitimate rights of all nations and peoples. The United Nations must regain its credibility as the central instrument for the promotion of peace, prosperity and liberty. To that end, it should become more representative, transparent and accountable. A comprehensive and democratic reform of the Security Council, which Pakistan supports, should enhance its relevance and representation. Creating new centres of privilege will do the opposite.\nPakistan\u2019s unwavering commitment to the United Nations is well established. We have played a pioneering and consistent role in United Nations peacekeeping. Despite our own security requirements, we will remain one of the world\u2019s largest troop-contributing countries and maintain our record of success in multiple United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nPakistan has a vital stake in ending conflicts, fostering peace, fighting terrorism, strengthening democracy, promoting human rights, generating global growth and overcoming the challenges of environmental degradation. We can achieve those goals and create a new and peaceful world order, solely through the United Nations and with strict adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I am confident that his wisdom, leadership and experience will guide our session to success. Allow me also to thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President at the seventieth session, for his important contributions to the work of the Assembly. My special gratitude extends to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership, commitment, tireless efforts and tremendous contributions during his ten years at the helm of the Organization.\nLast year, 2015, we established a common vision for the world we live in. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction not only seek to address short-term challenges, but also to present a vision for greater partnership for people, the planet, peace and prosperity. The theme chosen for this session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, is therefore very opportune as we embark upon realizing our vision and turning our commitments into concrete results for our people.\nI believe that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is within our grasp. Our people, our children and grandchildren, expect us to deliver on our commitments. The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has laid a solid foundation. Opportunities are plenty. Reform, innovation, creativity and economic restructuring are setting countries on a path to prosperity. The internationalization of production is making possible global and regional cooperation and integration for sustainable development. New advances in science and technology are paving the way for the fourth Industrial Revolution, which promises to bring humanity to a new, higher level of development.\nBut challenges are by no means few. Developing countries in particular continue to suffer from the weak global economic recovery, rising protectionism in major economies, climate change, natural disasters and epidemics. Food and water security, the depletion of natural resources, and the humanitarian and migration crises also have negative and far-reaching implications for many countries and regions. Development and income gaps are widening at the national, regional and global levels. The instability and tension, violence, conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism that are plaguing many regions are of particular concern. Power politics and the use, or threat of use, of force in international relations continue to be a threat to international peace and security.\nThat is the reality of our world today, and it compels us to work together to promote multilateralism and adherence to international law for peace, cooperation and sustainable development. As has been demonstrated, multilateral cooperation has a growing role to play in international relations. We are seeing multilateral institutions expand, both in numbers and in strength. Multi-tiered cooperation and integration are taking shape. Multilateral solutions to common challenges prove to be the most effective and long-lasting, since no country, large or small, rich or poor, can afford to address those challenges alone. Multilateral institutions are also venues for countries to promote their interests, effectively manage disputes and differences and expand their development opportunities.\nThat is why Viet Nam believes that multilateralism must be strengthened and the operation of multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations, must be improved. The United Nations has an indispensable role to play by coordinating international responses to global challenges and facilitating development cooperation. No other organization is better at fostering partnerships and assisting countries to successfully implement the SDGs.\nAccordingly, to ensure greater equality, democracy and transparency, the United Nations, including the Security Council, must undergo reform. The United Nations development system must have better resources and be more effective and efficient. We must ensure the broadest participation of all countries in discussions and formulations of resolutions and decisions, so that no country will be left behind.\nInternational law remains the linchpin of a stable international security architecture and a strong multilateral system. Unfortunately, the role of the fundamental norms and principles of international law is underestimated. Unfair demands, unilateralism, power politics and the use of force to address international security and political issues have been creating tensions and confrontation, hindering efforts to peacefully settle disputes and conflicts.\nThis is where the United Nations can and must play a stronger part. The Organization must take the lead in promoting adherence to international law and the Charter of the United Nations as the foundation for international peace and security. No country, big or small, can be exempt from the law. The United Nations should also work to strengthen preventive diplomacy and the peaceful settlement of disputes, utilizing all tools, as provided in Article 33 of the Charter.\nAbove all, I believe that each country should align its national interests with those of humankind and immerse itself in the community of nations. A policy of humanity, peace and friendship will enable us to eliminate hatred, narrow gaps, manage differences and open up opportunities to find lasting solutions to all disputes and conflicts. Having suffered from decades of war, Viet Nam treasures peace and will spare no effort to maintain or achieve peace. We believe lasting peace can be secured only by long-term vision and a comprehensive and inclusive approach that harmonizes\n16-29811 19/52 the interests of all stakeholders. We welcome recent positive developments in the relations between Cuba and the United States and support resolutions on ending the economic embargo against Cuba.\nMultilateralism, international law, peace, cooperation and development are the key elements for building a peaceful, stable and prosperous Asia- Pacific region. Regional countries are working to promote initiatives for political, economic, social and cultural cooperation and integration, including new- generation free trade areas. However, the Asia-Pacific region contains risks of conflict, especially on the Korean peninsula and in the South China Sea \u2014 all and any of which can threaten regional and international peace, security and prosperity. With regard to certain recent complicated developments in the South China Sea, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise self-restraint and solve disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, fully respect diplomatic and legal processes, implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the completion of the code of conduct for the South China Sea.\nViet Nam is strongly committed to the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A plan of action for the implementation of the SDGs has been developed, and we are working with United Nations agencies to craft the strategic plan 2017-2021, as part of the Delivering as One initiative, to assist Viet Nam in the implementation of the SDGs. For us, implementing the SDGs is part of and also encompasses our efforts to restructure the economy and transform the growth model, develop sustainable infrastructure, ensure social justice, address inequalities and protect the environment. As one of the countries predicted to be hardest hit by climate change and sea-level rise, Viet Nam is expediting procedures for the early ratification of the Paris Agreement and is planning its implementation.\nExperience has shown that success comes only when we take our development into our own hands. To transform the world, we must start with transforming ourselves and leave no one behind. Viet Nam believes it essential to bring its domestic resources into full play and mainstream sustainability into our development vision, strategies and policies, with the people at the centre. We also believe that we can succeed only with stronger global partnerships, in which the United Nations plays the convening and coordinating role. Viet Nam calls on developed countries to uphold their responsibility to take the lead in assisting developing countries, including Viet Nam, to realize the SDGs, especially in financing, capacity-building, technology transfer and trade facilitation.\nAs a peace-loving and friendly nation, Viet Nam always pursues the foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development. We strive to be a friend, a reliable partner and a responsible member of the international community. Our commitment to multilateralism and international law is unwavering, and we will spare no effort to contribute to peace, cooperation and development.\nViet Nam has decided to present its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2020-2021 and will continue to increase its participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operations. Viet Nam looks forward to stronger partnership and collaboration with the United Nations and Member States to realize the vision of transforming our world and ensuring a better future.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to thank our Lord, who has watched over us on our journey and enabled us to be here for this important meeting of the United Nations.\nOn behalf of Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, and of the entire Burundian people, I would like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, a worthy son of Fiji, on his election on 13 June to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. He will always be able to count on Burundi\u2019s full cooperation during his tenure. I also commend\n16-29817 13/34 Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his excellent work in presiding with brio over the seventieth session, which he brought to a delightful close on 13 September.\nI would also like to reiterate our confidence in Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Burundi will cooperate fully with him during the remainder of his term and wishes him health, happiness and every success in his future work. We would also like to convey our best wishes to the new Secretary-General, who will be starting at a very important moment for the world.\nRegarding the inter-Burundian dialogue, the Government of Burundi has participated in every meeting held at the invitation of the facilitator of the East African Community (EAC). I would like to inform the Assembly that on 8 September, the facilitator, Mr. Benjamin Mkapa, former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, presented his report to the EAC summit, calling for a renewed commitment on the part of all stakeholders to engaging in the EAC-led dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Burundi is of the view that the dialogue should not replace or undermine the democratic tenets of the country\u2019s Constitution, while it reaffirms its commitment to the dialogue, as expressed at the last EAC summit.\nWe believe that peaceful political stakeholders, in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolutions 2248 (2015) and 2279 (2016), are welcome to discuss the future of Burundi. By the same token, and with a view to opening up to greater inclusivity, our national commission for inter-Burundian dialogue has submitted its report on six months of discussions with Burundians from all walks of life, from grassroots communities to the upper echelons of society. Our citizens have called for a number of major reforms for improving Burundi\u2019s stability that cannot be ignored, and the Government has taken note of them.\nI stand before the Assembly today to reiterate Burundi\u2019s unwavering commitment to human rights. A well-regarded national commission and fully fledged ministerial department are in charge of human rights, and we should support them. The Government wishes to reaffirm its commitment to ensuring the security of all our citizens, regardless of their ethnic origin. None of the three ethnic groups is above the others, nor is any group a pariah. As established in our Constitution, all our citizens have equal opportunities.\nCurrently in Burundi, we are working to consolidate security gains in the face of numerous actors with only one goal \u2014 regime change \u2014 and whose methods are uniformly violent. It is crucial to ensure great caution in assessing the situation. The fact is that rumors, false information and social media, have all been used to portray Burundi in a bad light. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to categorically reject the deliberattely politically exaggerated reports of alleged human rights violations in Burundi. Some cases have been taken out of context and others blown out of proportion, with no mention of the security personnel who have been killed while on duty. The report I refer to (A/HRC/32/30) is marred by its controversial selection of victims, while the method of collecting testimony through WhatsApp messages is a departure from United Nations practices. Our Government will take the opportunity to present a comprehensive counter- report in Geneva in the next few days.\nOn the other hand, Burundi would like to reiterate its openness to the African Union\u2019s human rights monitors and military experts. The financial and structural challenges that the African Union Commission is dealing with, which have stalled the generation of the necessary personnel, are not our fault. Regarding the memorandum of understanding between Burundi and the Commission, my Government calls on the Commission to uphold fully and in good faith the terms of the agreement reached in Bujumbura during the meeting in February of the six African Union Heads of State and Government.\nRegarding Security Council resolution 2303 (2016), adopted under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, Burundi was shocked by the lack of consensus and the surprise manner in which it was adopted. While the consultations before the adoption did not result in full approval of the penholder\u2019s proposal, some Council members thought that Burundi\u2019s consent should be obtained before creating a fait accompli. Resolutions under Chapter VI of the Charter are predicated on the consent of the Government concerned.\nWhere the humanitarian situation is concerned, our Government has made the return of refugees a priority. We are aware of the extremely difficult conditions they are living in, mostly in neighbouring countries, and we will spare no effort to enable every one of them to return home. We have guaranteed the security of their goods and property, and around 90,000 refugees have voluntarily returned home over the past four months.\nI would like to urge all our neighbours to help to facilitate their voluntary repatriation. The Government of the Republic of Burundi is in discussions with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on launching tripartite negotiations with the host countries.\nAlso in line with the relevant provisions of resolutions 2248 (2015) and 2279 (2016), and in order to comply with the 2013 Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, the Government of the Republic of Burundi calls on all its neighbours to refrain from aiding and abetting the violent schemes of some groups, especially those that failed in their bid on 13 May 2015 to overthrow Burundi\u2019s democratic institutions and attacked us on 10 July 2015. The report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (S/2016/466), submitted to the Security Council a few months ago, is comprehensive and clear on the activities of those groups, which have attacked Burundi more than once, and my Government urges the Council to act on those findings.\nRegarding United Nations reform, Africa, along with other regions of the world, has called for reform of our Organization\u2019s bodies, particularly the Security Council, again and again. Decision 62/557 paved the way for instituting negotiations on reform. As countless delegations have pointed out, it is absolutely unacceptable that, more than seven decades after its creation, our Organization is still functioning with the same post-war mindset, with a few Members claiming more rights than the rest. The Government of the Republic of Burundi fully supports the African Union position outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus.\nOur Organization needs a new impetus. However, there are some steps that can be taken even before that goal is reached. For instance, the three African non-permanent members of the Council should be given more responsibilities and allowed to work independently. If more than 70 per cent of the situations under consideration by the Council originate in Africa, it is not too much to ask that the so-called penholders be African countries, especially in light of the sometimes biased views of Africa entertained by some Council members.\nThe shock and horror of the images we have seen of migrants seeking refuge in Europe are a constant reminder to all of us that while the world we live in may be one of shared opportunities it is also one of shared challenges. While we call on countries of destination to demonstrate more humanity in catering to migrants, we believe it is important to analyse the deep- rooted causes of such mass exoduses of the young men, women and children who find it necessary to risk their lives on the open sea in search of better opportunities. One way of reducing the problem is by supporting well- intentioned development programmes undertaken by the countries of the South. As their social and economic situation improves, more people will find reasons to stay in their own countries, but that can happen only if we all understand that we must respect the political, social, economic and cultural fabric of every country. Unfortunately, that is not always the case today.\nThis year\u2019s general debate is taking place at a time when terrorism is affecting the entire world and has hit every region. Some progress has been made, but we have to recognize the fact that efforts to develop a common strategy have not yet yielded the hoped-for results. Terrorist attacks have shaken countries in every corner of the world and touched all of us. My country is concerned about the surge in such attacks, and my Government, as always, condemns terrorism in all its manifestations and sympathizes with its victims. We believe that we must wage the fight against terrorism with greater determination.\nMatching its words with deeds, Burundi has been sending troops to fight terrorism and violent extremism in many parts of the world since 2007. More than 5,000 Burundian troops are in Somalia fighting Al-Shabaab as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Our continued presence there is proof of Burundi\u2019s firm commitment to combating terrorism, in full solidarity with our brothers and sisters on the continent and beyond. We believe that the fight against terrorism anywhere is a contribution to global peace.\nDespite the fact that two formed police units from Burundi were not rotated into the Central African Republic for politically motivated reasons, we remain committed to peace and security, and our men and women in uniform are still prepared to serve in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic with the same zeal that has been shown by our police units in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Haiti and Darfur. Our only interest is in helping our brothers and sisters to recover their dignity and freedom. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the partners that have continued to support such missions. As a troop-contributing country, Burundi urges the United Nations to fill the gap left by the cuts in the European Union\u2019s budget for AMISOM.\nBurundi has also participated in other initiatives, such as the European Union action plan on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security, aimed at preventing terrorist groups and non-State actors from acquiring substances that could be used for terrorist purposes. However, none of those initiatives can help us defeat terrorism if structural causes such as inequality and poverty are not dealt with. People need to be able to put bread on the table.\nMy delegation would like to note here how essential it is that all Member States incorporate the 17 Sustainable Development Goals into the design of their policies, programmes and budgets. For its part, Burundi is committed to putting its citizens at the centre of its development policies. With its partners\u2019 valuable support, the Government of Burundi is working to respond to the needs of its most vulnerable citizens as inclusively as possible. We are working together with every country on the planet to promote and implement a sustainable, durable regime on climate, as well as a legally binding instrument, and we must make sure we consolidate the gains achieved on that epoch-making day of 21 December 2015. In a few months, Burundi will join those countries that have already ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nOn 13 October 1961 in Bujumbura, our then Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Louis Rwagasore, the hero of our independence, was assassinated by elements close to the colonial administration as he presided over his first and last cabinet meeting. On 15 January 1965, Pierre Ngendandumwe, our Prime Minister, was gunned down in Bujumbura by a local embassy staffer. On 21 October 1993, Melchior Ndadaye, the first democratically elected President of Burundi, was assassinated by army troops from one ethnic group. On 13 May 2015, a bid to overthrow Burundi\u2019s legitimate institutions failed. What all those sad events have in common, however, is the unhealthy and obvious involvement of foreign elements. And we should not forget that President Ntaryamira died in a foreign land when the plane carrying him and the then-President of Rwanda was shot down on 6 April 1994.\nIn that regard, it is important to remember that African societies are highly complex. What Burundi is asking for is to be seen fairly, on its own terms, not through the lenses of other situations in other countries. We do not welcome any kind of foreign interference in our affairs, because Burundi has been flying the flag of a sovereign State since 1 July 1962, however difficult that may be for some to understand.\nThree communities live in our beautiful land, bordered on the west by majestic Lake Tanganyika, the world\u2019s second deepest, and by two other countries to the north and east. The Hutu, Tutsi and Twa peoples live in harmony in Burundi and have an equal say in the affairs of Government, as provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of Burundi. No group is above or below another.\nIt is crucial to take into account the suffering and pain that our people endured as a result of bad leadership in the past. The wounds left by the massacres of the past remind us to treat all our citizens the same way, with no distinctions between classes or groups. Victims know no majority or minority \u2014 their pain is the same. We therefore refuse to manipulate or falsify history. Our citizens continue to mourn their loved ones, lost to ignorance and the barbaric practices of the military regimes that overthrew the monarchy and proclaimed a republic. For more than 40 years, the various Burundi Administrations in Burundi busied themselves segregating and killing citizens on the basis of their ethnicity.\nThe Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement of 2000 and our 2005 Constitution defined the place of all citizens in the country\u2019s administration, in what was seen to be an equitable way of ensuring peace and stability. Those tenets are still in place today, and the Arusha Agreement is fully respected in our institutions. Similarly, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission envisaged in the Arusha Agreement has now been established. We therefore call on the United Nations to support the Commission\u2019s work. The Barundi people now have a forum that can address the sad events in their history. They need to know why their nation changed from being one in which different ethnic communities lived in harmony to one in which citizens lost their lives because of their ethnic origins. The process will enable us to tap into the knowledge resources of the United Nations, which entrusted the administration of Burundi to a third country.\nLastly, our people \u2014 the Hutu, the Tutsi and the Twa \u2014 want only to live in peace and harmony. They unanimously reject genocidal rhetoric. They form one single society, one nation. They share a faith in their common future, which they want to be peaceful and prosperous, one of equal opportunity. As President Pierre Nkurunziza has said time and again, there will be no genocide in the Republic of Burundi. That is our faith and the faith of all our people. And we, the people of Burundi, will fight that evil with every possible means.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to join others in extending our heartfelt congratulations to the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. Mongolia pledges its full support to the President.\nIt is my great honour to address this body for the seventh time on behalf of the Mongolian people. I am the youngest of eight sons. For generations, my family lived as nomadic herdsmen in the western highlands of my country. My mother and father never dreamed that, one day, their youngest son would be speaking from this respected rostrum to the largest assembly in the world.\nI am proud to serve for my country in accordance with the free will of our people. Mongolia is governed by democratic rules. The President has a constitutional term limit. Therefore, my mandate ends next year. This is my last address as the President of Mongolia to the General Assembly.\nBut the people of Mongolia will continue to be citizens of the global community together with all nations. I am proud that my country is a good friend and partner of every State Member of the United Nations. I am confident that our next President will be welcomed by everyone here and will be given the same respect and the same spirit of cooperation that I have enjoyed during these years.\nAchieving sustainable development is essential. It is essential because no one in the world should be left behind and be deprived of the right to development. We must work together towards a world where everybody can have a dignified life, free from poverty, violence and depression. I firmly believe that justice, stability and security cannot be ensured without the rule of law and respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of all. Those basic principles must be respected and protected in every country and by all Governments.\nThe United Nations celebrated its seventieth anniversary at a time of turbulence. Today, we are witnessing many conflicts and terrorist attacks, which have become almost daily news headlines. The world is facing its largest-ever humanitarian crisis, involving millions of people who have been displaced from their homes. The slowdown in global growth and the rising tensions in many places have threatened further progress.\nHowever, the intervening year has been a period of inspiring collaboration as well. In some places, long- fought wars have come to an end. Peace agreements have been reached. The development of dangerous weapons has been restrained. The power of diplomacy has prevailed. Last year, all together, we launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a plan of action for people, the planet and prosperity. In December in Paris, the world turned a new page in its efforts to combat climate change.\nAs a global community, we are all following a new road map on our next 15-year journey. The 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement provide clear guidelines for achieving what we have promised to do. We must now act together as we take responsibility for our people. We must now strengthen our partnership so as to save the planet. We now need the resources to put the action plan to work.\nMongolia will ensure that no one is left behind by reaching out first to the most vulnerable. The principles and policies of the 2030 Agenda have been translated into our national strategy. The Mongolia 2030 Sustainable Development Vision of is under way. Our agenda calls for the establishment of a diverse and inclusive economic structure aimed at increasing decent jobs, providing opportunities and generating income. Our goal is to improve the quality of life and ensure environmental sustainability. Equally essential is cooperation between and among Governments, international development communities, the private sector and civil-society institutions.\nFrom our past experience in implementing the Millennium Development Goals at the national level, we learned that regular follow-up and review mechanisms will be essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, accountability and the quality of governance will eventually define the success of the SDGs.\nTomorrow, we will mark that landmark achievement on our collective journey to counter climate change. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the States parties that have formally ratified the Paris Agreement. The people of Mongolia have joined the world in its fight to mitigate climate change. We have concluded our national legislative process and recently ratified the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement represents our common success, the result of our hard work. It is also a great inspiration for all of us. It is our bold vision and promise to our children to save the world for them. And we must deliver on that promise.\nMongolia is one of smallest carbon emitters in the world, yet it suffers disproportionately from climate change. Desertification, deforestation and the loss of biodiversity have severely affected livelihoods in our traditional nomadic culture, and they spur further environmental degradation.\nMongolia is holding up its end of the bargain. But the promised international cooperation and support are still lacking. The benefits of the green funds and carbon credits are sorely missed in Mongolia and many developed countries alike. We urge multilateral institutions to take the lead in those important efforts. We have one home, one world for all of us and one universal goal, namely, to save our home. Today is our time to act. We must not miss that chance, as we must not miss our future.\nTo that end we must work for equality, inclusiveness and accountability in our Governments and societies. Our agreed Agenda calls for inclusive societies and accountable institutions. People have called for good governance and the rule of law through the 2030 Agenda. They have asked for transparency and accountability in Governments\u2019 plans and development efforts. We must be accountable in our actions and responsibilities. Accountability is a benchmark requirement for good governance. Good governance is key to global peace and prosperity. We therefore promote accountability and good governance in our society. A national law on public hearings and a policy on supporting public participation are being implemented in Mongolia.\nThe Agenda for Sustainable Development demands action against corruption. It requires that institutions function in a transparent and efficient way, based on the rule of law. Basic services must therefore be delivered without discrimination or corruption. Investors can count on stability and businesses on predictability, with clear legal frameworks, decent jobs and recourse to independent courts. It means that natural resources are harnessed to benefit the many, not the few, and the environmental impact is measured and controlled.\nDevelopment and accountability are about democracy. We should never take democracy for granted. Neither should we worship it. It must be nurtured and strengthened on a daily basis. It is our way of living and our state of mind. A democratic society is sustainable because its aim is the highest development of every one of its members.\nTherefore, our common goal as leaders should be to provide an environment where democratic institutions can thrive \u2014 the rule of law, human rights, democratic governance and free and fair elections. And we must enforce accountability. The people will do the rest in a democracy. For only in a democracy will each and every person be provided with opportunities for self- development and self-realization.\nOver the past 26 years, Mongolia has accumulated experience as a stable and peaceful democracy. It was tested again in the most recent parliamentary elections, held on 29 June. The elections were open and transparent. The newly formed Parliament and Cabinet are now responsible for the people of Mongolia. The people vested them with full power to work hard for them.\nOver the past two decades, Mongolia has been supporting and promoting stronger democratic institutions and sustainable, effective and legitimate democracy. We have been sharing our experiences and lessons learned with our fellow nations. We have been happy to learn that our lessons have helped other countries.\nFrom this podium, I wish to sincerely congratulate the people of both Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar for their successful elections held last year and to wish them sustained prosperity.\nAs one of the Chairs of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), Mongolia hosted the IDEA Annual Democracy Forum last month. At this year\u2019s Forum, the focus was on learning from democratic transitions. Experts from many countries with various democracy models shared their experiences relating to improving the modalities of elections, accountability and transparency. It was truly a knowledge-sharing and inspiring exercise. Mongolia\u2019s International Cooperation Fund, to which we are committed, will expand its activities to work together with emerging democracies.\nMongolia holds dear human rights and liberties. These days we talk all too often about human rights and the rule of law. Whether we uphold such values is tested by actual practice and implementation. The entire 2030 Agenda is centred on respect for human rights and human dignity. We, the Member States, have the primary responsibility for upholding human rights. In order to assume its responsibilities, Mongolia has started a new phase of legal reform aimed at ensuring the full protection of human rights, including the right to justice.\nMongolia has abolished the death penalty. I believe that the death penalty is neither acceptable nor justifiable under any circumstances. I believe that one day our loving human family will become free of the death penalty. I know it is not easy to exercise leadership on that tough issue. Nevertheless, as a democratic society in the East, Mongolia will spare no effort to promote human rights and human dignity.\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, Mongolia will work against any form of discrimination. Ten years ago, we, the Member States, created the Human Rights Council to put the human rights pillar back at the centre of the United Nations system. It was created to provide a space for open dialogue so as to respond to human rights emergencies. As we know all too well, human rights are, sadly, threatened around the world. Many countries fail to uphold human rights while countering terrorism. The Human Rights Council must act effectively to create a global culture based on respect for human rights and dignity for all.\nThe spread of terrorism all over the world is a grave concern for us. Terrorism is a common challenge for all of humankind. It is a common threat to national security, as well as to the global order. We all witness, almost every day, humanitarian disasters and massive human rights violations. Mongolia firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and violence. There is no justification for terrorism of any kind. The international community must be united to defeat and counter terrorism. At the same time, we should also do all we can to prevent that form of violent extremism.\nIn July this year, Mongolia successfully hosted the eleventh Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of that forum. I take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Heads of State and Government and leaders of the ASEM partner organizations for attending the Summit and contributing to its success. I am proud to report to the General Assembly that the leaders of Asia and Europe came together to chart out the future course of action for the next decade. We reaffirmed our strong determination to take joint actions to consolidate peace, security and stability. Asia and Europe stand united in our actions against terrorism, corruption and poverty. I firmly believe that ASEM multilateralism will advance global well-being and prosperity. Once again, I thank representatives for visiting my homeland for a once-in- a-century event of global magnitude.\nIn the Ulaanbaatar Declaration, the leaders of Asia and Europe sent strong messages to the people of the world about how we will work together during the next decade. We are united in contributing to sustained peace, security, stability and economic recovery and in responding to global and regional challenges in the twenty-first century. We all agreed on the key role that the United Nations should play in maintaining international peace and security.\nIt has always been a profound delight for me, as the Head of State of Mongolia, to report to the General Assembly on the successful service of Mongolian sons and daughters as Blue Helmets, who stand guard for global peace and stability. The United Nations is doing its utmost to protect civilians, end conflicts and create conditions for lasting peace. The security environment is far more complex and more dangerous than ever, and the services of United Nations peacekeepers have never been as much in demand as now.\nThe world is not yet free of wars, devastation and destitution, but we believe that there will come a day when child refugees will no longer be swept onto the shore by cold ocean tides, when children will no longer be orphaned in senseless violence and wars and when people will no longer be afraid to take peaceful strolls in the beautiful cities of Nice, Istanbul or Dhaka.\nSouth Sudan is still the youngest member of the international community. The people of South Sudan need our help and support, and we are proud that Mongolian peacekeepers, together with fellow Blue Helmets, continue to extend their helping hand to the people of South Sudan. We honour their bravery and dedication. I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound appreciation to the thousands of courageous members of international humanitarian organizations. They put their very lives at risk while saving millions from certain death and starvation. Once again, I congratulate them.\nThe demand for mediation and support and good offices for humanitarian assistance has reached an all- time high. Conflict situations must be resolved. My own region, North-East Asia, is home to many unresolved issues. The last stronghold and division of the Cold War still persists on the Korean peninsula. Any development there will have a direct impact on regional and our own security and stability. Once again, we reiterate our firm position that the Korean peninsula should be nuclear- weapon-free.\nIn order to resolve tensions and conflicts, it is crucial to eradicate mistrust among the nations concerned and to hold direct talks more often. The Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security is called upon to do exactly that: to promote trust in the region, to facilitate the exchange of ideas and to find solutions to common concerns. The task is complicated and not easy. However, every Member of the United Nations will strive for an appropriate solution.\nIn conclusion, allow me to express Mongolia\u2019s full commitment to faithfully implementing both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We must demonstrate to the world and to our nations that meaningful progress is being made on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We reaffirm our firm commitment to the multilateral system with the United Nations at its core. Let us therefore work together for the progress on global development for future generations. As always, Mongolia will play its part for the cause of peace, freedom and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring to the General Assembly greetings from my President, General Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan, who would have loved to be here but who, owing to other national commitments, has asked me to represent him at the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. Allow me to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also want to commend his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for a job well done.\nMore important, I wish to pay tribute and extend my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his global achievements and for his interest in, and attention to, South Sudan. In my culture, a white bull is a symbol of peace. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir Mayardit once gave His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon a white bull as a gesture of peace. The bull has now grown enough to be ready for delivery to the Secretary- General, to whom we wish all the best in his future endeavours.\nEvery year we try to remind ourselves of the cardinal principle of global peace. Although the theme of this year\u2019s debate is \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, we still understand that without peace we will not be able to achieve that noble objective. Indeed, we need to transform our world in order to collectively and specifically respond to the many challenges that we are facing today. Bringing human suffering to an end and ensuring that human dignity for all is achieved and respected around the world are noble goals that we must all strive to attain.\nMy country, South Sudan, which was admitted to the General Assembly five years ago, in July 2011, has once again descended into conflict. Today South Sudan has been struck by civil war because we, the leaders of the country, have failed to agree on how to address the internal challenges of governance and leadership within our political party, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement (SPLM). After nearly two years of protracted fighting, we were able to reach a decision and sign the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, in August 2015, which we are currently and steadily implementing, with support from our region\u2019s regional body, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), as well as the African Union (AU), the Troika countries \u2014 the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Norway \u2014 the European Union (EU), China and the rest of the world.\nHowever, in the course of implementing the Agreement, one of our leaders, the former Chairman of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO), triggered renewed fighting on 7 to 11 July, which brought about new instability. This time the fighting took place inside the presidential palace itself, with the primary objective of taking power by force. Fortunately, the SPLA-IO forces were defeated in the ensuing battles, and their leader decided to flee from Juba and abandon the process of implementing the August 2015 peace agreement signed in Addis Ababa. This man has resorted to fighting the very Government he served as first Vice-President.\nAfter this departure, our party, the SPLA-IO, which is the leading party to the agreement, met and agreed to replace him as a leader of SPLA-In Opposition. The official leadership of the SPLA-IO took that decision after having established that the position of the first Vice-President was vacant and that it was not an option for the country and the people to go back to war. It took this decision in order to allow peace and stability to prevail in the country, as well as for the SPLA-IO to have a partner in the implementation of the peace agreement. To that end, a new leader for SPLA-IO was elected. Accordingly, I am here representing my country as its first Vice-President. We are determined this time \u2014 more than before \u2014 to move our country forward in peace and development with a view to averting the suffering of our people.\nAt this point, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the United Nations for the humanitarian assistance it has rendered, and continues to render, to our people. I would like also to thank IGAD, the AU, the troika, the United Nations, the EU and China for their tireless efforts in ensuring that an agreement was reached to end the conflict and return South Sudan to a peaceful and stable path.\nAt the moment, I can report to the members of the Assembly with confidence that the situation in my country is stable and peaceful, my Government is functioning and life is returning to normal. The Transitional National Legislative Assembly is operational. Furthermore, it has been reconstituted and is continuing with its work, and cantonment areas for armies have been established. However, the effect of the conflict, coupled with the low global oil prices, has put our economy under unprecedented fiscal stress, thus creating hardship for the general public. Nevertheless, together with our development partners and friends, we are making every effort to address the economic shocks by stabilizing the security situation, streamlining our fiscal policies, improving income from non-oil revenue, engaging in agricultural, mining, tourism, including ecotourism, activities, and encouraging investors to come to South Sudan.\nAnother important milestone is that South Sudan and the Sudan are now moving quickly to ensure the reconciliation of the two States and that their relations are normalized, so that the two States are able to better serve their citizens. There shall be no more harbouring of negative forces from either country. The Sudan and South Sudan are also working closely with other countries in our region \u2014 especially Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda \u2014 to realize the vision of sustainable development by building infrastructure, such as power grids and roads, in order to improve the lives of citizens.\nMore often than not, we have taken decisions individually, and sometimes collectively, to try to address such situations as preventing a country from slipping into conflict, while urging reforms and democratization, promoting respect for human rights and so on. But sometimes the results of such actions may actually contribute to the very things we were trying to avoid in the first place.\nSome leaders who may not agree with those efforts assert that those actions are unhelpful. The point I am trying to make in this regard is that efforts in some of our countries, which we are taken with the supposed intention of protecting civilians, advancing democracy and promoting respect for human rights and justice, have not always produced the intended results. Rather, in most cases, we end up causing displacement and refugees. I have the inclination to believe that our problem as a global Organization is that we have in many cases failed or refused to listen to views from the countries whose peoples\u2019 lives we want to improve.\nThe universal push to transform the world through the Sustainable Development Goals cannot be achieved without us listening to one another \u2014 whether we are large nations or small, whether we are rich countries or poor, developed nations or developing ones, like mine, South Sudan. What happens in one part of the world affects other parts of the world. Therefore, it is imperative that we work together to resolve critical issues that affect our planet, such as, inter alia, terrorism, conflicts, migration, climate change, nuclear proliferation, racism and food insecurity. These issues require collective and cooperative action if we are to make the world a better place for all of us. If we want to transform our world, then all of us must be made to feel that we all belong to it, as a matter of right and obligation, and we must work as true partners in its transformation. The attitudes of superiority and patronage, disguised as promoting democracy, human rights and freedom and justice, can easily lead to serious crises in the form of resistance from affected parties.\nWe in South Sudan believe in dialogue and respect for each other as we engage in resolving problems. And as the Security Council continues to strive to maintain world peace and order, as provided for in Articles 23 and 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, we in South Sudan want to be active participants in the achievement of these noble goals. We want peace in South Sudan and the world at large, not only for the present generation but also for future generations. Our actions as individual countries or as States Members of the United Nations should therefore be seen to promote peace, and not create more conflicts. In our recent history, our actions have created more suffering than it has solved problems. That should not be the case if we want to be true to the ideals and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter.\nI want to assure the Assembly that our Government has consented to Security Council resolution 2304 (2016). The resolution\u2019s implementation is being discussed by the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS), the South Sudanese Transitional Government of National Unity and other countries in the region. My Government\u2019s position is that we have to engage more with the United Nations on the details of the resolution\u2019s implementation in order to avoid derailing national healing and reconciliation. External intervention often negatively affects internal reconciliation. The tasks of the Regional Protection Force can be advanced through collaboration and cooperation with the Transitional Government.\nLast but not least, the Republic of South Sudan will cooperate with UNMISS, regional bodies, IGAD, the East African Community, the AU, the troika, the EU and all of our friends in our journey towards recovery from the tragedy that befell us. We promise to bring peace and justice and to rebuild strong and credible institutions in our country. It is our plan to move the country forward on its major development projects \u2014 roads and bridges, new cities, power grids, education and health \u2014 and in modernizing agriculture, so that we can feed our people. We are going to commit our endowed resources of oil, minerals, human capital and others to the development of the youngest nation in the world. We call upon our partners for support, cooperation, consultation and dialogue as we partner together in transforming our world through the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin my statement by congratulating the President and his country, the Republic of Fiji, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I am confident that his wisdom and competence will enable him to steer the work of the Assembly to a successful conclusion. I would also like to assure him that my delegation stands ready to cooperate with him in achieving our desired goals. Nor should I miss this opportunity to express our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of the Kingdom of Denmark, for his effectiveness in conducting the work of the Assembly at its seventieth session, which was key to ensuring that agreements were reached on several international issues.\nI would also like to put on record our appreciation for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s tireless efforts over the past 10 years to serve the shared interests of the international community and bring the work of the\nOrganization and its organs up to the expectations of Member States.\nSince its establishment in 1945, the United Nations has attained a position of esteem in international relations. In that regard, we would like to express our appreciation to the Organization\u2019s founding States, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, for their efforts to maintain international peace and security despite the challenges they continue to face. They have made the Organization a safe haven in which States can settle their disputes and differences by peaceful means, based on the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, which uphold the principles of mutual respect, good- neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and peaceful coexistence.\nWe would be remiss if we failed to point out that the world has seen many successes and positive developments, politically, socially, economically, scientifically and technically, which today have made us closer and more interdependent than ever before. However, we are still dealing with many challenges and tragedies that humankind can never forget, challenges that should motivate us all to work harder in support of international peace and security.\nWe in the Sultanate of Oman continue to believe that there is a solution for every problem as long as our interests converge, the necessary political will is there and we act in a concerted way. That is because by their nature people are inclined to love peace, understanding and peaceful coexistence, which serve the interests of all parties based on the golden rule that we should do unto others as we would do unto ourselves. My country is therefore among the States that have adopted a policy of dialogue, negotiation and conciliation in order to settle disputes by peaceful means, based on the provisions of Chapter VI of the Charter and on the standards and traditions of our human heritage. Thanks to the peaceful diplomatic approach of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman, we have succeeded in establishing friendly relations and cooperation with countries all over the world that we are keen to maintain and develop in every area for the interests and for the good of the Sultanate and other countries.\nWe should also take this opportunity to emphasize the centrality of the Palestinian question for stability in the Middle East. If we cannot reach a comprehensive and just solution to the issue, it is difficult to imagine the possibility of establishing normal relations between the States and peoples of the region in a way that can foster mutual trust and coexistence. Despite the efforts of the international community and the various initiatives to help the Palestinians and the Israelis to reach an agreement on a road map that would look after the interest of both parties, all efforts failed to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, we would like to renew our call to the international community to intensify efforts through a new perspective that would enable the concerned parties to reach a comprehensive and just settlement that would end the long conflict.\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to the United Nations and to the Special Envoys of the Secretary-General for their efforts to reach peaceful settlements to crises in a number of States in the Middle East, especially the Syrian Arab Republic, the Republic of Yemen and Libya. However, we should note that the situations in those States have suffered serious setbacks, which threaten international peace and security.\nWe believe in the importance of adhering to the principle of dialogue in order to resolve disputes by peaceful means. Since the onset of the crises in the three aforementioned States, the Sultanate of Oman has sought to reconcile points of view with the parties concerned and to encourage them to reject differences and resume negotiation. The Sultanate has hosted several meetings towards that end, in coordination with the United Nations. In that respect, we cannot fail to pay tribute to the laudable efforts of the State of Kuwait for hosting the Yemen peace negotiations. We laud, in particular, the efforts exerted by His Highness Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to bridge the gap in the views of Yemeni parties. The goal has been to achieve a win-win solution to the conflict through peaceful negotiations.\nIn closing, we must emphasize the need for the spirit of joint international action, which makes it incumbent upon all of us to rid ourselves of the negative aspects of the past and concentrate on the positive elements of the future. Our goal should be to develop relations, enhance cooperation, deepen interests between States and peoples, and settle differences through dialogue that is based on the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international legal principles. By doing so, the United Nations will remain the beacon of peace for all States.\n"

        "file_text": "A year ago, world leaders gave the green light to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The document is now our common guide for the next 15 years. In the history of the Organization, there have been similar grand initiatives. Unfortunately, some of them have remained confined to paper, such as the idea 40 years ago of establishing a new world economic order. I very much hope that a similar fate does not befall the current Agenda. Yet such fears do exist. The main problem is that the world lacks systemic stability, which means that there is no confidence in what will come tomorrow, and there is no confidence that the world is evolving in accordance with rational order and common sense. Wars, conflicts and increasing transnational challenges give rise to a feeling of chaos, a chaos that exists side by side with unprecedented interconnectedness and scientific and technological progress. In other words, we are living in conditions of contradictory realities.\nHow has chaos become a serious contender with positive a globalization progress? I think there are three answers to that question \u2014 political, economic and social. From a political point of view, problems have arisen because the so-called winners of the Cold War did not want to integrate the losers into their system. Furthermore, as was the case with the First World War, the victors tried to impose their will on the vanquished and to unilaterally carry out sweeping global changes that affected everyone, not just themselves. That attempt was unsuccessful. It could not have been otherwise. It is probably true that history does teach us something here. The consequences of that attempt were terrible \u2014 the destruction of States, festering conflicts, mega-terrorism, large movements of people in the form of migration. As a result, in terms of politics, the world is now in a period of transition. However, we do not know what we are moving towards.\nWe must also consider the economic factor. In that context, there has always been a conflict between the State and the market \u2014 at least since the time of the Industrial Revolution. Balanced and healthy competition is unquestionably useful for economic progress and reducing poverty and inequality. However, in recent decades the balance has been disturbed. The market has gained the upper hand and the State has been relegated to second place. That has happened because it was the objective pursued by so-called corporate capital, which has dominated life in leading developed countries. And what has that free market given us? The minority \u2014 the true advocate of corporate capital \u2014 has achieved even greater wealth. For everybody else corporate capital has meant nothing but suffering and problems.\nIt is also important that the market has seriously exacerbated the environmental challenges that the world faces. The market is not concerned with anything except profit. What does the market care about the environment?\nProblems of a social nature are probably not so obvious to the general public. At the same time, they are no less serious and no less dangerous than the challenges we face in the political and economic spheres. We are seeing growing social and cultural gaps in the world, and problems of identity loom large. As a result we are spending more and more time arguing about essentially spiritual matters. Without question, there are understandable reasons for the advent of a counterculture in various countries half a century ago. There is also an explanation for how that phenomenon has changed social relations in the West, particularly in the areas of morals, moral values and the family. However, there is something that makes no sense and that is why such changes should affect the rest of the world. Why should those who have accepted the changes impose them on others whose historical contexts were different and whose societies therefore had no reason to adopt similar changes?\nUnderstanding the reasons for the advent of an unstable world that is full of contradictions is certainly important. That is the first step towards action. Therefore, what do we have to do to change the negative global context? In political terms, we have to have a clear understanding of where we want to go from the current period of transition. What is the new world order that we are endeavouring to create? Of course, that is easier said than done. In that context, I cannot help but quote the outstanding thinker Immanuel Kant who said that\n\u201cbuilding a just and peaceful international system is the most difficult of all tasks and a perfect solution is impossible\u201d.\nWe all have ideas about how to change the world, but those ideas are different and we will all have to sacrifice something if we want to enact a change for the better. The result will reflect the lowest common denominator, but that is inevitable. I am not going to try to predict what the reality of this new world order will be in terms of its form and content. I would just like to focus attention on three principles that we think are essential to building that world order.\nFirst, the new system should be State-driven. States remain, as they have been, the main players in international life. Where States are non-existent or weak, anarchy, chaos and violence reign. Secondly, the new world order should be inclusive. That means that all States, without exception, should have a voice \u2014 a real voice, not just one for the sake of appearances. Thirdly, I am deeply convinced that the new system cannot be imposed; it needs to be cultivated. Only then would it be considered fair by both politicians and ordinary people.\nIn terms of the economy, we have been seeing positive trends, notably in connection with the re-establishment of a balance between the State and the market. The financial and economic crisis of the past decade demonstrated the failure of free-market ideas. As a result, around the world we have been seeing the re-establishment and strengthening of the State role in economic affairs. It is important for that trend to continue. Belarus has in the past consistently been committed to the idea of a strong State, especially in economic matters, and we plan to continue that policy in the future. It is the will of the Belarusian people, which was clearly expressed in June at the Belarusian People\u2019s Assembly.\nIn the context of economics, another important trend is towards regional integration. To some extent, regional blocs have begun to play an independent role \u2014 one which until recently had been the prerogative of States. Since that seems to be the trend, there is a pressing need to establish cooperation mechanisms for regional processes similar to those we have established for States. Belarus holds that theme very close to heart. Belarus, as an active participant in a number of regional integration processes, remains very committed thereto. We have a vested interest in strengthening those processes and are deeply convinced that cooperation with other regional initiatives will facilitate that task. Our approach could be summed up as \u201cintegrating integration\u201d. To assist in implementing that concept, we shall soon convene a conference on this issue in Minsk, with the support of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\nFinally, on the need for action in social and cultural areas, let us begin with a very simple fact. We are all different as a result of a host of different factors \u2014 geography, climate, wars, epidemics, religions and many others. Those factors have made us who we are. Tradition and culture cannot be changed. They have the power to unite. In a given territory they unite the people who died there, the people who are living there now and the people who have not yet been born. It is therefore obvious that imposing our preferences on each other is a mistaken and pointless endeavour.\nWhat we need in this situation is dialogue, both dialogue to understand one another and dialogue that is a goal in itself. Dialogue should be an ongoing process that helps to find common ground among the different social and cultural approaches and that yields a positive result.\nLet us consider the concept of the family as an example. We in Belarus are committed to the values of a traditional family, while in other countries there may be a recognition of a variety of types of family. We think that the individual is part of a family. Others, however, may assume that the family belongs to the individual. We do not need to demonstrate to each other the rightness of our particular approach. Instead, we should understand why we hold different positions. Can our different approaches lead to some kind of positive result? I think they can.\nThe Republic of Belarus sees an opportunity for addressing such approaches at the meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs scheduled for March 2017, at which a draft resolution will be proposed on the role of the family in preventing illicit drug trafficking. We all have an interest in an effective fight against that challenge. We need to think together about how the family may be able to help in that area, despite the fact that we may understand the concept of family differently.\nIf Member States really want to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, they need to restore world stability and overcome the growing chaos. I am convinced that this is possible, and that the United Nations, with its wealth of expertise, has the potential to help States in that endeavour. In any case, it is important that the United Nations work on practical implementation of the Agenda rather than immerse itself in the usual optimization, synchronization and report-writing. It is important to recognize that the Secretariat has not always worked in harmony with Member States. We hope that situation will change for the better under the new Head of our Organization.\nThe new Agenda for the United Nations, like the current global context, poses significant challenges for us. Looking at the prospects for their implementation, I call on everyone to be guided by the words of the second Secretary-General, Mr. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who said,\n\u201cNever measure the height of a mountain until you have reached the top. Then you will see how low it was.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly at its seventy-first session holds special significance for Samoa and the Pacific region. At the helm of the General Assembly for the first time ever is a Pacific Islander and diplomat from Fiji, His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson. The Pacific is often considered a region of peace and tranquillity, but such credit belies the diverse and enormous challenges that we face daily, as a group and as island States. The focus of your presidency, Sir, on the collective implementation of all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is therefore a timely and fitting catalyst to help transform our region\u2019s numerous challenges into real and lasting opportunities. Samoa congratulates you on your election as President of the General Assembly and lends its full support to the agenda that will guide our work during your tenure.\nThis general debate is the Secretary-General\u2019s final one before he steps down after a decade of service to the cause of humankind. From Samoa\u2019s perspective, Mr. Ban Ki-moon has been, and continues to be, a true champion of and persistent advocate for issues that are of immense significance to small island developing States (SIDS). His passionate leadership on climate change \u2014 the undisputed priority concern of every Pacific island country and territory \u2014 has endeared him to the Pacific region. Equally memorable is the rare distinction he holds as the only Secretary-General in the 71-year history of the United Nations who has ever visited the Pacific region twice during his term of office. That is no mean feat, given the constraints of isolation and travel.\nIn September 2011, the Secretary-General attended the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders summit in New Zealand, visiting Solomon Islands and Kiribati along the way. There he witnessed at first hand both the scars and excessive damage to the physical landscape and coastlines caused by climate change, on the one hand, and, on the other, the resilience and sheer determination of Pacific peoples on the front lines of climate change to ensure the survival of some of the islands and their continued existence as sovereign nations.\nLater, in 2014, Samoa\u2019s isolation and lack of political clout in the global arena were bridged when Mr. Ban Ki-moon, together with the entire Chief Executive Board, visited to attend the United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States hosted by Samoa on behalf of the Pacific region. On his arrival Mr. Ban was welcomed as \u201cHis Excellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations\u201d. A few days later on his departure, he was fondly bid farewell as \u201cAfioga Tupua Ban Ki-moon\u201d, after he was conferred the princely title of Tupua. Such events are now a memorable part of our history. The close rapport between the Secretary- General and our region was further evidenced this morning when Pacific leaders met with him as part of our yearly meetings in New York \u2014 a much-anticipated event, which has become an annual feature of our September calendar.\nI would like to add that as this chapter in the Secretary-General\u2019s and Samoan chief\u2019s life of service to multilateralism draws to a close, we thank him for his principled leadership and robust advocacy with regard to issues that affect and have an impact on our islands and peoples personally and directly. We wish him well in his future calling and trust that his successor will embrace and continue his legacy, especially in the context of climate change and the much anticipated Paris Agreement, which is about to enter into force. Should he find that prospects are hard to come by, he should remember that he has the Tupua dominion in Samoa.\nLast year, we agreed on a number of global agendas, outcomes and agreements. They represent our hopes for solutions to address the issues before our Assembly, ranging from sustainable development to climate change, from disaster-risk resilience to development financing and from humanitarian challenges to peace and security. Collectively, they represent the totality of our needs and priorities, including the means to achieve them. Every issue is important and all are interconnected. None should be considered to be subordinate to any another, to be marginalized, abandoned or sidelined. They deserve to be implemented through an all-inclusive approach to ensure that they will be addressed and treated equally. Only then can one say with some level of comfort that, in the implementation of our new sustainable agenda, no one will be left behind.\nThat is the backdrop and the reality against which the world is anxiously awaiting the selection of Mr. Ban Ki-moon\u2019s successor in the task of steering the United Nations during the critical implementation phase of our inspirational goals. It is a mammoth task, but not an impossible one.\nAs the search for a new Secretary-General is gaining momentum, an appointment appears imminent. Yet in this all-important process, Samoa, like others, is largely a bystander and an observer \u2014 not by choice, but by design. Like the majority of Member States, Samoa hopes that the current selection practice will be reformed soon to give the wider membership a more active role in selecting who the head of their Organization should be. We can only hope for the institutionalization of best practices.\nSamoa expects the new Secretary-General to be independent and not beholden to the priorities and influences of those who will sanction the appointment. The Secretary-General should treat each and every Member State equally and accord the same level of attention and priority to their issues and concerns, regardless of their size, political influence or economic might. We look forward to welcoming and working closely with the new appointee. We are confident that new leadership will usher in a spring of hope that will provide a tailored and fit-for-purpose Secretariat for the challenging task at hand. Only in true partnership can Member States and the Secretariat work in concert to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the demonstrable commitment and political will to transform the Paris Agreement on Climate Change into reality and that it is poised to enter into force sometime soon. That is a welcome and positive development, especially from the perspective of all island nations, given the extent to which impacts of climate change are already being felt. When cyclones and natural disasters are happening more frequently and with greater intensity in our part of the world, as witnessed recently in Vanuatu and Fiji, the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement is everyone\u2019s top priority. As vulnerable small island developing States, we cannot afford to lose the hard- earned gains of many years. We applaud the leadership shown by Member States that have ratified the Paris Agreement or pledged to do so soon so that it can enter into force in record time.\nThe science of climate change is quite clear and unequivocal. The political will to accelerate the early operationalization of the Paris Agreement is now evident. But signing and ratifying the climate agreement are the easy and early achievables. Delivering on promises and making good on commitments and undertakings pledged are the seal of true leadership. We need to match the political will with the provision of adequate resources that are easily accessible so that the climate pledges already submitted to the United Nations can be used to facilitate early implementation of all efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions without delay.\nThe coordinated management and utilization of the Global Environment Facility, the Adaptation Fund and the newly established Green Climate Fund, as well as the complementarity offered by other funding sources, both private and public, will become all the more critical in the implementation phase. The challenge has been raised for the Green Climate Fund and other funding institutions to assist small island developing States in accessing resources through a streamlined and simplified project cycle and approval process.\nAddressing climate change is everyone\u2019s responsibility, not a monopoly reserved solely for Governments. In 2015, we boldly declared a shared commitment to stronger global efforts to ensure that all people have a right to live in dignity, free from want and fear. The Sustainable Development Goals were not just visionary goals or mere aspirations; they are designed to provide for basic human needs of all people in an achievable manner within our lifetime. Our optimism was rooted in a culture of shared responsibility and a belief in humankind. Achieving the SDGs will not be easy without the support of our development partners. Sustainable development requires sustained efforts and commitment. Partnerships with the donor community require mutual trust and understanding.\nThe 2030 Agenda integrating the three pillars of sustainable development is not just a preferable option: it is the only option. Samoa volunteered to report on its implementation of the new global agenda during this year\u2019s high-level political forum on sustainable development, less than a year after the Agenda was adopted. In addition to offering to share its experience with the wider United Nations membership, Samoa was also eager to benefit and learn from the experiences of the other 21 States that were reviewed.\nThe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway is an integral part of our wider 2030 Agenda. It represents a dedicated road map for SIDS to make\nthe transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the SDGs and for the eventual achievement of the 17 new Goals. Our new Agenda highlights partnerships as an important part of Sustainable Development Goal 17; indeed, partnerships are the very means of implementation. With the SIDS Partnership Framework already launched, it is important that all SIDS development partners and United Nations agencies are actively and constructively engaged and that the platform continues to be supported, monitored and reported on regularly.\nDifferent partnership modalities will be forged from time to time, depending on SIDS priorities. There can be the traditional North-South cooperation, the emerging South-South cooperation, the well-tested triangular cooperation or even the novel SIDS-SIDS partnerships. Importantly, every partnership matters. When one belongs to the United Nations group with special challenges and vulnerabilities in the context of sustainable development, all options should be open for consideration. The SIDS Partnership Framework and the Steering Committee provide the platform from which new partnerships will emerge through outreach initiatives and coordination to ensure that all partners involved work together cooperatively and in a cohesive manner to meet SIDS development needs.\nOceans and seas have a fundamental role to play in contributing to global prosperity, from regulating climate to providing food security for billions of people. They are an important source of employment and income for many communities around the world. The sustainable management of oceans and seas is therefore critical for economic and social development and poverty eradication and for raising living standards worldwide.\nYet the health of the oceans is increasingly compromised by the pressures of overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, habitat loss and pollution. As the health of the marine ecosystems declines, so too does their capacity to provide food, livelihoods and incomes. These impacts disproportionately affect our island countries, which are the most vulnerable and least able to adapt. And if the trends continue, critical thresholds may soon be reached, with potentially dire consequences for our islands\u2019 food security, incomes and livelihoods.\nIt was against the backdrop of mounting challenges and a sense of pessimism in the light of the fragmentation of United Nations discussions on ocean issues that the Pacific small island developing States championed the push for oceans to be a stand-alone goal in the new set of Sustainable Development Goals. SDG 14 is now the dedicated Goal on oceans. Last week\u2019s third Our Ocean conference, hosted by the United States Government and under the leadership of Secretary of State John Kerry, and the high-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, to be held in June 2017, are welcome efforts at the global level to address some of our emerging concerns. The start of the preparatory process to develop an international, legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction is a positive development \u2014 a step in the right direction \u2014 in which the Pacific islands are participating very actively.\nThe world is a powerless witness to the tragedy of people fleeing from their countries to avoid being mired in the destruction of war and terrorism. Obviously, a credible and long-term response is needed to address this grave crisis that has cost so many innocent lives and affected so many people. Individual actions by States cannot in themselves lead to a solution. We must all shoulder the responsibility of collectively meeting the threat through concerted multilateral action, consistent with the spirit that underlies the Organization. Ideally, this effort must start in the Security Council, which is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining world peace.\nIt is in that conviction that Samoa calls on the Security Council to address the threat posed by the recent actions of North Korea to the peace and stability of the Asia and Pacific region, if not the whole world. Imagine how easily achievable some if not all of the 17 SDGs would be if all the resources spent on futile wars were instead diverted for the much-needed economic and social activities that are so necessary for the creation of a peaceful society.\nOur world has enjoyed peace and security for 70 years by faithfully observing and following the Charter of our Organization. World leaders with the power and authority to end wars have the moral duty and responsibility to ensure that our people continue to live in peace and harmony for many more years to come. In their reflective wisdom, our leaders have reaffirmed their faith in a strengthened and reformed United Nations as a vital multilateral institution that can respond effectively and ably to the challenges of the twenty-first century and deliver on the Millennium Declaration.\nSamoa supports an enlarged Security Council in both membership categories to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. The case for democratic practices and transparency in the Security Council\u2019s procedures and working methods in order to facilitate a more engaged and effective relationship with the General Assembly remains a compelling one. On the other hand, the Assembly must work hard to regain the confidence of the world in its status as the highest representative decision-making body of the Organization.\nLet me now pay homage to the selfless work performed by the men and women in the Blue Helmets serving in various peacekeeping operations, some of whom have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Samoa will continue to provide civilian policemen and policewomen as its tangible contribution to such a noble cause.\nLet us remember that the strength of our Organization lies in our numbers and our diverse membership. We must rise above the confines of national interests and work to benefit from the diverse richness of our membership. Let us capitalize on our unity in diversity and set aside our differences so that, as nations united, we can be the vanguard for the good of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to first congratulate you, Ambassador Peter Thompson, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to assure you of Ghana\u2019s support and cooperation during this session and throughout your tenure. I congratulate also Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his selfless and dedicated service to our Organization over the past ten years and on his achievements during his tenure of office. His time as Secretary-General has witnessed some key defining moments for the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security, development and human rights, and I commend him for his leadership.\nI am President of the Republic of Ghana. I was born one year after my country gained independence from colonial domination in 1957. I was born in the same year as Michael Jackson, whose untimely tragic death shocked the whole world. Michael was also known as the king of pop and was one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived. The words of his 1991 hit song \u201cHeal the World\u201d continue to echo to us from his grave. Michael Jackson sang, \u201cHeal the world. Make the world a better place for you and for me, and the entire human race\u201d.\nHis song was released in 1991, at a time of excitement for the world. In the 58 years of my life, I have seen the world change more rapidly than in the millions of years of its existence. My life has spanned the excitement of the post-war era, the heady days of our liberation from colonial rule in Africa, the Apollo moon landing, the Cold War, the excitement at the fall of the Berlin wall, the era of globalization, the end of apartheid, the global progress of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Arab Spring, Brexit, China\u2019s slowdown, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, cyberattacks \u2014 and the list goes on and on.\nOur world today is more complicated than it has ever been. The question I ask is: what happened to the ideals that gave birth to the United Nations? What happened to the enthusiasm that captured the spirit of the post-war world, which envisioned peace, safety and security for all humankind? What happened to our excitement at the thawing of the Cold War; to our joy at the collapse of apartheid?\nThe era of the Cold War created a paradoxical safety and security. The bipolar world and the arms race assured mutual destruction from any nuclear war, and therefore the world was a more predictable place. Those of us in developing countries hid behind our shield of the Non-Aligned Movement. We marched against nuclear armaments and envisioned the day that the nuclear arms race would end, so that the trillions of dollars that were being spent by the super-Powers on nuclear weapons would yield a dividend that would create a life of prosperity for all people on Earth.\nPresident Reagan stood before the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in 1987 and said \u201cMr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d In President Reagan\u2019s words, walls cannot withstand faith, walls cannot withstand truth, and walls cannot withstand freedom. The fall of the Berlin Wall opened a vision of a new world \u2014 the era of globalization; an age where trade and interaction among people of the world would spread prosperity across the globe. It did, to some extent. The rise of the Asian tigers; the emerging world of China, Brazil, South Africa and India; the turn of the millennium and the Millennium Development Goals raised millions of people out of poverty.\nA young man in West Africa drops out of school and takes to selling petty items along the streets of the city. In agreement with four of his friends, they decide to raise money and try to make it to the greener pastures of Europe. They pay their way through the Niger and arrive at Agadez, whence they brave the trek of death. This is a dangerous hike across the harshest desert on Earth \u2014 the Sahara. They are attacked by bandits along the way and robbed of all their money and provisions. They are rescued by some Good Samaritans.\nTwo members of their group do not make it through the desert crossing. After months of living under the threat of death from many armed groups, including the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham in Libya, they finally board an overloaded dinghy bound for Italy. Rescued from the sea after their dinghy capsizes, only one of them remains, held in a refugee detention centre in Italy. He is the lucky one \u2014 the only one of five friends to survive the perilous journey. How long he will remain in the detention centre, he does not know.\nThis could be the story of any young African seeking a better life in Europe. All over the world, there are new walls being built \u2014 walls that imprison us and block us from the rest of the world. The young African refugee in an Italian detention centre is facing one new such wall. In many parts of the world, extremist forces have hijacked the dialogue, and among the millennial generation all available cutting-edge technology is used to spread anxieties that evoke fear and arouse our basest emotions.\nHate speech is becoming common. People complain of being tired of being politically correct. In many places, xenophobia has taken over rational thinking. In the vote on Brexit, the spectre of a flood of Syrian refugees was used as the instrument for propelling the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union. It is a paradox of our world that nearly 30 years after President Reagan called for the Berlin Wall to be torn down, new walls are springing up everywhere.\nYet we have the resources in this world to guarantee each person a decent life. In the implementation of the MDGs, despite the minimal resources that were injected by the wealthy nations, we managed by prioritizing our spending to put more children in school than ever before in history. We managed to pull more than 40 per cent of the world\u2019s people out of extreme poverty. In Valletta, the European Union put \u20ac1.8 billion into an emergency fund to cooperate with Africa in the curbing of unregulated migration, and yet with Africa\u2019s significant share of the world\u2019s arable lands, a youthful labour force and a significant share of the world\u2019s natural resources, a reordering of economic relations could create boundless opportunities that would keep young Africans at home, not risking their lives on these perilous journeys. Removing subsidies for farmers of the advanced world would create an even playing field for African farmers to compete. Removing revenue and non-revenue barriers to African produce would give African agriculture a fighting chance.\nSome of the young Africans who hazard the desert and the Mediterranean Sea to cross to Europe from my country are young poultry farmers or other entrepreneurs who sell their shops and undertake the journey because they can no longer compete with the tons of frozen chicken dumped on African markets annually, or with the adverse business environment they have to face. Africa does not need sympathy or overseas development assistance. Africans need a fair chance to trade with the rest of the world and among ourselves.\nThe progress towards the creation of a continental free-trade area is commendable and must be fast- tracked. Raising intra-African trade alone from the paltry average of 15 per cent would create better opportunities for Africa\u2019s youth. We can achieve a lot in collaboration with the rest of the world, and yet we must realize that a lot also rests within our own capacity to achieve as Africans. Recently, I took the decision as President of Ghana to allow citizens of other African countries travelling to Ghana to obtain visas on arrival. This would stimulate trade and investment if it were replicated across the entire continent.\nStructural reforms are required in many areas. Governance is also a critical area that requires reform in Africa. Democracy unleashes the creative juices of our citizens. Africa has made remarkable progress. Elections are held regularly, civil society groups and think tanks have become more vocal, and the media is increasingly free. Yet there is a lot more that we can do to allow Africans the space to express themselves. Democracy is not a one-size-fits-all system; different countries are at different stages of the democratic journey. Democracy evolves and cannot be forced on the people. It does not help for bigger Powers to proselytize democracy across the continent. It can have negative consequences, as we are experiencing in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. But still, a properly functioning peer system can avoid some of the meltdowns we are experiencing in some African countries due to a desire to remain in office interminably.\nThe mistake with Africa is that we are seen as a homogenous unit and treated as such. It is not acknowledged that we are a whole continent with different aspirations, cultures, democracies and economic developments. Human progress is not a seamless movement forward. It encompasses periods of reversal, mistakes, fumbling and even falling. All parts of the world have been through this and learned from their mistakes. They have picked themselves up after a fall and continued moving. Africa must be allowed the same latitude.\nA few years ago the term \u201cAfrica Rising\u201d painted a picture of a continent on the move. Recent headwinds experienced due to the China slowdown and the collapse of commodity prices have caused some sceptics of Africa to once again gloat about the notion that nothing good can come out of the continent. Africa is a continent of 54 countries at different stages of progress and development. There must be room for us to make our mistakes and learn from them. Africa has the potential to be the next continent on the rise. It has a lot going for it. The continent has many success stories. Africa has the fastest growing population, and thus a very youthful labour force; the fastest growing middle class, with increasing disposable incomes; and the fastest growing information and communication technology networks in the world.\n16/48 16-29421 Africa needs strengthened institutions and we are working to build them. We must engrain transparency and integrity more and more into our governance systems. President Obama said on his historic visit to Ghana that what Africa needs is strong institutions. We must strengthen our institutions of governance to eliminate the incidence of corruption that impoverishes our people.\nMy country, Ghana, is a part of Africa\u2019s success story. I am proud of my country. We are variously called the \u201cmodel of democracy\u201d in Africa or the \u201cbeacon of democracy\u201d. We have not looked back since the adoption of our 1992 Constitution. Successive elections, with power occasionally swinging between opposing political parties, have established Ghana\u2019s democratic credentials in the world. A strict two-term limit for the President guarantees that every eight years a new person will be in charge.\nGhana has a fiercely independent media, with hundreds of newspapers and radio stations. I always say jokingly to my colleagues that in Ghana I have 27 million Presidents, all of whom know my job better than I do. Every morning on the political talk shows across the country, my fellow citizens can be heard coaching me on how to do my job and what my responsibilities are as President.\nBold measures in effecting structural reforms have yielded a more stable and resilient economy, with a deficit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) target of 4.9 per cent this year, among other favourable targets. With a stable currency, business confidence is rising and foreign direct investment remains very strong. Ghana has been chugging along at a respectable average of about 6 per cent GDP growth rate over the past decade. With the structural reforms we have undertaken, in collaboration with our development partners, and new developments in our offshore oil and gas prospects, Ghana is predicted to clip along from next year at a respectable 8 per cent growth per annum.\nOver the past decade, we have invested heavily in expanding our socioeconomic infrastructure. Investments in health care, education, power, water, roads and ports are yielding significant dividends for us and creating more employment opportunities for our young people. These investments are yielding dividends in improved health care, increased enrolment at all levels of the educational ladder, improved transportation systems and the growth of the small and medium enterprises.\nWith the modest progress we are making, we are able to recapture the vision of the founder of our nation. It is a happy coincidence that on his birth anniversary today, I have the opportunity to address the world from the prestigious rostrum of the General Assembly. Today, 21 September, marks the birthday of Kwame Nkrumah. Many African leaders of our current generation draw inspiration from him. President Kwame Nkrumah was a champion of African liberation and a staunch Pan- Africanist. I wish all my country men and women a happy Founder\u2019s Day.\nTwo years ago, I stood on this stage (see A/69/PV.9) and in my capacity as Chair of the Economic Community of West African States called for urgent action to halt the spread of the Ebola virus disease, which was ravaging three of our West African neighbours and threatening to spread across the whole subregion. Today, I stand here to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations for their prompt response in setting up the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), which was based in Ghana. UNMEER will probably go down in the history of the United Nations as one of the most successful and effective missions ever deployed by the Organization. I also salute the international community for its effective response in the form of logistics, personnel, medication and other material that helped to snuff out the disease in a relatively short time.\nMy particular commendation goes to the brave volunteers, including 41 of my own countrymen, who risked their lives by going into the infection zone to assist in the fight against the disease. Ghana remains proud of its contribution towards ending that crisis and of its support to the United Nations system and the international community when we made our country the staging post for the international response and the United Nations Mission on the Ebola Emergency Response, despite the threats.\nFollowing the Ebola response, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and I wrote to the Secretary-General calling for the establishment of a high-level panel to prepare a report that would allow the world to respond better in times of such global health crises. We are faced with such a situation already in respect of the exponential spread of the Zika virus. We must use the lessons learned from the Ebola crisis to confront that new threat.\nAnother threat we must confront together as a united world is the threat of terrorism. No part of the world is safe. In our subregion, the activities of Boko Haram in north-eastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin have displaced millions of people and claimed thousands of casualties. Attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire show that all our countries are at risk. Terrorism is one of the gravest threats to world peace and security today.\nWe cannot be under any illusion about the imminent threat to all of us even as we go about our daily activities. But the solution is not to shut our doors to foreigners who may have genuine cause for visiting, including tourism, business or sanctuary as refugees. That is what the terrorists want to us to do; they seek to instil fear and panic in us in order that we shut our doors on the rest of the world. Ghana stands in solidarity with all countries that have experienced terrorism recently: Bangladesh, Belgium, France, Germany, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United States of America. No, we must not give in to them. The terrorists must not win, they cannot win and they will not win.\nI wish to commend the United States and Cuba for the progress made in thawing the relations between the two neighbours. We have all been watching with excitement the removal of some of the last vestiges of the Cold War with the reopening of embassies in the two capitals, President Obama\u2019s historic visit and the resumption of flights between the two countries. The time has come to take the remaining steps to completely lift the blockade on Cuba. I hope that this can be achieved before President Obama\u2019s Administration leaves office.\nGhana once again wishes to reiterate its support for a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There is no military solution to this conflict. Israel\u2019s security can be guaranteed only by a peaceful and stable Palestinian State coexisting side by side with Israel. Unfortunately, the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands continues to make such a solution more and more difficult to attain.\nLast September, we convened in this very Hall and made a commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is an ambitious yet achievable Agenda whose Goals and Targets go far beyond the imperatives of economic growth by tackling the root causes of poverty and deprivation and delivering on the social and environmental dimensions of development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development not only marks the beginning of a new and even more promising phase in our trajectory as a global body, but also challenges us to develop new and innovative partnerships that I believe will guarantee progress evenly across regions and for all people. The 17 Goals and 169 Targets underscore the underlying values of the United Nations, as enshrined in its Charter, and provide renewed impetus to its activities in sustaining peace, preserving our planet, ensuring socioeconomic justice and safeguarding the dignity of mankind.\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015- 2030, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development and the Sustainable Development Goals represent four important, mutually reinforcing landmark agreements that open a new chapter in global development towards ensuring prosperity for our people and preserving our planet.\nI am impressed by the level of commitment that the United States and China, two of the major emitters of greenhouse gases, have shown by agreeing to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I hope that this will be the catalyst that brings the Agreement into force, and state that we, as a generation, are unequivocally committed to bequeathing a better world to future generations. We must not fail to do this. As leaders, we are also responsible for moving beyond setting norms to delivering on our commitments at the national, regional and global levels. If we do not achieve them all simultaneously, it must not be for want of effort.\nI am particularly honoured to co-chair the Secretary- General\u2019s advocacy group in support of the SDGs. While we acknowledge that national leadership and ownership are critical, global partnerships are needed for financial resources, policy advice and technical assistance. I am happy to inform you, Mr. President, that Ghana has begun work in earnest to implement the SDGs. We will establish the necessary national structures to ensure that the policies and measures taken in that regard fall in line with our 40-year development plan, currently being formulated. I have also signed the ratification instrument of the Paris Agreement and will take part in the event today depositing Ghana\u2019s instrument with the United Nations.\nThe Security Council remains an important source of legitimacy for international action on peace and security. While Africa accounts for close to one third of the membership of the United Nations and nearly two thirds of the work of the Council, it remains woefully underrepresented in the permanent and non-permanent category. Eleven long years after the African Union adopted the Ezulwini Consensus, we are nowhere near achieving a more equitable reform of the Security Council. That will continue to remain a scar on the conscience of this world body if not remedied as quickly as possible.\nGhana is a leading democracy in Africa. I stand before the world today to declare that, just as we have done in the past, my country will go to the polls this December, and the processes before, during and after will mark a further consolidation of Ghana\u2019s credentials as a leading world democracy.\nIn conclusion, let me once again express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his extraordinary leadership during his tenure as Secretary-General. The people of Ghana, my wife and I wish the Secretary- General and Mrs. Ban Soon-taek well in their future endeavours. It is my wish that history record our time here in this Hall as one that gave reality to Michael Jackson\u2019s song: \u201cheal the world/make the world a better place for you and for me/and for the entire human race.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General Assembly at this session, and to wish him complete success. I thank his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, and take this opportunity to express our high appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his able leadership.\nTwo days ago, Armenia celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence. During that short period of time, much has been done to strengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law and good governance, to protect human rights and to advance economic reforms. We have been able to achieve significant progress also with regard to the socioeconomic development agenda.\nHowever, challenges still remain. The needs of the socially most vulnerable groups have been placed at the centre of Armenia\u2019s forward-looking development strategy for 2014-2025. Likewise, our Government has launched a national plan of action on the protection of human rights. In that respect, Armenia continues to work actively with all United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the special procedures and the treaty bodies.\nOur new constitutional reform followed an inclusive process of broad public discussions aimed at implementing a new and improved governance system with increased transparency and accountability. It was approved in a nationwide referendum last December and welcomed by relevant international bodies.\nThe United Nations has a considerable role to play in changing the environment, which has been conducive to intolerance, racial discrimination, xenophobia, violent extremism and terrorism. On numerous occasions Armenia has condemned the crimes committed by Da\u2019esh and other terrorist groups that threaten the peoples of the region and beyond. The war in Syria has had a devastating impact on its civilian population, including national and religious minorities who face existential threats in the form of identity-based crimes. The violence has not bypassed Syrian-Armenians, many of whom have lost their lives. Armenian settlements, churches, schools and cultural institutions have been destroyed.\nOne hundred years ago, Armenian refugees found shelter in many Arab countries after the Armenian genocide. Today, thousands of Armenians, together with other peoples of the Middle East, have again been forced to flee their homes. From Syria, more than 20,000 have found refuge in Armenia. We know, therefore, what it means to be a refugee and to host refugees. The Government of Armenia has undertaken considerable efforts to assist the refugees and facilitate their integration.\nWe believe that wider international cooperation is needed to adequately address the challenges posed by the massive displacements. The full implementation of the commitments made in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), adopted a few days ago by the Assembly, stands as an important milestone in that regard.\nWe would like to stress the significance of addressing the root causes of large movements of people by working for the prevention of crimes against humanity and for the peaceful settlement of disputes and lasting political solutions. Armenia has been continuously supporting and contributing to the elaboration of prevention mechanisms, in particular by regularly initiating resolutions on the prevention of genocide in the Human Rights Council.\nAs a nation that experienced the first genocide of the twentieth century and continues to face the denial of that horror, Armenia reaffirms its strong support for the fight against impunity for genocide. The year 2016 marks the first anniversary of resolution 69/323, initiated by Armenia, proclaiming 9 December as the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime.\nAs the threat of violence continues to spread in various parts of the world, it is crucial to make our joint efforts to achieve peace and security more effective.\nBased on that understanding, Armenia has participated in a number of United Nations actions and United Nations-mandated peace operations, thus actively contributing in the most direct way to the building of international peace and security. As the Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations noted recently, \u201cArmenia\u2019s support is important not only for its contribution but also for Armenian history and the challenges overcome during it\u201d. Indeed, history teaches us that the security of one is closely connected to that of others.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the International Covenants on Human Rights, as well as the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development. The latter affirms\n\u201cthe right of peoples to self-determination, by virtue of which they have the right freely to determine their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development\u201d (resolution 41/128, annex, sixth preambular paragraph).\nIt is well known that the Charter of the United Nations underlines respect for the principles of the equal rights and the self-determination of peoples as a purpose of the Organization.\nAggressive military responses on the part of States to the peaceful aspirations of people to exercise their right to self-determination only legitimize such aspirations and deprives the aggressor of any claim to authority over the people. The Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order rightly pointed out that self-determination should not be viewed as a source of conflict, but rather that conflict is a consequence of the violation of the right to self-determination.\nAzerbaijan stubbornly refuses to recognize the right of the people of Nagorno Karabakh to self- determination. As part of Azerbaijan\u2019s policy of ethnic cleansing and aggression, starting in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, Armenians have been massacred and expelled from their homes. Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov called those actions a threat of a new genocide against the Armenian people.\nThis year again, in early April, in blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, Azerbaijan unleashed another large-scale aggression against Nagorno Karabakh, indiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure and the population. Among the victims were a 12-year-old boy and 92-year-old woman. Three captured soldiers of the Nagorno Karabakh armed forces were beheaded in Da\u2019esh style, which was subsequently shown in towns and villages and publicized through the social media. Furthermore, the leader of Azerbaijan publicly decorated the perpetrators of that crime. During the exchange of the bodies of the deceased between Nagorno Karabakh and Azerbaijan, which was mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, it was registered that the corpses transferred from the Azerbaijani side bore undeniable signs of torture and were mutilated. Such despicable atrocities go beyond the basic norms of the civilized world and constitute gross violations of international humanitarian law.\nThe aggression in April severely undermined the peace process. To restore trust and work for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, measures should be taken to prevent the use of force and to create conditions conducive to the advancement of the peace process. That was the main aim of two summit meetings on Nagorno Karabakh, held in Vienna in May and St. Petersburg in June. It is imperative to implement what was particularly emphasized and agreed upon at those meetings: first, the full adherence to the 1994 and 1995 trilateral ceasefire agreements, which do not have time limitations; secondly, the creation of a mechanism to investigate ceasefire violations; thirdly, the expansion of the capacity of the Personal Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairperson-in-Office. Against all odds the people of Nagorno Karabakh have been able to defend themselves and create a free and democratic society.\nArmenia, together with the mediator countries \u2014 Russia, the United States and France, which are the co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group \u2014 will continue its efforts towards an exclusively peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The co-Chairs have proposed a rather civilized formula for the settlement \u2014 ballots instead of bullets. The proposal outlined by the Presidents of the co-Chair countries stipulates the future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno Karabakh through a legally binding expression of the will of its population. The mentality that supports medieval barbarism, as witnessed in April, has difficulty accepting the civilized approaches of the modern world.\nArmenia welcomes the integration of the Vienna Programme of Action for the Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024 into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an important step to promote sustainable and inclusive development. The Government of Armenia has adopted a national strategy to ensure the effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action and make it a mainstream part of our policies.\nWe deplore policies that stipulate unilateral economic measures as an instrument of political pressure. Agenda 2030 reconfirms, once again, that such measures are detrimental to sustainable development. The unilateral land blockade of Armenia by Turkey is a gross violation of international law. It continues to severely hamper regional transit communication routes, economic cooperation and integration.\nArmenia welcomes the central role of the United Nations in the implementation of the comprehensive new 2030 Agenda. We do not underestimate the challenges facing all of us, and similarly, we should not downplay the opportunities. With the more than seven decades of the United Nations existence, we must show the same insight and vision to safeguard the future of the Organization and ensure the best possible future for the peoples of the United Nations. Armenia is fully committed to those goals.\n"

        "file_text": "\u201cNone of us acting alone can achieve success.\u201d These are the words of Nelson Mandela. We must decide and act together because only together can we come up with right responses to the many challenges that we face. Our responsibility is to offer every child \u2014 boy or girl \u2014 the keys to his or her own emancipation. Every man, every woman, wherever they are born, bears universal rights. They must be able to learn, to work, to care for themselves and to raise their children in peace and security. Technological, medical and social progress must be shared. It must not belong to a privileged few. That must be our commitment and our common goal.\nWe know the path by which we can reach such a goal. It has been embodied since 1948 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The universal values are a beacon that must shed an immutable light on the path of humankind. There should be no exception, no compromise and no renouncement of the respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy.\nAnd yet, let us look at the truth. Equality between women and man is not always a fact of life. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press are too often flouted. Homophobia, in some countries, has even been legalized, sometimes even through recent laws. In addition, too often, the rule of law is a smokescreen and justice is not a remedy but a threat to citizens and businesses.\nThe African continent overflows with strengths and talents. Its potential is immense. The histories of Europe and Africa are intrinsically linked and, of course, we share a future. It is vital that we all mobilize to encourage and support Africa\u2019s development, first of all, through more fairly apportioned economic growth and the emergence of a middle class. I support the creation of a genuinely equal, win-win partnership with Africa, based neither on nostalgia or guilt.\nI firmly believe, as history has always shown, that strengthened democratic rights and personal freedoms always go hand in hand with development and the improvement of people\u2019s living conditions. In the past few years, Africa has seen several successful democratic transitions, due above all to those citizens who have participated in their political and electoral processes and thereby solidified their democratic institutions and sovereignty.\nUnfortunately, some citizens are still too often deprived of the fundamental right to elect those who are supposed to represent them. In the words of John F. Kennedy, \u201cThose who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\u201d An honest election is a peaceful revolution, because the only legitimate Government is an elected one. Respect for the requirements of the rule of law, and therefore of a country\u2019s constitution, is the only possible way to ensure stability and democratic harmony. The people of Burundi have been denied that right, resulting in discord, division and even oppression. The only solution to that crisis is a genuinely inclusive inter-Burundian dialogue conducted under international mediation and in accordance with the Arusha Peace Agreement.\nIt is crucial that elections be held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and all doubts surrounding them removed. I firmly condemn all the violence that we have witnessed there, including in the past few days in Kinshasa. Those who exercise authority must assume their full and individual share of responsibility. I want to be very clear here. We respect the principles of sovereignty and independence, but on the condition that sovereignty does not become a smokescreen for abusing the rule of law and violating fundamental freedoms. I appeal to the country\u2019s political leaders both in the majority and the opposition to avoid an escalation. There should be a broad, inclusive dialogue. They should be equal to their country and people. They should not hide their faces. The only path to stability is by establishing, as soon as possible, a definite date for holding honest, credible elections.\nAt this point, we must admit that the situation in Syria constitutes a continuing failure for the international community. It is a country torn apart by unspeakable suffering, where massive numbers of refugees have been uprooted from their homes. We cannot accept the notion that the chaos in Syria serves the long-term geostrategic interests of Syrians, or their future. We cannot accept that one man\u2019s bloody obduracy stands in the way of a political solution and peace. We support Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura and urge all the permanent members of the Security Council to show that they have a sense of responsibility. We would also like to remind them that there can be no impunity for violations of international humanitarian law.\nWith Da\u2019esh, as with Al-Qaida, Boko Haram and Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, what we are dealing with is in fact a new totalitarianism. At question are fanaticism and the negation of human life itself. They want to destroy freedom. They have chosen the path of barbarism and terror. Like many others, my country suffered a tragic blow from them, last March. The fight we must wage against terrorism must be a shared one, uncompromising and intransigent. Naturally, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674). But we must do more and better, systematizing our exchanges of information and intelligence in order to anticipate and prevent such barbaric acts. Freedom must be stronger than the shadows.\nAround the world, there are 65 million women and men who are either refugees or displaced. Countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are on the front lines as hosts to huge numbers of refugees, with all the difficulties that entails. Every continent is involved, and we know what the causes are: war, poverty, climate change. Needless to say, peace and development are the best responses we can make, and we must also ensure the dignity of every human being, with special concern for those who are most vulnerable \u2014 women and children.\nPolitical dialogue and international negotiations are tedious processes, too often slow and strewn with obstacles, with as many steps backward as forward. That often results in frustration and sometimes even a feeling of powerlessness. And yet I believe firmly that inclusive, stubborn, tenacious political dialogue is the surest way to finding lasting solutions. And we should also highlight international diplomacy\u2019s successes. The peace agreement between the Colombian authorities and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, the formation of a Government in Libya, the nuclear agreement with Iran, the diplomatic rapprochement between Cuba and the United States and the fight against Ebola are all examples of progress and success, holding a key to a better and safer life for millions.\nHow true is the saying, often attributed to Nelson Mandela, that a winner is a dreamer who never gives up. I too believe that courage and tenacity are key to advancing peace and ensuring a more secure, more just world. We should never lose hope or abandon ourselves to fatalism.\nThe situation in Israel and Palestine today is yet another illustration of the urgency and importance of reviving the political process in order to arrive at a definitive solution to the conflict. We support a two-State solution, but in the current circumstances, if no fundamental change is made, we know that this prospect may be irretrievably lost.\nWe should put a stop to the acts that hinder such a solution. We condemn the continued settlement activities in the occupied territories. At the same time, we are firmly committed to maintaining Israel\u2019s security, which must be guaranteed. We support France\u2019s initiative aimed at facilitating the resumption of talks. In another essential step, the Palestinians must also advance their own dialogue.\nInternational law cannot be reduced to the law of the jungle. On the frontiers of Europe, the territorial integrity of several countries has been violated by one country alone. It is not acceptable to fan the flames of conflict in order to soothe nostalgic feelings of grandeur. I urge that we work to find a way out of this logic of confrontation with Russia. We have too many interests in common to allow ourselves the luxury of diplomatic paralysis.\nIn the past few years we have made a lot of progress in reducing poverty and improving access to basic health care. But we know very well that there is still so much to do. The Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change have given us a proactive framework to continue making progress, and we should strive unstintingly to implement them. It is our duty to future generations to create a safer world that is more respectful of our planet.\nEconomic exchanges and international trade contribute to worldwide growth and employment. Free enterprise, the private finance initiative and economic exchanges are the foundations of development: they fuel research, technological innovation and even medical progress. We must promote transparency in the fiscal and banking sectors and fight all forms of corruption. Capitalism is not naturally virtuous: just and transparent rules are necessary. However, in many countries employees are not properly compensated for their work. Capitalism is not an end in itself, but an instrument that we must put to use at the service of human development: no more, no less.\nThe global economic situation is constricting State budgets. Work is often too heavily taxed in comparison to other sources of revenue. For that reason, Belgium, along with 10 other countries of the European Union, would like to develop a system to tax financial transactions. We must succeed in removing the technical and political obstacles. It is a question of elementary equity.\nIt is an honour for my country to defend the universal principles and values of liberty, tolerance and dialogue. We fully respect the traditions, cultures and identities of the various peoples of the world, and we believe that universal values are the shared foundation of a fairer and safer world. We believe in the virtues of multilateralism and the persistent search for consensus through political dialogue.\nBelgium is an active, stable and loyal member of the international community. For that reason, we are a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2019-2020 period. I sincerely hope that we can count on the support of a large number of countries in that election.\nI also wish to extend my gratitude to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to peace and security. His intelligence and creativity have meant that he leaves behind a solid legacy. I already have high hopes for his successor, who will, we hope, ensure the proper implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nA politician concerns himself with the next election, whereas a statesman concerns himself with the future of the next generation. Let us strive to meet the expectations of our citizens, fulfil our universal values and act as statesmen.\n"

        "file_text": "North Korea has now openly shown itself to be a threat to peace. How must we respond? The raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations is now being seriously challenged. North Korea has tested submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Immediately after that, it fired three ballistic missiles simultaneously, each traversing 1,000 kilometres to reach Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. It is purely a matter of good fortune that no commercial aircraft or ships suffered any damage during that incident. This year alone, North Korea has launched a total of 21 ballistic missiles. In addition, it claims to have successfully detonated a nuclear warhead in a test on 9 September. That nuclear test followed another test conducted in January. That series of missile launches and the detonation of a warhead completely changes the landscape.\nNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear development and the repeated launches of ballistic missiles are two sides of the same coin. Before our very eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan that is plain to see. It is clear that the threat has now reached a new dimension. We must therefore respond in a manner entirely distinct from our responses thus far. We must act in unison and thwart North Korea\u2019s plans.\nImmediately upon hearing the report of the nuclear test, I telephoned President Barack Obama of the United States. After that I also held telephone talks with President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of Korea. We all agreed that our three countries would collaborate closely and show resolve in our attitude towards North Korea. Now is the time for the United Nations to act. Now is the time for the Security Council to adopt an unambiguous position regarding the unprecedented threat.\nIt was only four months ago that President Obama visited Hiroshima, where countless innocent citizens fell victim to the first atomic bomb ever detonated. It was a day on which we renewed pledges. No matter how long it takes, we must never, even for the briefest moment, let up in our efforts to secure the total elimination of nuclear weapons. On that day, our pledges linked both sides of the Pacific and gained new strength. This notwithstanding, North Korea is now escalating its provocations. It is a challenge that we cannot overlook, as to do so would weigh on our collective conscience.\nPeace is much like glass \u2014 when polished and transparent, we do not see it. A small crack can be overlooked for a while without changing, but before you know it, the crack expands and one day the glass shatters resoundingly. That is why, day in and day out, we must habituate ourselves to handling glass with great care, so that no cracks form. I believe that the original intention of the United Nations, created in the wake of two world wars, was that kind of keen awareness. For that very reason, it would simply be unacceptable to continue to tolerate military provocation, because that would be equivalent to openly cracking the glass.\nMoreover, the threat to peace now plainly manifests itself, and North Korea\u2019s persistent military provocations are far more serious than before. North Korea is, without a doubt, poised to acquire submarine-launched ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. Let us not forget that this is a country that abducted a large number of Japanese citizens, including a 13 year-old girl, shattering their peaceful lives, and to date they have not been allowed to return to their homeland. We have demanded that North Korea return them immediately, but they have refused. This is a country that tramples human rights, where the checks and balances of power are ignored. It is a country that continues to build up its arsenal, which includes missiles and nuclear weapons, while paying no attention to the plight of its citizens. The threat to the international community has become increasingly grave and real. It calls for innovative responses that are altogether different from previous approaches.\nIn December, Japan will mark the sixtieth anniversary of its entry into the United Nations. Sixty-two years have elapsed, if we count from the moment that the toll of the bronze Peace Bell sent by a Japanese citizen began sounding in the front gardens of the United Nations grounds on the International Day of Peace, as it does every year. The bell was cast by melting down coins sent by Pope Pius XII and coins and medals sent by children and adults from more than 60 countries around the world. What was the wish of the Japanese people that accompanied it?\nSixty years ago, when Japan was first seated in this Hall, it wholeheartedly advocated world peace and the elimination of nuclear weapons, as it has done consistently and unfailingly ever since. It was a pledge designed to be passed down from generation to generation, a pledge not to stop walking along the path that would make world peace and the elimination of nuclear weapons a reality.\nOn this occasion today, I had originally intended to look back at the path we have trodden these 60 years and quietly reflect on Japan\u2019s progress along that road, with world peace and prosperity as its goals. However, the North Korea threat is reaching a new level. Therefore, in the light of Japan having upheld its pledge these 60 years, and as the world focuses on whether the United Nations will thwart North Korea\u2019s ambitions or the Security Council will be able to confront North Korea in a united way, I feel I must state that Japan, as a Security Council member, will lead the Council\u2019s discussions. I declare before the national representatives gathered here in the General Assembly Hall that this is our absolute resolve. No matter the issue before us, or how many challenges we are faced with, Japan, as it marks its sixtieth year of membership, will spare no effort to strengthen the United Nations.\nThe cumulative total of the assessed contributions to the United Nations and the assessed contributions to peacekeeping operations that Japan has paid, when their book value is tallied, easily exceeds $20 billion. The only country whose total financial contributions surpasses that of Japan over the past 30 years is the United States. In addition, our track record of development assistance amounts to $334.5 billion, again in terms of the book value.\nAs I see it, the United Nations has historically been committed to three great causes: devotion to peace, the pursuit of growth, and the desire for a world free of injustice and unfairness. I believe members will recognize that Japan is a country that has made all-out efforts to promote all three of those causes over the past 60 years.\nGrowth serves as the foundation for all else. Only when there is growth does peace take root and can injustices be rectified over time. Take a look and see how greater Asia has now surpassed every other region as regards the size of its population living under democracy. This is precisely the fruit of the growth that Asia has been enjoying since the mid-1980s, which happens also to be the time at which Japanese companies began their large-scale direct investments in Asian nations.\nIt was only through a free and open trade and investment environment that Japan was able to grow \u2014 the very same environment that is responsible for the present-day prosperity of the countries of Asia. Peace, stability and safety at sea, together with freedom of navigation and overflight, are the basis for the peace and prosperity of the international community.\nIn the event of disputes, the international community must adhere strictly to the principle that States shall make their claims based on international law, shall not use force or coercion in support of their claims and shall seek to settle disputes by peaceful means. Japan will unfailingly continue to uphold a world order that is open, free and unwavering in its commitment to the rule of law and international norms.\nLet me also say that at the core of the Japanese Government I have formed a special team, which I lead directly, that is working to further the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe Government of Japan will accelerate the work towards early conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and will carry out without fail its pledge to provide \u00a51.3 trillion in assistance for developing countries by 2020. I will make sure that this will be done.\nJapan will spare no effort in strengthening the United Nations in the 60 years to come, just as it did over the past 60 years. I wish to pledge this, grounded in trust in the Japanese people.\nAn unexpected visitor appeared at a worksite in Juba, South Sudan, where members of an engineering unit belonging to the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (SDF) and wearing the blue helmets of the United Nations were carrying out activities. He said to them, \u201cI am really thankful that Japan is building roads. I place my full confidence in you. Isn\u2019t there anything I can do? Let me help you. I don\u2019t need anything in return.\u201d\nAgain the next day, and the day after that, the man appeared at the worksite, where an arterial road was being laid in the capital of South Sudan, the youngest Member of the United Nations. On the third day, the man began doing the work that he knew would be necessary, and he continued working with the members of the SDF for eight days. When they went their separate ways, as they were patting each other on the back and expressing regret that they had to part, it goes without saying that our engineering unit members, who had heard nothing but words of thanks from this man, were deeply moved. Juma Ago Isaac \u2014 the SDF members each wrote the name of this otherwise unknown man from South Sudan in their notebooks to remember him.\nNo matter what the job or where it is, the Japanese engaged in international cooperation always consider this kind of encounter at local worksites to be their real reward. Wherever they go, nameless people become aware of their own abilities and realize that nation-building begins at the very place where they themselves are standing. The Japanese witnessing this are moved in ways that become memories lasting their entire lives.\nIt is a source of quiet pride for me that the relationship between Japan and the United Nations has for the past 60 years brought hearts together in this way in Asia, in Africa and indeed all around the world. This is Japan\u2019s United Nations spirit. I pledge not to forget this and to foster it and hand it down to the next generation.\nI will end my address by pointing out the need for fundamental changes in the United Nations governance structure. Countries in Africa and Latin America have built up a degree of influence they never had before in global politics and the global economy, and yet they do not have satisfactory representation on the Security Council. This single example makes the present composition of the Security Council indefensible to the current generation. The international relations that prevailed 71 years ago, at the end of the Second World War, are now relegated to the history books. They hold no relevance for the countries that have since then achieved their independence. At the sixth Tokyo International Conference for African Development, which Japan and the countries of Africa recently convened, I heard the leaders describe the fact that Africa has no permanent representation on the Security Council as a historical injustice, and I concurred in deep agreement.\nAfrica\u2019s long-term goal is to have permanent members on the Security Council by 2023, which Japan thoroughly supports. If we do not carry out a reform of the Security Council now, it may well be put off for another decade or two. Which position are we to take \u2014 that of undermining the values of the United Nations, or that of striving to strengthen the United Nations? If we choose the latter, then it goes without saying that Security Council reform is a matter of urgency. I will end my address here by emphasizing that point.\n"

        "file_text": "During the past year, the international community concluded landmark agreements on sustainable development and climate change and renewed its commitment to work together to combat violent extremism. Those are the most serious matters before the international community today, and our joint efforts offer the prospect of transforming our world as a whole, not just a part of it. After all, the progress of every country is closely linked to the progress of every other country, and we all have a role to play.\nNow is the time for implementation. We can stay on course if we keep a few things in mind. First, we must always remember that the ultimate purpose of our efforts is to transform the lives of real people by enhancing their well-being, safety and access to opportunity. Secondly, we must build on what we have learned so far. That means being inclusive \u2014 especially of women, because if they are not able to reach their potential, then none of us are. I am proud to be a HeForShe and urge others to support this important campaign.\nWe have also learned the lesson that technology has to be part of the strategy for achieving all the global goals. Everyone in the world needs to have access to high-speed Internet, as the Secretary-General\u2019s Broadband Commission has advocated. Rwanda is pleased to be associated with that effort, and I commend the International Telecommunication Union and UNESCO for the good work that they have done and continue to do. We have also seen the importance of forging meaningful partnerships with the private sector so as to improve the speed and scale of the delivery of Internet services. Such perspectives will inform the work of the new Sustainable Development Goal Centre for Africa, which Rwanda is pleased to host with the support of our partners.\nThere has to be real continuity between the various frameworks that have guided and will now guide our collective action. Those agreements are not slogans or fashions, but hard-won statements of global consensus about the world that we wish to leave to our children. Let us implement them with the speed and seriousness that they deserve.\nThere are encouraging signs of progress on the horizon. Next month, more than a thousand delegates will gather in Kigali to consider a ground-breaking amendment to the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer that would phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a major type of greenhouse gas. The nearly 30-year-old Montreal Protocol is already one of the most successful international agreements in history, and it now affords us the opportunity to take a significant step forward in implementing the one-year-old Paris Agreement. I urge all Member States to join with us to pass that important measure.\nThe world is changing for the better, as the ground is being levelled by technology. The way we relate to each other in the international community also has to change. The preservation of international peace and security depends on maintaining a shared vision of the outcomes that we want for our world and the values that guide our cooperation. That accounts for the continued relevance and durability of the United Nations. Our collective responsibility for the rights and welfare of refugees and migrants should be seen in that light. The issue must be addressed with consistency and compassion at all times. It cannot become a crisis only when the wealthier countries begin to be affected.\nRwanda will continue to play its part. We have gotten many things right, but there is no doubt that we could be achieving even more. If we keep the people whom we are fighting for at the front of our minds and build on lessons learned, there is no reason why we cannot achieve everything that we have committed ourselves to.\nIn closing, I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been a champion of technology and a strong advocate for sustainable development, as well as for other matters that have needed fair treatment. Even in the most difficult situations, he has been a voice of reason, and we wish him well.\n"

        "file_text": "The Co-operative Republic of Guyana congratulates you, Mr. Peter Thomson, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. The election of a representative of Fiji, a small island developing State, to preside over the General Assembly at this session is especially gratifying. The choice of theme for our general debate \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d \u2014 is most appropriate.\nWe thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, outgoing President of the General Assembly at its historic seventieth session, for his guidance of the Assembly over the past year.\nGuyana commends Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his stellar stewardship of the United Nations during his decennium. The international community owes him an enormous debt of gratitude for the earnest efforts he has indefatigably exerted to alleviate human distress, promote peace and sustain development around the world.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s courageous campaign to combat the adverse effects of climate change and his commitment to sustainable development have been transformative. His labours bore fruit in the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in September 2015, and in the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in April 2016.\nThe 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement have had a massive and undeniable impact on the manner in which the world manages the environment. The 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement are evidence of environmental common sense. They are excellent examples of the sort of collective action most likely to ensure a sustainable future and safety for the planet. They are harbingers of hope for everyone, everywhere, forever. The Secretary-General\u2019s leadership has irreversibly led the United Nations further along a green path. We thank him heartily.\nGuyana is part of this global green movement. Our natural assets, our commitment to sustainable development, our contribution to conquering the adverse effects of climate change and our collaboration with the international community in seeking solutions to global threats have distinguished us an emergent green State. We are a State that will ensure a secure future for our people in the pursuit of a green economy. We are a State that is proud of its place as a reliable and cooperative partner in international efforts to protect the earth\u2019s environment.\nGuyana recognizes the interlocking objectives of the Agenda and the Agreement. It realizes that the establishment of a green State is consistent with building climate resilience while mitigating the effects of climate change. Guyana promises to continue to work towards the Agenda\u2019s goals, particularly by contributing to limiting increases in global temperatures, and to work towards a green path of development that is in accord with the Agreement\u2019s nationally determined commitments.\nGuyana serendipitously stands at the centre of the Guiana Shield, one of the world\u2019s last remaining spheres of virgin tropical rainforest. The Guiana Shield spans an area of 2.7 million square kilometres, an area larger than Greenland, and it is shared by six South American countries and territories \u2014 parts of Brazil and Colombia, all of Guyana, all of French Guiana, all of Suriname and part of Venezuela. Guyana, as a part of that Shield, is a net carbon sink. A green canopy of rainforest envelops more than 85 per cent of our land mass, the second highest percentage forest cover on earth. Guyana is pursuing a green path so as to better understand how to protect its precious biodiversity and sustainably manage its complex ecosystems.\nGuyana made a covenant with the world to be an exemplar of green growth in 1989, three years before the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. We made a gift to the prospect of sustainable development and to the project of protecting our environment through a generous grant of 371,000 hectares of our pristine forests, to be used as an international model for research, training and the development of technologies that will promote the conservation and the sustainable and equitable use of tropical rainforests in a manner that will lead to lasting ecological, economic and social benefits for the people of Guyana and the world in general. The Iwokrama International Centre for Rainforest Conservation and Development, located in the centre of our country and at the heart of the Guiana Shield, survives and thrives as a testament to Guyana\u2019s commitment to sustainable development and environmental conservation.\nGuyana is an important partner in the global environmental movement. It entered into an agreement with the Kingdom of Norway to provide the world with a relevant, replicable model of how the United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the Role of Conservation, Sustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks in Developing Countries (REDD-plus mechanism), the mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, can align the development objectives of forest countries with the world\u2019s need to combat climate change. It has also entered into agreements with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and other States, and international organizations.\nGuyana reaffirms its commitment to Goal 15 of the Agenda under which States Members of the United Nations pledge to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss. Guyana is improving the management of its ecosystems and natural resources in order to conserve its forests and their rich biodiversity. We will fulfil our obligation under the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions set forth in the Paris Agreement.\nGuyana will continue its research by establishing an international institute for biodiversity at the Iwokrama International Centre for Rainforest Conservation and Development. That institute will allow scientists and\n16-29296 23/56 students from the Caribbean and around the world to come to our country to increase their knowledge of vital ecosystems and share in the study of the Guiana Shield and its amazing biodiversity.\nGoal 13 of the Agenda calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. This goal envisages and encourages international cooperation to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and abate the adverse impact of climate change. The Agreement obligates Member States to take action to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse-gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production.\nGuyana is developing a comprehensive emissions- reduction programme as part of its responsibility to contribute to global solutions in the face of the threat of climate change. We will set aside an additional 2 million hectares of our territory for conservation purposes. Guyana is pursuing a low-carbon growth trajectory to enhance its contribution to the campaign against climate change through the preservation of its forests, within the ambit of the REDD-plus mechanism. It will contribute up to 48.7 million metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalents to the global mitigation effort, through an avoided-emissions programme.\nThe Agreement on climate change and the Agenda both emphasize the importance of financial flows in supporting the efforts of States pursuing a green path to development, so that they can meet their adaptation and mitigation obligations and implement the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. I must state, however, that all our efforts \u2014 nationally, regionally and globally \u2014 for the advancement of development in an environment of peace and stability, are being challenged by the territorial ambitions of our neighbour, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\nGuyana celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence this year. Regrettably, Venezuela acknowledged this anniversary by reasserting, on 26 May, our independence day, its repudiation of a border treaty that it had solemnly signed 117 years ago and ratified and respected for over 60 of the years since then.\nI addressed the Assembly last year and warned of the danger that Venezuela posed to the peace and security of our region due not to its internal instability, but to its external assault on Guyana\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity (see A/70/PV.16). I placed my hopes in the fact that the process for the final resolution of Venezuela\u2019s unworthy territorial claims rested now in the hands of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Since my address last year, Venezuela has used every means to stall, as it has intensified its aggression against Guyana and thwarted all of the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to pursue a way forward, at least in terms of a process that would lead to a final resolution of the controversy.\nGuyana stands ready to have the International Court of Justice reach a final determination on the matter. We will work resolutely with the Secretary- General in his final months of office, and with his successor, to free Guyana from this surreal burden. In the Geneva Agreement of 1966, Venezuela agreed that the Secretary-General would determine the means of settlement of this controversy, including by judicial settlement. Yet Venezuela defies his every effort to fulfil that commitment.\nThe United Nations cannot be a dispassionate party to a threat to peace anywhere and to a challenge to the law of nations. Venezuela\u2019s territorial claim is such a challenge. It strikes at the heart of the United Nations. It strikes at the heart of the United States trusteeship of the law of nations. It strikes at the heart of the United Nations Charter, which the Secretary-General is sworn to uphold. Guyana, a small State, must look to the United Nations for protection against threats to its security, for intervention, for peace and for respect for international law.\nMy plea for international understanding of our plight has nothing to do with Venezuela\u2019s internal situation. The ordinary people of Venezuela are our sisters and brothers. Their pain touches our hearts, and we wish them early relief from their agony. However, Venezuela\u2019s claims are a threat to Guyana\u2019s existence as an independent nation. They are a scandalous revival of the disease of the conquistadores that once plagued Venezuela\u2019s own history. They are a crime against our humanity, clothed in the verbiage of national honour.\nI also wish to iterate Guyana\u2019s ongoing support, within the context of the preservation of sovereignty and its link with sustainable development, for the complete removal of the commercial, economic and financial blockade imposed by the United States against another Caribbean country, the Republic of Cuba. We cannot commit to policies that transform our economies with a view to providing development for our peoples and not demonstrate the political will necessary to change systems that are in direct contradiction to those policies.\nGuyana is on a path to becoming a green State. However, its efforts \u2014 and those of other small States \u2014 will be derailed unless there is collective commitment by the greater part of the international community to collaborate with those States determined to pursue a low-carbon, low-emissions path to sustainable development and to stopping the rise of global temperatures.\nThe road from Stockholm in 1972 to Paris in 2015 has been long and difficult. However, the words of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment remain as relevant in 2016 as they were 44 years ago, in 1972:\n\u201cA point has been reached in history when we must shape our actions throughout the world with a more prudent care for their environmental consequences. Through ignorance or indifference we can do massive and irreversible harm to the earthly environment on which our life and well- being depend. Conversely, through fuller knowledge and wiser action, we can achieve for ourselves and our posterity a better life in an environment more in keeping with human needs and hopes... To defend and improve the human environment for present and future generations has become an imperative goal for mankind ...\u201d (A/CONF./48/14/Rev.1, para. 6).\nThe General Assembly at the seventy-first session now has the opportunity and the obligation to commit to measures to defend and improve the human environment for present and future generations, thereby making the road forward into the future an easier one for posterity. Venezuela\u2019s aggression against Guyana should not be allowed to threaten our children\u2019s future.\n"

It was an honour for Denmark to assume the presidency of the Assembly at its seventieth session, and we thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his excellent work. We wish President Thomson every success in leading our crucial work in the year ahead.\nWe live in volatile times. It is therefore up to all of us to strengthen international cooperation and make it more effective. We must do so in order to foster a peaceful, sustainable and rights-based international society built on the ambitious common goals that we have adopted this fall.\nWhile the challenges facing the United Nations today may seem daunting, our recent record does give cause for optimism. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, have demonstrated our ability to come together to address today\u2019s global challenges. However, our task now is to turn our shared agenda into real change that will benefit people around the world. With a new Secretary-General coming into office, this will be a pivotal year for the United Nations.\nDenmark has always believed that global challenges must be addressed through effective collective efforts, with a sharp focus on the rights and freedoms of the individual human being. Denmark has a vision for action that is based on three core elements \u2014 dignity, development and dialogue. Those elements characterize our approach to the work of the United Nations and will guide our candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the 2019-2021 term.\nAround the world, many people are denied a life of dignity. Armed conflicts and violent extremism have led to human rights abuses and violations in several parts of the world. Syria, Iraq and the Sahel region are experiencing some of the most serious and urgent crises facing us today. In many other places, violence and instability are causing immeasurable human suffering. Millions of people are subject to oppression, slavery and trafficking by the dark forces of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other extremist groups, which requires a strong and determined collective response.\nIn Mali, Denmark actively contributes to the promotion of peace and stability. We donate to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and are engaged in long- term development cooperation with the country. In Syria and Iraq, Denmark contributes significantly to the fight against ISIL, including through support for local communities in the aftermath of conflict. We must ensure that military achievements against ISIL are followed up with determined and coordinated efforts to sustain peace. Without such efforts, we will not succeed. This autumn, Denmark will launch a new three-year regional stabilization programme for Syria and Iraq. The main focus will be to support immediate stabilization efforts in areas of Iraq that have been liberated from ISIL.\nOur common security also depends on nations adhering to the norms and rules laid out by the United Nations, whether in the General Assembly, the Security Council or other organs and agencies. All countries must abide by their obligations under international law, including on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In that regard, Denmark condemns the recent nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and urges the international community to respond in a strong and unified manner.\nIn the past week the world came together to address the mounting challenge of millions of people forced to flee from their homes due to armed conflict, natural disasters or poverty. A staggering 65 million people were displaced in 2015, requiring a determined and effective response from the United Nations. Denmark welcomes the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), adopted last week, which underlinines the principle of shared responsibility and the importance of addressing the fundamental causes of migration. Denmark is among the largest per capita humanitarian donors in the world, and we will continue to do our part. Poverty and a lack of opportunity are among the underlying factors leading to conflict and instability; they are also key factors in driving people from their homes.\nDelivery on sustainable development and the eradication of extreme poverty are vital avenues towards a free, peaceful, prosperous world and in addressing the fundamental causes of migration. Denmark\u2019s development cooperation is a concrete testament to our commitment to the United Nations and to assisting the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. Since\n16-29823 39/53 1978 \u2014 for almost four decades \u2014 Denmark has been meeting the target of providing 0.7 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance. We strongly urge many more countries to meet the same goal.\nA pre-eminent challenge on the path to sustainable development is climate change. We must all take up the challenge of turning the commitments set forth in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change into action, to bring about immense and positive change for the planet and for people. All of those present in this Hall can count on Denmark to be at the forefront in that endeavour \u2014 in terms of follow-up both at home and internationally. The Danish Government will put forward a motion for ratification of the Paris Agreement in the Danish Parliament on 5 October.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved only if cooperation is integrated across different fields and sectors. The United Nations development system must be reformed and made truly fit for purpose. The United Nations system must completely rethink its operational approach. The silo mentality and internal competition for resources must become phenomena of the past.\nDenmark firmly believes that we need a significantly strengthened focus on the role of young people. The 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development is essentially an agenda for future generations. Accordingly, the engagement of the world\u2019s young people in its implementation is indispensable. Young people possess enormous potential and must be involved in the work ahead.\nWe also need civil society, academia and the private sector to support policy implementation and provide innovative solutions and know-how. We need to engage in fruitful public-private partnerships to push implementation even further.\nGovernments can play an important role in further encouraging private business and investors to contribute to implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why the Prime Minister of Denmark last week announced a new Sustainable Development Goals investment fund. The goal is to raise capital from private investors and reach a capital base of up to $750 million. Investments will be made across the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 to improve energy, climate mitigation, industry, infrastructure, food production and health care in order to generate sustainable growth, jobs and tax revenue in developing countries.\nIn addition, we need global free trade as an essential element in fostering long-term development and economic growth. Denmark is actively advocating for creating better market access for developing countries and improving business conditions, including at the World Trade Organization. In short, if goods pass borders, it is less likely that soldiers will.\nThe effectiveness of the United Nations system, and indeed our ability to turn the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals into reality, begins and ends with the willingness of Member States to work together. Addressing global challenges through dialogue is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations, and it resonates with Danish political tradition. That is why, from the beginning, we have been deeply engaged in building up the Organization. This is also true in very concrete terms, as the Trusteeship Council Chamber, located next to this General Assembly Hall, was designed by the Danish architect Finn Juhl, whose design was precisely intended to foster dialogue among delegates, thereby promoting the democratic mission of the United Nations. In all modesty, we think he succeeded quite well.\nMore than 50 years of partnerships in international development with an approach based on dialogue has taught us the value of partnership in ensuring progress. As just one example, Denmark has for decades been a strong supporter of national human rights institutions and commissions, ombudsmen and other independent human rights bodies, from the Middle East to Africa and Eurasia.\nGender equality and the empowerment of women, key requirements for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, are a cornerstone of our foreign policy. Studies show that, when a girl receives just one additional year of education, she can increase her earnings by up to 20 per cent. That is important, not only for her but also for her family, her community and her country.\nDenmark was extremely proud to host the Women Deliver 2016 Global Conference in Copenhagen, earlier this year. The Conference was a testimony to the importance Denmark places on ensuring women\u2019s and girls\u2019 full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. A plethora of programmes, initiatives and strategies were showcased at the Conference, providing inspiration for women and men all over the world.\nAt home and abroad, Denmark promotes the human rights and values of indigenous peoples. We stand for their right to control and influence their own development paths and determine matters regarding their own economic, social, political and cultural situation.\nDenmark is one of the strongest voices in the global fight against torture. For decades we have ensured the successful adoption of General Assembly resolutions that further the work on the elimination of torture, as laid out in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Implementation, however, is key. That is why we \u2014 together with Chile, Ghana, Indonesia and Morocco \u2014 have launched the Convention against Torture initiative. Our goal is to work towards universal ratification and better implementation of the Convention by 2024.\nAs the people\u2019s Organization, the United Nations needs to do better to foster trust, transparency and efficiency. I am proud that during Mr. Lykketoft\u2019s presidency of the General Assembly important steps were taken to increase transparency in the work of the Office of the President as well in the selection process for the next Secretary-General. If the United Nations is to remain a relevant and legitimate organization for peace, development and human rights, we must continue on the path of increased openness and transparency. That is in the shared interest of all Member States.\nIn conclusion, allow me, on behalf of the Government of Denmark, to take this opportunity to also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. Denmark salutes the progressive leadership and determination that the Secretary-General has displayed through a difficult and very challenging period in the history of the United Nations. He has tirelessly led the way to finding viable solutions to global challenges, in particular climate change, which has been a journey that led us from Bali to Copenhagen and, finally, to Paris, and which resulted, last December, in an ambitious global agreement to fight climate change. Denmark reiterates its appreciation for the progressive leadership and determination of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\nIt is of the utmost importance that the new Secretary- General show the same determination as his predecessor in forcefully addressing the challenges posed to the millions of displaced persons, refugees and migrants across the world, while ensuring the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and undertaking the necessary crucial reforms of the United Nations. As we strive to reform the Organization, Denmark will stand by the side of the next Secretary-General and continue to support and take active and constructive part in the critical work of the United Nations going forward.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Thomson on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at this session, and I would like to assure the President that he will haveour complete support for a successful session. It is also my pleasure to pay a well- deserved tribute to the previous President, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the transparent and dynamic approach with which he led the activities of the General Assembly during its seventieth session.\nOn 25 September 2015, in this Hall, the leaders of the world put together their vision for the world for the period up to 2030 by adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. At the heart of that Agenda lies an ambition for the international community to work tirelessly to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions so to create inclusive, fair and prosperous societies that are respectful of the environment and human rights. Such an ambition clearly initiates a shift in the paradigm for development, which is rendered necessary not only by the multiple challenges that face humankind, but also by irreversible relationships of interdependence.\nA review of the world in which we live today does not inspire great optimism. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow. The number of massive population displacements is also on the rise. Various crises and conflicts emerge and sometimes persist, making our planet ever more vulnerable to climate change. Such developments are alarming, and they require a global, integrated, cohesive and concerted approach that links words to actions tot launch a collective effort consisting of vigorous and sustained actions aimed at achieving the sustainable prosperity of humankind. In that regard, we would like to welcome the President\u2019s choice of a theme for this session: \u201cSustainable Development Goals: a new impetus to transform our world\u201d. That theme will, we hope, lead to the creation of the necessary foundations on which we can move towards those goals.\nThe scarcity of financial resources available for development is cause for the reappraisal of official development assistance so as to make it more effective, particularly for the most vulnerable countries. Such development assistance will help to make those countries more resistant to economic, social and environmental shocks, both inside and outside their borders. In that framework, Africa is the continent with the youngest population in the world and the most vulnerable countries, which should be especially borne in mind as we implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nTo reduce its vulnerability and build up its resistance to shocks, Africa will need deep structural transformation in order to develop a dynamic private sector \u2014 an engine for development. The development and implementation of public policies should fully involve the creation of employment and economic opportunities for the most vulnerable parts of the population, specifically women and young people, so as to include them effectively in socioeconomic life and enable them to develop their potential. Substantial investment in making women and young people more independent is needed, particularly because the scourges of terrorism, extremism and intolerance, as well as trafficking in illicit arms and drugs, all accentuate the misery and weakness of the most vulnerable parts of the population.\nPartnerships and innovative financing schemes are needed to accelerate dynamic growth in Africa. New technologies must, therefore, serve the interest of sustainable development.\nChanging the economic model on the African continent is impossible without sustainable access to energy. That is a challenge for Africa. Today, seven out of ten Africans \u2014 a total of 700 million Africans \u2014 do not have access to electricity. That is why the Heads of State and Government of the African Union countries decided to work with the support of the international community on a robust plan to accelerate the electrification of the continent through renewable energies, so that we can move from 25 to 80 per cent access to energy in 10 years. A fund devoted to financing renewable energy in Africa has been put in place to collect contributions for Africa within the framework of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nAs a spokesman for Africa on renewable energies, I would like to call on the international community, particularly financial institutions, to work with our continent in implementing those objectives so that we can build a strong African continent that is respectful of commitments to the environment and sustainable development.\nDevelopment can be sustainable only with peace and stability. Peace and stability cannot be ensured without development. We therefore need to state that peace, an essential asset for the harmonious development of humankind, continues to face great challenges.\nTerrorism has struck around the world, threatening peace and international stability. We firmly condemn the barbarous acts that have struck Mali, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, France, Turkey and Pakistan, to name just a few. We reiterate our deep sympathy for and solidarity with all countries affected by such instances of obscurantism. We are convinced that, although one might try to defeat terrorism using military means alone, it cannot be prevented or contained except by significant socioeconomic investments aimed at reducing radicalization.\nIn the Middle East, terror and mindless violence have led to desolation in Syria and Yemen, while the international community has still not managed to reach a sustainable resolution to the conflicts in the region. Our collective passivity regarding the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process also dangerously reduces the possibilities for a successful resolution to the conflict. Guinea has always unambiguously expressed its unconditional solidarity with the just Palestinian cause, and we are convinced that the solution needed in the Middle East must be based on two States living peacefully, side by side, within internationally recognized borders.\nRegarding the embargo that has for a long time afflicted Cuba, we encourage all efforts to normalize relations between that country and the United States.\nOn the African continent, new and old crises \u2014 often fratricidal \u2014 continue to undermine stability. We welcome the support extended by this Organization to build peace in Africa, specifically in Central Africa and Mali. Guinea has actively contributed to the efforts of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali through the deployment of a battalion of 850 men in Kidal. However, it has paid the heavy price of losing nine soldiers to violent attacks committed by terrorist groups that are threatening the stability of the region. That is why we ask, while maintaining respect for the sovereignty of States and the peacekeeping mandates, for the adoption of a legal framework that endows the United Nations with stronger power regarding counter-terrorism. That will enable international forces to improve their intelligence capacities in order to better defend and fight back against terrorist attacks. With that in mind, the President of Liberia and I recently carried out a mission in Guinea-Bissau. In that regard, a preventive, coordinated, concerted and coherent approach on a daily basis seems required so as to be able to grasp the profound causes of such crises and the factors that help perpetuate them.\nWe welcome the adoption on 27 April of the almost identical resolutions \u2014 General Assembly resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282 (2016) \u2014 on the United Nations peacebuilding architecture, with particular emphasis on prevention and the integration of women and young people in all sectors of activity in our societies. Guinea \u2014 which, at its request, was inscribed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission in 2011 \u2014 believes that such a framework offers us the opportunity to evaluate the nature and scope of our collaboration with the Commission in order to keep it in line with our needs.\nIf I may, I will share with the Assembly some aspects of the current situation of Guinea. After two stressful years, Guinea became free of the transmission of the Ebola virus as of 29 December 2015. The fight against Ebola was difficult and arduous, but our efforts, supported by the international community, have put an end to that terrible disease. I would like to pay tribute to the solidarity shown by other countries affected by the epidemic. The victory against Ebola belongs to everyone and is something that we should all celebrate.\nHowever, the road before us is long, because the epidemic has greatly undermined all economic activity in our country. The most vulnerable people, particularly women and children, have been made even more vulnerable, and our challenges lie in the need to ensure their social reinsertion. The virulence of the disease has identified the weaknesses of our health-care system and the sectors that need special attention in order to ensure the resilience of our people and our continent.\nTherefore, in the context of the post-Ebola recovery, Guinea has developed its strategy, which was presented here, along with those of Liberia and Sierra Leone, at the International Ebola Recovery Conference organized by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We wish to express our gratitude to our partners who have fulfilled the pledges that they made at the Conference, and invite others that have not yet done so to make their promises a reality, so that Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will be are able to reconnect quickly with sustainable development.\nDespite the Ebola epidemic, the people of Guinea have demonstrated remarkable resilience and solidarity. That has allowed us to pursue many reforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law and at developing a framework conducive to investment and governance that inclludes all components of society. On the macroeconomic front, after a long period of fiscal restraint, the country has just concluded its eighth and final review with the International Monetary Fund.\nThe United Nations remains the only viable alternative for the promotion and emergence of prosperous and inclusive societies that respect human rights and the environment. Nevertheless,we cannot deny that our Organization must constantly reform its bodies and its working methods so as to be able to address threats to peace and security and the challenges of underdevelopment and to assist in the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI wish to conclude by paying tribute and expressing our sincere gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and immense contribution to the world that we are all aspiring to build. We thank him for his tireless efforts and dedication, particularly with regard to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Those agreements will certainly form a significant part of the legacy of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Next year at this time, general elections will have been held in the Bahamas. That means that this is the last time that I will address the General Assembly in the present term. For me, it has been a special privilege \u2014 one that I have cherished since I first stepped up to this rostrum back in 2002. I wanted to do something special this year, which is why I have the honour of having with me some of my constituents from the Bahamas, and in particular some of the religious and civic leaders of the community of Fox Hill, which I represent: Reverend J. Carl Rahming and Mrs. Rahming, Bishop Carrington Pinder and Mrs. Pinder, Reverend Hartman Nixon and Mrs. Nixon, Reverend Daniel Hall and Mrs. Hall, Reverend Warren Anderson and Mrs. Anderson and Reverend Sherelle Saunders. I also recognize the opposition\u2019s spokesman on foreign affairs, the Shadow Minister Hubert Chipman MP and his wife.\nIt is the policy of the Government of the Bahamas that there should be, insofar as is possible, a multi-partisan consensus on foreign affairs so that there is a seamless transfer of ideas and policies among the parties. Furthermore, the civic leaders are here because I wanted to show them that, contrary to a prevailing narrative, foreign affairs is not some esoteric academic discipline, but is a real-life exercise connected to the real lives of the people in my constituency and to all the ordinary people around the world. I am glad that they are here.\nJack Lew, the Treasury Secretary of the United States, talked in a recent television interview about the value of starting a bank account, the value of saving and the importance of the involvement of ordinary people in the economy of his country. It was a telling message. But throughout the Caribbean \u2014 where the tradition has been to provide a child at birth with a bank account as a gift at the christening \u2014 it has become very difficult for a child, not to mention an adult, to open a bank account, so much so that many argue that there is a disincentive to joining the financial system.\nIndeed, not only is that a problem in the Caribbean, but a British Minister told me about how one of the leading politicians in his country could not open an account for his 12-year-old daughter because she is what is called a politically exposed person. That is obviously wrong. The problem is that the overregulation imposed on countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has led to negative unintended consequences. Suddenly, being a politician or in a politician\u2019s family is to run the risk of being refused normal banking services around the world because the risks are too high. That is wrong.\nI started my remarks with that concern in order to bring home starkly what all countries from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) region have described as the dangers of de-risking. What I have described is a part of that whole cloth. Banks in the developed world, principally in the United States, are in some cases refusing to cash the checks of some Caribbean banks because they say the risk of policing the CARICOM banks on the issue of compliance with the new rules is too high and the business that banks get from such transactions is too low. So, such services have been stripped away across the Caribbean.\nThis is the same Bahamas and Caribbean that tens of millions of people from the United States and Europe visit every year. The visitors expect that all the modern conveniences and services will be available when they land to dip their toes in the water and sun themselves on the beach. The Caribbean islands that are described in their tourist brochures as paradises are being treated by the developed country banks as if they are Sodom and Gomorrah thanks to the new financial rules. The financial regulators use pejorative expressions like \u201ctax havens\u201d and impose unfair rules and sanctions on those societies, which may prevent valuable remittances being sent to people back home or prevent the payment of the school fees of Bahamian and CARICOM students abroad. While such destruction is being wrought on those same small countries, they are being asked and lobbied to vote for one cause or another in the interest of the developed countries. But what many of our leaders and peoples are asking is, \u201cWhere is the quid pro quo in all of this?\u201d\nNo CARICOM country, including the Bahamas, is shielding anyone involved in unlawful behaviour. All applicable agreements are adhered to and are complied with in connection with money-laundering and the unlawful evasion of taxes. The attacks on the Bahamas and the CARICOM region are inaccurate and unjust. The recent attacks in the press about the Bahamas financial services sector are simply reprehensible and represent violations of international norms. We reject them. Normally, one does not seek to make a moral case in this forum. But there is a dubious moral equivalence that is being argued by the developed countries. They argue that, even though they have laws regarding the protection of privacy and private property from illegal seizure by the State, even though our countries are independent and free to do as they wish, the fact that our countries serve as bankers for those seeking to take advantage of tax competition is somehow immoral because it robs the developed world of legitimate revenue. But that is simply not true.\nThe evidence is that the wealth accumulated in offshore sectors goes back to the developed countries and the offshore sectors are therefore of benefit to the developed world. We can present another moral argument. If the societies of the Caribbean collapse because of overregulation by other countries, then the result of the destruction of millions of families would be the greater moral wrong. If one then argues that it is immoral to evade one\u2019s responsibility to pay taxes at home \u2014 we agree \u2014 we argue that you have a moral responsibility to understand that overregulating, changing the goalposts, not creating a level playing field in the financial services sector and de-risking can bring about an immoral result. That problem must be solved by those who imposed the regulations. It is a moral imperative.\nThe Bahamas has been pleased to join the United States of America and others in the Safe Ocean Network, a global initiative aimed at all aspects of the fight against illegal fishing, including detection, enforcement and prosecution. On last Wednesday, I had the privilege of depositing our instruments of accession to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. The desire for the safe governance of the oceans has also informed the decision of the Bahamas to seek another term on the Council of the International Maritime Organization, where we have established a reputation for upholding the highest standards of maritime safety, security and environmental protection. I ask for the support of Member States for the re-election of the Bahamas to that Council.\nWe need a broadening and modernization of the development-financing indicators used to assess development level and development needs. We have stated, and continue to argue, that gross domestic product per capita should not be the primary determinant that determines whether a country qualifies for international economic assistance or concessional access to development financing.\nAs a demonstration of the importance that the Bahamas attaches to the advancement of women, Ms. Marion Bethel was nominated for a seat on the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and was elected in May. We believe that Ms. Bethel will contribute to CEDAW\u2019s efforts to advance women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality. We expect that her experiences on that body will increase knowledge in the Bahamas relative the advancement of women.\nA more vexing problem is how to ensure that young males in our society do not fall behind. In all areas of academics, young males struggle to survive and keep up and prepare for participation in our societies. The Government has turned its attention now to remedial measures to ensure that they do not fall further behind. I am proud to say that there are two young males from the Abaco Islands who have joined us as the winners of a student contest that enabled them to win an opportunity to see this event. They are joined by a young female.\nWe are proud to see them here. There is a larger fight for the integration of all young men and women into the formal economy. Young people are the future, and we have to ensure that they understand and see that those processes are included in the general economy.\nI am pleased to announce that the Bahamas is seeking election for membership in the Human Rights Council for the term 2019 to 2021. I ask for the support of all Member States for the Bahamas to be elected to that Council.\nEach day, our country of 400,000 people faces incursions from Haiti and Cuba by people seeking a better way of life. Those incursions are unsustainable and expensive to police and prevent. That is why we are working with Cuba and Haiti on that sensitive and vexing issue, as well as with the United States, which is the destination of choice. That is also all the more reason why attention must be paid to closer and more normal relations between the United States and Cuba. We will also support the continued call for an end to the economic embargo on Cuba when the vote comes before the United Nations shortly. Our country is really pleased that elections will be held in Haiti next month. The Bahamas has pledged to provide observers to those elections.\nWe wish to thank the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, vision and tireless efforts. We thank him for his service and wish him well in the future.\nWe are in the midst of the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent. The CARICOM region and the Bahamas are largely an African diaspora. During the decade, we have seen a man of African descent become the head of the most powerful country in the world. Thousands of Bahamians and people across the Caribbean took pride in that example of success. We wish him well as he leaves office.\nThere was a picture of a little black boy in the Oval Office of the United States. In the picture, the President is bending down and allowing that boy to touch his hair. The little boy, it seemed, wanted to be sure that someone like him with hair like his was actually the President of the United States. That is the background against which people of African descent encounter negativity all around the world. Thousands of little black boys and girls in the Bahamas have taken the success of the President of the United States as an affirmation of hope.\nThe wave of shootings by police officers in the United States must not be allowed to damage that image of that country. We think that it is imperative for our closest neighbour, the United States, to understand that in the International Decade for People of African Descent it must do the right thing.\nThe President of the United States affirmed that he believes in a liberal democracy. We support that position. All of the CARICOM countries, including the Bahamas, are shining examples, without exception, of liberal democracies. They feature ideological pluralism, capitalist economies, multiparty States, regular elections, independent judiciaries with low levels of institutional corruption and regular public consultations on policies. This world body, then, has a stake in ensuring that the societies of the CARICOM region survive. Michael Manley, the late national hero of Jamaica, made that point in this very forum many decades ago.\nThree successive Popes \u2014 John Paul II, Benedict and Francis \u2014 have all decreed that capitalism must operate with a moral conscience. Our countries all operate within that milieu. The Christian values of tolerance and respect for the sanctity of the individual and the rule of law remain firm. The millions of tourists who visit the region can attest to that fact.\nI end where I began, on de-risking and the issues of climate change. With so many positive attributes, why does it appear that so much is being done to ignore and undermine the success of our societies, which are shining examples of what the world says that it desires? It is morally perplexing and legally indefensible. We are small, and we have no armies to deploy to impose a result. We cannot force results. To paraphrase an American judge, we have only our voice and with that voice we say today: the moral cry for help is the moral demand for rescue. The United Nations is where we have a level playing field. It is the appropriate forum to make our case. That is so whether the issue is banking, financial services, climate change, sustainable development, financing for development, migration or simply survival.\nScripture tells us: \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs\u201d. It also says, \u201cWhatever you did for the least of these, you did for me.\u201d Therefore, as a representative of \u201cthe least of these\u201d, we use our moral voice today to say that now, more than ever, we need the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, from this same rostrum, at the seventieth anniversary session of the General Assembly, much was said concerning the critical turning point in world development. The keynote was the recognition that humankind is moving from a bipolar and monopolar world order towards multipolar and democratic systems of international relations with regard to dealing with common challenges and threats, which we can overcome only through joint efforts. It was rightly stressed that there is a need to change the very philosophy of inter-State communication by avoiding attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of States or to impose development models on countries and peoples.\nUnfortunately, despite having acknowledged that fact, many Western countries continue to favour their entrenched ideas of mentoring, dominance, exclusiveness and the realization of self-interests by any means, rather than promote just and equitable cooperation. We see, in the bloodshed in the Middle East and North Africa, the consequences of such arrogance and their sense of infallibility in their pushing forward unilateral and reckless solutions to complex conflicts. As a result, the foundations of world stability are being destroyed. It is high time to draw the necessary lessons and avoid sinking into catastrophe in Syria.\nLargely thanks to Russia\u2019s military response and assistance at the request of the legitimate Government of Syria, it has been possible to prevent the collapse of that country\u2019s statehood and the disintegration of the country under the onslaught of terrorists. Our involvement provided the impetus for the establishment of the International Syria Support Group, which seeks to start a meaningful political process so that the Syrians themselves can determine the future of their country through an inclusive dialogue among all ethnic and religious groups. That is uncontestable. It has been acknowledged in the relevant Security Council resolutions and is enshrined in the recent agreements between Russia and the United States as Co-Chairs of the International Syria Support Group. We thank everyone who has supported us in those efforts.\nIt is now essential to prevent the collapse of those agreements and to carry out an unbiased and impartial investigation into the incidents in Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo, which undermine the agreements, especially given that there are quite a few people wishing to sabotage both the agreements and a settlement of the conflict in Syria. It is crucial to comply with the demand of the Security Council to separate what is known as the moderate opposition from the terrorists. And, in that regard, a particular responsibility lies with the United States and the members of the United States- led coalition.\nIf we truly wish to resolve the Syrian crisis and the appalling humanitarian situation there, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Jabhat al-Nusrah and associated extremist groups must be suppressed. That is key to reaching a cessation of hostilities and national reconciliation. Today, it is unpardonable to put off intra-Syrian negotiations, as well as to impose preconditions to them. Everything must be done in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).\nSabotaging the process \u2014 in particular through the use of external forces, including their advisers and supporters \u2014 has a negative impact on the reputation of the United Nations and leads us to believe that the reason for it lies in an attempt to change the regime. We have seen that sort of zero-sum game in Ukraine, which is very close to us, in the unconstitutional attempts to overthrow the Government and now in Ukraine\u2019s refusal to fulfil the Minsk Agreement of 12 February 2015. By and large, the attempt to use those conflicts to achieve self-serving geopolitical goals has been obvious to everyone.\nThe latest meeting of the International Syria Contact Group gives us reason to remain very cautiously optimistic. More broadly, it is only through the genuine implementation of all agreements that we will be able to have, in the Euro-Atlantic area, equal and indivisible security for mutually beneficial cooperation, as was stated at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe nearly 20 years ago.\nNeither NATO nor the European Union will be able to replace a truly collective unification of efforts in the interest of all without losers and winners. And it is also utterly unacceptable to hold athletic competitions \u2014 which have always brought peoples together, strengthening friendship and mutual trust \u2014 hostage for reasons of political ambition. Attempts to manipulate the outcome of competitions does not honour those who flaunt their allegiance to fair competition but actually violate the General Assembly principles supporting the independence and autonomy of sports.\nIn today\u2019s world, we cannot be guided by the philosophy of the anti-heroes of George Orwell\u2019s dystopic novel Animal Farm, where all animals are equal but some are more equal than others. In the enlightened twenty-first century, it is simply indecent to adopt the role of mentor to everyone else, reserving for oneself the right to use doping in sports, launch unilateral adventures bypassing the United Nations, conduct geopolitical experiments that cost millions of human lives, engage in the extraterritorial blackmail of everyone, including one\u2019s closest allies, while what is really intended is to advance one\u2019s own financial profit, or even to set the criteria for the greatness of a particular country. All of that is unworthy of the principles of freedom and equality, on the basis of which great nations have grown and which are now being used by their elites to threaten the entire world.\nThis year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal decisions. The anniversary cautions us against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and reminds us of the catastrophic consequences of attempting to determine the fate of the world by suppressing the legitimate interests of other States and peoples. The freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly should not be used as a cover for condoning radical movements that profess a Nazi ideology and support the glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices. The persistence of such vicious instincts dictates the need for consistent efforts to place a solid barrier in the way of neo-Nazism and revanchism, strengthen inter-ethnic and intercultural accord and rally the young generation around the ideas of justice and equality. We invite everyone to take part in the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in Sochi in October 2017.\nHegemony has no place in the future, if we want it to be a just future that gives people the opportunity to choose their own ways of development. That entails the need to learn to respect one\u2019s partners and respect the cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world. We must therefore return to our origins \u2014 the norms and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other instruments of the world Organization. Our commitment to that approach was reaffirmed in the Declaration of the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Promotion of International Law, signed on 25 June. The observance of the principles of the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in their internal affairs should become a measure of the decency and legitimacy of any member of the world community.\nWe cannot address the global issues of countering international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other transboundary threats without abandoning the philosophy of exclusiveness and permissiveness. There should be no place for double standards in fighting terrorism. Truly universal joint efforts are required to create a broad counter- terrorist front, as President Putin proposed from this rostrum last year (see A/70/PV.13). The tragedies in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria have proved the need to stop opportunistic attempts to use extremists as a way to advance geopolitical intentions. Before it is too late, it is necessary to think about the task of preventing the proliferation of terrorist and extremist ideology, which literally holds youth hostage in various regions of the world. We are drafting a Security Council resolution aimed at mobilizing efforts to eliminate such evils. We are looking forward to support for our initiative.\nThe elimination of the breeding grounds for radicalism would be facilitated significantly by resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is important to overcome the deep deadlock, which is stipulated in the 1 July 2016 report of the Quartet of Middle East facilitators. We call for the implementation of its recommendations.\nWe are also seriously concerned about non-proliferation and arms control. There have been attempts to replace the key objectives of maintaining strategic stability in all its components with populist slogans of \u201cnuclear zero\u201d. We see a number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals not participating in the existing treaties. The fundamental Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is being put to a serious test. Its parties find it more difficult to speak a common language, especially in a situation when certain nuclear Powers torpedo any compromises regarding the start of the negotiations on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East.\nRussia has consistently supported the liberation of humankind from the threat of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. However, progress towards nuclear disarmament must be made in the context of the full consideration of a whole set of factors that affect strategic stability, including the impact of unilateral global missile defence systems, the development of strategic non-nuclear strike weapons, the threat of the placement of weapons in outer space, the inability to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the growing imbalance in conventional arms in Europe.\nWe note the growing support for our initiative to draft an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism. The start of serious negotiations on that issue and on the Russia-China draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space would help break the impasse in the key body of the United Nations multilateral disarmament architecture: the Conference on Disarmament. We call for substantial examination of our proposals to improve the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons.\nNATO member countries brought conventional arms control in Europe to a deep deadlock. Our attempts to save it have faced a tough ideology-driven counteraction. All ideas to return to that issue would be meaningful only if NATO countries recognized the absolute futility of ultimatums aimed at achieving unilateral advantages. We continue to be open to an equitable and mutually respectful dialogue with NATO, including through the Collective Security Treaty Organization.\nIt is necessary to work towards strengthening stability and equal and indivisible security in other parts of the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. The recent actions of North Korea, which violate Security Council resolutions, must be stopped. We call on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear-missile programmes and return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime. However, it is inadmissible to use that situation as a pretext for a massive militarization of North-East Asia and a deployment of another set of United States global missile-defence systems. All sides must refrain from the further escalation of tension and embark on the way toward a political and diplomatic settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula through the resumption of the talks.\nWe will continue the dialogue within the framework of the East Asia Summits on the establishment of regional security and cooperation architecture in the Asia-Pacific region based on non-bloc foundations. A number of participating countries, including Russia, India, China and Indonesia, have submitted their views on that topic.\nWe invite the countries of the region to agree on the ways to implement the initiative presented by President Putin to establish an extended Eurasia Partnership with the participation of the Eurasian Economic Union countries and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other interested States. I would like to underline that the aforementioned initiative is open and fully in line with the earlier plans to create a trade bloc between Russia and the European Union and is founded on the basis of World Trade Organization norms and principles, unlike other projects involving close trade blocs that undermine the unity of global trade systems.\nWe will continue to promote the unification agenda in various international forums \u2014 the United Nations, the forum of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa group, the SCO, and the Group of 20 (G-20). The recent summit in Hangzhou reaffirmed the status of the G-20 as a leading global economic and financial forum. We thank the Chinese chairmanship for its efforts to use that representative platform effectively for the exchange of views on the key issues of the global economy and on policies for the subsequent promotion of such agreements in the universal format of the United Nations.\nThe signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has become an important event among United Nations activities. The communication of nationally determined contributions on a voluntary basis moves us toward achieving the objectives of the Agreement, namely, to hold the increase in the average global temperature to below 2\u00b0C. Clear rules and procedures to implement the provisions of the Paris Agreement, bearing in mind the interests of all countries participating in the process, should be developed in order to achieve success.\nIn that context, the launch of market and non-market mechanisms to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, as stipulated in article VI of the Agreement, is a priority matter. In the final analysis, that would be of crucial importance in preventing violations of the competitive environment and the transfer of polluting industries and dirty production from one country to another, which hampers the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe United Nations was established to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and develop equitable international cooperation. Today, that covers all areas of international life, including communication, political and military aspects of security, climate protection, conflict settlement, peacekeeping, ensuring human rights and freedoms, sustainable development, regulating information technology, and efforts to combat terrorism, drug- trafficking and corruption. Furthermore, it includes issues ranging from the eradication of infectious diseases to ensuring the social responsibility of businesses and fostering scientific and technological progress.\nIn addition, of course, the United Nations must promote civil dialogue, thereby strengthening pluralism, cultures and traditions and serving as a catalyst for progress in science and the arts. In essence, we are talking about preserving humanity in all of its riches and diversity. That goal should constitute the basis for our collective efforts. It should become an imperative for global development and an incentive for improving global governance and the true democratization of international relations.\nI would like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has made enormous efforts, in his position as Secretary-General, to renew the United Nations through timely actions. We believe that the new Secretary-General will also make a valuable contribution.\n"

        "file_text": "I am once again participating in the regular session of the General Assembly to reaffirm our respect, admiration and congratulations to our brother, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his contribution to the life of the peoples of the world and of Mother Earth. We appreciate and express our deep respect for his work as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I am also here to reiterate that we are living in a time of renewed global obscurantism, spurred by the capitalist and imperialist barbarism that is killing human dignity, the integrity of our common home, Mother Earth, and the sovereignty of our countries.\nMr. Sogavare (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nToday, according to United Nations data, some 94 per cent of the world\u2019s wealth is in the hands of a mere 20 per cent of the global population. More than 800 million people in the world are suffering from hunger. This grim social reality is the true face of capitalism. Humankind\u2019s main goals during this century should be to eradicate capitalism and imperialism as the prevailing societal model. If we do not build another model of society as soon as possible, the Sustainable Development Goals will be replaced with the sustainable goals of death for all living things and Mother Earth.\nThis year has been the hottest in the history of the planet, and each year is hotter than the previous one. This year, Bolivia is also experiencing one of the worst droughts in history. We have to be alert and take immediate action to prevent the barbarism of capitalism from transforming the Paris Agreement into an agreement of lies and blackmail.\nThe capitalist countries have built borders and walls everywhere \u2014 on water, on land and in the air. One out of every 100 people in the world is either a refugee or someone displaced by global warming, wars or imperialist invasions, as occurred in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other countries. We hope that all of the world\u2019s peoples can start building universal citizenship and one great country where people live in harmony and as part of a common family.\nThe expansionist and warmongering policies of the State of Israel and its allies are major expressions of barbarism in the modern world. We strongly condemn Israel\u2019s attacks on the civilian population of Palestine and demand that Israel cease hostilities immediately. We urge the United Nations to fully and immediately recognize the State of Palestine and take tangible action to stop the brutal genocide of the Palestinian people.\nWe return to the General Assembly to express our strong rejection of the coercive and unilateral economic measures imposed by the United States against Cuba for political reasons. It is not sufficient to restore diplomatic relations. The United States must compensate Cuba for the economic blockade and restore Guantanamo to Cuban territorial sovereignty.\nWe commend the signing of the peace agreement between the Colombian Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. It shows that we are fulfilling the promise of membership in the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States \u2014 to make our region a zone of peace. We must never forget that peace can be achieved only with social justice. We highlight and admire Cuba\u2019s leadership in facilitating the peace agreement.\nWe lament the fact that other Governments, such as that of the United States, perpetrate attacks, such as the most recent bombing of military positions in Syria, which left dozens of soldiers dead or wounded. It shows the hypocrisy and the ongoing non-compliance with the commitments they undertook in the Syrian ceasefire agreement, announced by Russia and the United States on 9 September in Geneva.\nWe condemn terrorism, violence and war, but in order to eliminate terrorism, we must attack the root causes of this scourge for humankind. It must be said that as long as wealth remains in the hands of a few, as long as poverty and exclusion exist, as long as racism and discrimination persist, as long as the identity and the sovereignty of peoples are not respected and their natural resources are pillaged for imperialist purposes, there will be grounds for violence and terrorism. We must build a world of peace and equality with dignity and brotherhood among peoples.\nMany brother countries have been affected by the global economic crisis. In Bolivia, however, we have developed policies and are taking measures to deal with the repercussions of the global crisis in the capitalist system. Bolivia is leading economic growth in South America, as it is one of the countries that has achieved complementarity among economic growth, distribution of wealth, public investment and a significant reduction in poverty while expanding equality. None of this would have been possible without the sovereign measures it has taken, such as the nationalization of our natural resources and strategic companies.\nImperialist interests are creating a process of political destabilization in our region. We condemn foreign political intervention in our brother country of Venezuela. We salute the revolutionary fight of the people, undertaken with their leader, Commander Maduro. The new imperial conspiracy in the twenty- first century is no longer through coups d\u2019\u00e9tat but rather through parliamentary or judicial takeovers. They may be legal and constitutional, but they are not legitimate, nor do they respect the decisions of the people.\nWe express our deep concern about and rejection of the actions taken by the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), which are in breach of the basic principles of the United Nations. The Organization of American States needs to be a true representation of the all the countries of the Americas, and not an agent or mouthpiece for the interests of the United States. We do not need an imperial leader to control our people. If the OAS does not represent or respect, the sovereignty of its member States, it would be better if it did not exist at all.\nLast week, on 18 September, the Heads of State and Government of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement met on Margarita Island, Venezuela, and strongly condemned action taken by the United States of America relative to its Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015, which involves implementing extraterritorial measures that violate the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to inform members of the Assembly that Bolivia, without military bases or the presence of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), is now faring better in the fight against drug trafficking, and this fact has been recognized by the United Nations.\nI also note that thanks to a few police officers of our armed forces, we learned the following: when the DEA was in Bolivia, when it seized drugs, 50 per cent were burned and 50 per cent went to DEA for trade. A Bolivian officer inquired about the latter 50 per cent, and the response was that the DEA used the money to pay off our police. Investigations that were conducted proved that the DEA was training police and military personnel to plan the assassination of leaders. For these reasons and many more, I would like to tell those present in this Hall today that terrorism and drug trafficking are twins that serve the imperial interests of the United States, which seeks to invade and control other countries around the world \u2014 I am completely convinced of this.\nFurthermore, I recall that in 1879, the Bolivian coast was invaded by Chilean and English transnational military forces with a view to taking the substantial natural resources there by force. For more than a century, Chile has expressly and repeatedly rejected the pressing need for Bolivia to once again be a coastal country, and it has undertaken to negotiate with Bolivia the restitution of maritime access.\nBolivia has relied in good faith on all the legal commitments undertaken, which served as the basis of our claim brought before the International Court of Justice. The Court declared its jurisdiction over the matter on 24 September 2015, after the Government of Chile presented an objection regarding said jurisdiction. We understand that these are times of dialogue, that we must work together on solutions that will allow us to resolve pending matters peacefully and with the full involvement of the people. We invite Chile to put an end to one of the longest-lasting conflicts in the history of Latin America, whose solution continues to be an outstanding debt between our nations. The solution to the conflict will benefit not only Bolivia but Chile and the integration of Latin America as a whole. We are certain that we will find a solution whereby everyone is a winner.\nI would like to thank the organizations of the international community and the various presidents, former presidents and peoples of the world for their ongoing support for Bolivia to regain sovereign access to the sea. I would also like to highlight the fact that the United Nations created an institution of such importance, the International Court of Justice, so that international conflicts and controversies could be resolved peacefully. We trust that the Court will serve justice.\nOur greatest wish is to see the message of Pope Francis become reality \u2014 to establish channels of dialogue and tear down the walls that divide us. We want to launch a dialogue that satisfies the mutual interests of our countries. In Bolivia, we are building a country that will be an exemplar of equality, liberty with dignity, and sovereignty for the world. For these reasons, we insist and will continue to insist that all basic services must be recognized as human rights, and that, further, we recognize and respect the rights of Mother Earth. The new world order with social justice must be built on the foundation of fraternity among nations and harmony with Mother Earth for the well- being of all of us.\n"

        "file_text": "In taking the floor at the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, I would like first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his fitting election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish him every success as he carries out his functions. I also extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, the outgoing President, for all the innovations introduced to the Assembly and for his work in general. In particular, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is attending the general debate of the General Assembly for the last time as Secretary-General. I thank him for his contribution to conflict resolution in the world and his 10 years of service to humankind. I wish him every success in his future endeavours.\nToday the world is witnessing an overwhelming and unrelenting wave of migrants fleeing conflict areas, particularly in Iraq and Syria \u2014 as well as from Africa to Europe \u2014 trying to find a safe and quiet place to live. Terrorism continues to leave innocent victims in its wake in every region, thereby constituting a real threat to the well-being and development of humankind. Political instability is endangering the lives of thousands of human beings in many countries. The economic crisis is becoming increasingly worse and more unpredictable, thus negatively affecting the growth and social and economic development of our countries. The crisis is having particularly strong impacts on developing countries, where there are still communities that suffer from hunger, malnutrition and extreme poverty. In a world as complicated and complex as ours is today, the role of the United Nations is more essential than ever.\nTherefore, united, we must bring about true democracy within our Organization. United, we must protect our planet for the sake of our offspring. United, we must respect and help one another. United, we must give priority to human values, not only in terms of respect of human rights but also in terms of respect for the rights of humankind. As such, we will be able to strengthen our United Nations and ensure a better future for generations to come. As policymakers we run the risk of incurring our collective historical condemnation if our ambition and sense of superiority continue to lead us down the path of destroying our own human species, polluting our planet and shattering the foundations of peaceful coexistence, to which future generations are entitled.\nBy 2030, the States Members of the United Nations should have transformed the lives of all and conserved our planet. That is the goal and commitment that the leaders of our Organization undertook at the seventieth session of the General Assembly in September 2015 by adopting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets. Indeed, there is an urgent need to achieve the Goals, each and every one of which is necessary and essential for the development of a decent life for every human being.\nThe Common African Position on the post- 2015 development agenda has been very useful in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. It identifies substantive issues of importance for Africa, which were the basis of a consensus on the priorities, concerns and strategies of Africa that was reflected in the outcome of the negotiation process of the 2030 Agenda.\nWith regard to progress made in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, in keeping with its ambition to become an emerging country by 2020, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has fully integrated the Sustainable Development Goals into its Horizon 2020 programme. With the programme, the Government is giving priority to its economic and social transformation through developing human capital and inclusive and sustainable growth. In recent years, important progress has been made in all sectors.\nIn the health-care sector, the World Health Organization has qualified Equatorial Guinea as one of the few countries in the region that has been able to considerably reduce the risks leading to maternal and infant mortality during pregnancy and childbirth, thanks to the practice of preventive medicine and free vaccinations. Children, pregnant women and the elderly receive free health services and equal access to drugs.\nIn the economic arena, Equatorial Guinea is focusing on diversifying its productive sector, thereby creating jobs for youth in such areas as industrial fishing, agriculture and hydrocarbon exports, all of which is aimed at improving the quality of life of the people. Through a programme of water, electricity and health care for all, citizens throughout the country have access to drinking water, electricity and health services.\nAt the international level, we would point out the Government of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s donations to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to fight hunger on the African continent and its donations to the World Health Organization to fight the Ebola pandemic and improve the health of the victims in the most affected countries.\nAs the General Assembly can see, although much remains to be done, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has made great strides in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, in part thanks to the good use of resources from the hydrocarbons sector, which is the main source of income for its economy.\nIn tandem with the implementation of the Development Goals, we note that many citizens of countries in our Organization continue to live in insecurity and fear and under threat. The refugee crisis requires a new approach. We value and commend the decision adopted by the Governments of several Western African and other countries to receive and help the refugees start a new life.\nAs the Assembly will recall, on 3 September 2015, the photos of young Aylan Kurdi, only 3 years old, who died on the sands of a Turkish beach after drowning \u2014 may God rest his soul \u2014 moved us all and appealed to our deepest human feelings. A 13-year-old Syrian immigrant also appealed to us when he appeared before the microphones of the international press and said,\n\u201cPlease help the Syrians. We do not want to stay in Europe. Stop the war in Syria, and you will not see us here\u201d.\nWe believe that the statement made by the young Syrian must give us new direction in our efforts towards confronting the migration crisis that we are experiencing today. We recognize that the policy of partnering with one of the belligerent parties and supplying them with weapons can only lead to death, suffering, destruction and the attendant migrant and refugee crisis. That policy has caused many years of suffering in so many countries that were once stable and peaceful models of coexistence but are now experiencing the worst human tragedy in their history.\nWe must again choose the path of dialogue, rather than that of weapons procurement. We must put an end to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We must resolve conflicts by other means and promote a culture of peace, not of violent confrontation. When any person suffers, it concerns us all. When one nation is at war, we are all at war and there is no peace.\nAs President John F. Kennedy stated in his commencement speech at American University, on 10 June 1963,\n\u201c[G]enuine peace [is] the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living \u2014 the kind that enables man and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children ... not merely peace for [some] but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace for all time ...\n\u201cFor, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d\nI am the representative of a country that aspires to a seat in the Security Council within two years. Since our accession to national independence on 12 October 1968, almost 48 years ago, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has not yet had the privilege of membership of the Security Council. Duly endorsed by the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, held in Johannesburg in July 2015, our country became, for the first time, a candidate for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the 2018-2019 term. The election will be held in June 2017. From this rostrum, the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea requests the determined support of all States Members of the United Nations for our candidacy. The Government of Equatorial Guinea pledges to live up to the task and to work for a more just, more humane and more peaceful world.\nWith respect to reforms that are absolutely necessary for the United Nations, we regret to note that, 71 years after the United Nations was established, Africa continues to lack permanent representation at the highest level of the Organization. Seventy-one years later, Africa continues to be denied the right to a voice, vote and veto among the group of permanent members of the Security Council. That is not fair for a continent that comprises 54 Member States, a population of 1.1 billion people and whose issues constitute the majority of the topics discussed in the Council.\nI cannot conclude without congratulating, once again, the Government of the United States of America for the major step taken in restoring dialogue with the Republic of Cuba. We therefore call on the Government and the people of the United States of America to finally and definitively lift the embargo against the Cuban people, to enable that country to have the means to fully participate in the national and multinational implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe foregoing is the message entrusted to me by His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo for delivery to the General Assembly, to which I offer my best wishes for success in its work to achieve a more peaceful, more humane and more democratic world. May God bless the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and may God bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson and his friendly country, Fiji, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish him every success during his presidency, which he has promised would be one for the whole Assembly. Such a promise, if kept, would strengthen the neutral role of the President of the General Assembly and shed a bright light on facts that some are trying to conceal.\nAs we meet once again, our world is going through a grave and dangerous period. Terrorism, which we have cautioned against repeatedly from this very rostrum, has continued to grow and gain ground, claiming the lives of more innocent people and causing death and destruction as it rages unabated across the world. The blood of Syrians was not enough to quench its thirst. It had to go after the citizens of many other countries, including those that have supported and sponsored it. These innocent people are now paying for the mistakes of their Governments, which have ignored the interests of their people and adopted short-sighted policies.\nFor more than five years, the Syrian people \u2014 no matter their affiliations \u2014 have paid dearly for the crimes of terrorists who have shed their blood and undermined their security, stability and livelihoods. Terrorism has spared no one, even targeting schools and universities, hospitals, places of worship and infrastructure. Everyone knows that terrorism would not have spread through my country if it had not been for the external support of certain countries. As is no longer a secret, these have included Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which have promoted their jihadist takfiri ideology and their death fatwas that have nothing to do with Islam. They have bragged about supporting terrorism in every way possible, sending into Syria thousands of mercenaries equipped with the most sophisticated weapons.\nMeanwhile, Turkey has opened its border to admit tens of thousands of terrorists from around the world and has provided them with logistical support and training camps under the supervision of Turkish and Western intelligence. It has even supplied those terrorists with direct military support, as was the case in Idlib, Aleppo and rural Latakia. I would like to refer the Assembly to a study published seven months ago by a German institute, the Firil Center For Studies. According to that study, more than 360,000 foreign terrorists from 83 countries have entered Syria since April 2011. By the end of 2015, the Syrian Army was able to kill 95,000 of them, while 120,000 returned home or travelled to other countries.\nIn Syria, we are combating terrorism on behalf of the entire world. Every time the Syrian Army kills another foreign terrorist, it spares the lives of the innocent people who could have died in terrorist acts committed by that same terrorist upon his return to his native country. Anyone who tries to distort that fact must be held responsible for the spread of terrorism and the increasing numbers of victims. Our valiant Army deserves to be commended and supported. It must never be the target of schemes and lies.\nThe terrorist campaign against my country is taking place in the full view of a polarized world. There are those who have chosen to support international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, while others have decided to turn a blind eye to the truth and to support, finance and arm terrorists under false pretexts that depart from logic and reason. They choose, for example, to refer to those terrorists as moderate armed opposition, even though there is irrefutable evidence that the groups have committed against Syrians crimes and massacres that are no less barbaric than those of Da\u2019esh or A1-Qaida. Some consider people who take up arms against the State and its citizens legitimate opposition as long as they are located in Syria, while the same people, on any other day and in another country, would be considered terrorists, or at least outlaws.\nThese facts notwithstanding, all Syrians \u2014 the people, the Army and the Government \u2014 will not relent in their fight against terrorism. They are more determined than ever before to eliminate terrorism wherever it exists in their country and to rebuild a better Syria, because they are well aware that their homeland will cease to exist if the terrorists and their backers emerge victorious. Our belief in victory is even greater now that the Syrian Army is making considerable strides in its war against terrorism, with the support of the true friends of the Syrian people, notably the Russian Federation, Iran and the Lebanese national resistance. Such support has helped to strengthen the resilience of Syrians and to alleviate their suffering. We truly hope that other countries will soon wake up and realize, before it is too late, the danger that threatens us all.\nWe have always welcomed all international efforts to counter terrorism in Syria, but we stress once again the need to coordinate such efforts with the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian Arab Army that has been combating terrorism on the ground for more than five years. Without such coordination, any action would be considered a breach of sovereignty, a flagrant interference and a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter. Without such coordination, any action will fall short of achieving real results and will even make matters worse.\nIn that regard, the Syrian Government condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack launched by American warplanes on a Syrian Army site in the vicinity of the Deir ez-Zor airport on 17 September. That attack allowed ISIL to gain control of the site. The Syrian Government holds the United States fully responsible for that aggression, because facts show that it was an intentional attack, and not an error, even if the United States claims otherwise. This cowardly aggression clearly proves that the United States and its allies are complicit with Da\u2019esh and other terrorist armed organizations.\nWe also reiterate our condemnation of the Turkish incursion into Syrian territories under the pretext of countering terrorism. That flagrant aggression must be stopped immediately. Terrorism cannot be fought by replacing one terrorist organization with another. One cannot but wonder how a State that has been the main entry point for terrorists and weapons into Syria can claim to be fighting terrorism. How can there be genuine and effective international counter-terrorism cooperation while relevant Security Council resolutions remain dead letters?\nSince the onset of the crisis in 2011, the Syrian Government has declared that any solution must follow two parallel tracks: a counter-terrorism track, and a political track through an intra-Syrian dialogue that allows Syrians to determine the future of their country without foreign interference. All solutions dictated from the outside are categorically rejected by the Syrian people. Likewise, no political solution will succeed unless the necessary foundations and conditions for its implementation have been laid, including intensified counter-terrorism efforts and progress in the national reconciliation process \u2014 a strategy which has proved successful in a number of areas around Syria.\nDespite all the hurdles created by the regional and Western States that have sided with the self-proclaimed Syrian opposition, we have always been open to a political track that would stem the bloodshed and end the prolonged suffering of Syrians. We reiterate our commitment to moving forward on the Geneva track, under the auspices of the United Nations. We recall our constructive position with regard to the political solution. Such a solution must be based on respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria and the unity of its people. It should begin by establishing a government of national unity comprising representatives from the Government and the opposition, in all its factions, and tasked with establishing a constitution-drafting committee. Once the new Constitution had been approved by Syrians through a referendum, parliamentary elections would follow and the new Government would be formed under the new Constitution.\nIt is truly regrettable that some are exploiting the humanitarian tragedy and suffering of Syrians, especially in terrorist-held areas, and politicizing such suffering to achieve certain goals that have nothing to do with humanitarian principles or the interests of the Syrians themselves. Some countries continue to shed crocodile tears over the situation of the Syrians in some areas, accusing the Syrian Government of employing a policy of sieges and starvation. At the same time, the same countries continue to support and arm the terrorists who are besieging civilians in the same areas, from the inside, using them as human shields and preventing the delivery of or confiscating humanitarian aid.\nMake no mistake \u2014 no one is more committed than the Syrian Government to ending the suffering of the Syrian people and providing them with a life of dignity, wherever they may be and without exception. That is a duty and not a favour. We will spare no effort to that end, including in cooperation with the United Nations, despite all the difficulties that we are facing as a result of the systematic destruction by externally supported terrorist organizations, and despite the unilateral coercive economic and financial measures imposed on the Syrian people by the very parties that falsely claim to have the interests of the Syrian people in mind. Such unilateral measures have adversely affected many vital sectors, including health care, education and energy.\nToday, while Syria is confronting mercenary terrorists on its territory, it has long confronted a different kind of terrorism \u2014 the terrorism of Israel, which has occupied a precious part of its land in the Syrian Golan since 4 June 1967. Our Syrian Arab people in the occupied Golan continue to suffer as a result of Israel\u2019s oppressive and aggressive practices. Those practices are no longer confined to the occupied Golan but are currently affecting the security and life of Syrians in the southern part of the country. Israel is directly intervening militarily to assist the terrorist organizations operating in the area in every way. Syria calls on the international community to put an effective end to all such practices and compel Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 497 (1981) on the occupied Syrian Golan.\nThe United Nations should also compel Israel to allow the Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable rights, including the establishment of their own independent State, with Jerusalem as its capital, and the return of Palestinian refugees to their land, in accordance with internationally recognized resolutions.\nSyria reaffirms that Israel\u2019s aggressive policies threaten not only Syria, but the region in general, especially given Israel\u2019s nuclear arsenal. We have stressed time and again the need to compel Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other treaties on weapons of mass destructon (WMDs) and to subject its nuclear installations to the oversight of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nSyria stresses the right of States to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We have always called for creating a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. In fact, we have efficiently and responsibly eliminated all chemical weapons in Syria, in cooperation with the Joint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations. In that regard, Syria reiterates its readiness to continue its cooperation with the Joint Investigative Mechanism, as well as to continue the relevant Syrian investigations.\nWe congratulate Cuba and Iran on reaching agreements to lift the embargoes imposed on them, and we look forward to their implementation. We renew our call for removing the illegal economic measures imposed on the Syrian people and other independent peoples in the world, notably the peoples of the Democratic Republic of Korea, Venezuela and Belarus.\nIn closing, we wish Member States and their peoples lasting security and prosperity. We hope that our Organization will be able to regain public trust around the world by upholding the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, which calls for respecting the sovereignty and independence of Member States and ensuring non-interference in their internal affairs. That principle, if implemented, would lay the foundations for genuine and fair relations among nations after the greed and arrogance of some have shaken them to their core.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly today on behalf of the Republic of Serbia.\nFirst of all, I must say that I am profoundly grateful to all those present in the Hall because I know that there can be little excitement regarding my speech. Nevertheless, from time to time it is necessary for us to listen to one another. The general debate is an opportunity to highlight the numerous achievements of the world Organization in previous periods. At the same time, it is an opportunity to jointly reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as our readiness to strengthen our collective resolve to engage actively and to do more to promote peace and security, sustainable development and human rights in the interest of humankind as a whole.\nThe Republic of Serbia strongly supports the proposed theme for this year\u2019s general debate.\nMy country firmly believes that productive multilateralism is not only necessary but also achievable if we all demonstrate readiness, in a spirit of cooperation, compromise and flexibility, for joint engagement in the task of realizating the strategic vision of a better world for all of us. Political will is the first step in that direction, but it must be followed by both measures and practical activities. It is our deep- seated belief that this is the only way forward in a world of growing interdependence and complexity, where common challenges require common solutions.\nWe believe that peace is the foundation for all our common endeavours in fighting poverty, unemployment, organized crime, corruption, violence and all kinds of extremism; in fighting for a better world based on universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and human rights and freedoms that apply to everyone, regardless of differences in race, gender, language or religion.\nIt seems to me that my words are familiar and that many other people have mentioned the same things. I therefore have an obligation to be as brief as possible, so I will not read my official speech but instead will hand out copies of it. I will speak to the Assembly in a different way. I will not use the teleprompters, as many speakers smarter than I have done in this debate.\nComing from a relatively small country in the Western Balkans, in the heart of Europe, and representing today a proud, dignified and freedom- loving people, I am very proud to have an opportunity to be speak here. I am very proud to see people in this great Hall who are ready to listen to those of us who come from small nations. There is no reason for us to address our own public to gain political points; we have enough votes to legitimately represent our people.\nWe have heard many impressive words from the representatives of the big Powers, but we have not heard in this general debate any suggestions for real solutions to some very important issues.\nFirst of all, we have heard almost nothing about a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis, which affects almost the entire world. Coming from a very small country in the Balkans, we have been waiting for a proposal by the big Powers. We will always agree with them and be ready to do our job together with them. Even though my country is not a State member of the European Union, we have been ready to participate in its quota system. However, nobody within the European Union accepted that system. But now we do not know what our policy on that issue should be, because countries differ as to their policies. We should share the same values, but instead completely different solutions leave us with no idea how to negotiate all the bumps in the road ahead.\nI must also add that the migrant crisis is far from over. It has just begun. Today, Serbia is currently facing a greater number of difficult issues than it faced a year ago. Today, we have more than 7,000 migrants within our borders. Bulgaria has the same number. Those people cannot go anywhere else because all the other countries have already closed their borders. I have a question for all delegations. Are there any common solutions for us? Is there something that we can all do together? There are some steps that we can take for ourselves and by ourselves. We will do that, but we will continue to await a common, comprehensive solution from both the European Union and the United Nations, because the current situation is not coming to an end. It will not end in a few days, a few weeks or a few months.\nWe call the Assembly\u2019s attention to a few other issues. Delegations know that my country has faced many difficulties over the past 25 years. During the past 100 years, I think that we did not miss a single war, from the first Balkan War to the most recent wars in the 1990s. I hope that in the future we will have enough strength to overcome all disputes and to do more for our people and their economic development.\nWe recently succeeded in delivering better economic results. For the first time in our contemporary history, we have a surplus in our budget. After many years of crises, we will have a growth rate that exceeds 3 per cent this year, and we expect even better growth rates in the years to come. That does not compare with the growth rates of some countries in Asia and Africa, like the country of my friend the Prime Minister of Mauritius, but it is still better than the average growth rate in Europe, and we are very proud to be able to say that today.\nI have been highlighting various issues because we are once again facing instability in the region, which could jeopardize almost every gain we have made. This is something I have been signalling for the past two years. To tell the truth, we have received a great deal of support from the United Nations and all our friends \u2014 in the West and the East \u2014 but still the situation in the Western Balkan region has not improved. That is why we worry a lot, and why I think that we need to invest even more effort, more time and more of our political will to overcome all the difficulties, disputes, quarrels and enmities inherited from the past.\nWe have faced some terrible insults from some of our neighbours. I will not reply to them in kind today. They have said that my people are a handful of poor, miserable wretches. These are things nobody should say about any nation anywhere. We have decided not to respond to them, and we will stay on that track. We will not be so gross about anybody, even though we may be insulted and offended again.\nWhy am I saying that? I am saying that because I think that the Western Balkan region needs peace, stability, better understanding and real reconciliation in the future. Have we succeeded in that over the past 20 to 25 years? I dare say we have not, or not entirely. Hatred is even more bitter among the people of some countries in the Western Balkans, but at least we have succeeded in preserving the peace and maintaining calm and tranquillity. We will do our best to keep up the pace, to stress economic development and to preserve and develop our political relationship in a different way than we used to.\nOnce again, we are very thankful to those nations that were not on our side, but on the side of international public law. They did not support the unilaterally proclaimed independence of our southern province, Kosovo and Metohija. We are profoundly grateful to the Member States that abided by the United Nations Charter.\nWe are persistent in continuing our dialogue and conversations with Kosovo Albanians, because we need to live together. We need to create a common future. These talks are facilitated by the European Union, and we are deeply committed and dedicated to carrying on with them. We will remain ready to inform the Assembly about the results of these conversations, and we hope that the situation in Kosovo and Metohija will not be a source of instability in future. That is at least one good conclusion from my speech of today.\nThere are several other issues at stake. We face various dangers, and many factors could jeopardize our future sustainable development. There is a greater presence of terrorist cells in various countries in the Western Balkans, and, together with the rest of the world, we will do our best to fight that terrible evil. That is why we joined the coalition to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. I am proud to say that we will always be with the better side of the world, the side of the world that will preserve peace, stability and the values for which the modern world is fighting.\nSerbia will do its best not only to protect its own national and State interests but also to listen to the other small and relatively small countries, because we need to unite; otherwise I am very much afraid that our voice will not be heard in future.\nI think that the General Assembly can be satisfied that, at least in the past three or four years, we have all been hearing that Serbia is a pillar of stability in the Western Balkans. We are proud of that fact. That will remain the case for the next 5, 10, 20 years, and I hope that we will be able to create a better world and better cooperation, particularly among us smaller countries in the world. We will do our best, at least from our side, to listen and to see what we can achieve all together.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. He may rest assured of Indonesia\u2019s commitment to contributing to his successful tenure at the helm of the General Assembly.\nThe theme of the general debate \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d \u2014 is appropriate as we move forward with our shared commitment to maintaining and building on the momentum that we achieved last year. Indonesia attaches great priority to the issue of development, particularly sustainable development. Through the commitments and the setting of global targets in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), the world has made considerable progress in achieving development for all. The MDGs have been an important guide for countries to eradicate poverty. The time frame for their realization added a much-needed sense of urgency for the global community.\nToday we have a new set of global goals and time frames. The transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a comprehensive global framework for sustainable development for us at the national level and for the international community to act as one. The issues the Agenda addresses are broader than those covered by the MDGs. The Agenda reflects the challenges faced by countries at a national level, while simultaneously committing the international community to addressing global challenges.\nIndonesia is fully committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda. We have taken concrete measures such as mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our national development plan; finalizing legal and institutional frameworks for national implementation, while engaging all stakeholders, including local Governments, academia, civil-society and philanthropic organizations; and developing national and sub-national action plan guidelines, the SDGs database and monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms.\nHowever, the implementation of the MDGs had taught us an important lesson, namely, that national commitments need to be complemented by strong and robust international cooperation. In that regard, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda must be supported by organizing a strong global partnership, one that makes a transformative difference to the efforts to advance sustainable development. The global community must also provide sufficient means for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Such means include stable and predictable funding mechanisms and innovative approaches for financing development.\nIf we are to achieve our 2030 Agenda, we need an enabling environment. I am sure that we are all familiar with the phrase \u201cpeace is a prerequisite\nfor development\u201d. Basically, the phrase means that without peace, security and stability there can be no development. From our experience in the 1950s and 1960s, Indonesia can attest to the statement\u2019s veracity. Internal conflict and regional strife with our neighbours turned Indonesia\u2019s focus away from development.\nToday we are seeing much of the same in many parts of the world. A lack of peace, security and stability have resulted in far too many of our brothers and sisters having to struggle for their basic survival, sometimes in unimaginable and inhumane conditions. Increased tension between countries and unresolved territorial disputes, if left unrestrained, all increase the risk of open conflicts.\nReal and constant threats from terrorism, extremism and radicalism continue to haunt us. A divisive \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset is giving rise to racial prejudice, stigmatization and religious intolerance. The long list of non-traditional challenges that profoundly affect humankind continues to grow, ranging from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing to drug trafficking, and from people smuggling and trafficking to cybercrime.\nIn addition, we continue to helplessly watch the suffering of the Palestinian people. Despite the overwhelming support for a two-State solution, the Middle East peace process remains resistant to moving into gear. Unprecedented humanitarian challenges, such as the phenomenon of refugees and irregular migration, resulting from the situation in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and other parts of the world, continue. Almost daily, we must confront a 24-hour news cycle, with the networks presenting us with images of world\u2019s stark reality \u2014 the blood, tears and vacant stares of the most vulnerable, our children.\nAll of that is taking place against the backdrop of a slowing global economy. The World Bank has downgraded the global economic growth forecast from 2.9 per cent to 2.4 per cent. The gap between rich and poor is increasingly widening. At the same time, environmental degradation and climate change continue to accelerate, directly affecting island States and the most vulnerable countries.\nAll those critical challenges must be seen for what they are \u2014 global and massive challenges. In the face of these great challenges, it is our commitment and our efforts that will prevail. No one country or region alone can resolve these challenges. What we need are global solutions, global partnerships and global solidarity. More than ever before, we need the United Nations \u2014 an Organization that is at the centre of our global governance, an Organization that is transparent, effective, accountable, efficient and representative.\nIn that regard, United Nations reform is key to making the Organization stronger and more relevant to confronting the challenges and reality of the twenty- first century, and to eliminating the silo mentality that characterizes the way in which the Secretariat carries out its work. There have been too many important players left out of the United Nations decision-making processes, too many instances where the principles of democracy are put aside. Too often the decisions made at the United Nations differ from what is needed on the ground. We need to mainstream the SDGs and their related targets, as well as such universal principles as human rights, in all activities and work of the committees, agencies and related bodies within the United Nations system. Most important, Member States must also adapt to the new realities and challenges facing the Organization. We need to embrace new methods of work that would safeguard such important targets as the successful implementation of the SDGs.\nIndonesia is a true advocate of multilateralism. It is inherent in our DNA, in the founding of our nation and in our Constitution. We are a nation with the world\u2019s fourth-largest population and its largest Muslim population. We are also the world\u2019s third-largest democracy. Ours is a country where democracy, Islam, modernity and the empowerment of women go hand in hand. We are at the forefront of promoting democracy, tolerance, pluralism and peace.\nOur nation is made up of thousands of islands, both large and small, and therefore we fully understand the impacts of climate change. Most important, ours is a nation that respects and fully adheres to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in its foreign relations. Those traits have allowed Indonesia to play a contributing role in various United Nations collective efforts.\nIn the areas of peace and security, Indonesia remains steadfastly committed to increasing its contribution to United Nations peacekeeping, with a target of providing 4,000 personnel by 2019. Our \u201cRoadmap Vision 4,000 Peacekeepers\u201d initiative has motivated us to work unflaggingly to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping operations, while we remain mindful of the fact that contributions to peacekeeping operations are not merely about numbers. Indonesia\u2019s cooperation and efforts in countering terrorism have also been enhanced both regionally and globally.\nWe continue to demonstrate our pioneering role in combating climate change through mitigation and adaptation efforts and in addressing ocean and maritime issues. We signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and are on schedule to conclude the ratification process in due course. Indonesia is also committed to the global efforts to promote and protect human rights. At the regional level, we continue to maintain stability and prosperity through active regional cooperation, as demonstrated by our participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as through knowledge-sharing in our South-South and triangular cooperation.\nAgainst that backdrop, allow me to take this opportunity to announce Indonesia\u2019s candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2019-2020. Indonesia\u2019s practices, commitment and contribution to the United Nations make it a true partner for world peace. Indonesia recognizes that our journey to 2030 may not always be smooth sailing. Addressing the realities of our world today cannot wait for perfect conditions. We must strengthen our commitment to ramping up concrete efforts aimed at creating an environment conducive to widespread progress, thereby ensuring a better tomorrow.\nLasting peace is not merely a goal \u2014 it is the determining factor for meaningful development. Indonesia remains steadfast in its commitment to being at the forefront of global partnerships for world peace and prosperity for all. We will always endeavour to spearhead efforts to work together towards creating a stronger, more representative and democratic United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring warm and fraternal greetings from His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State and iNgwenyama of the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Queen Mother Indlovukati and the entire Swazi nation. His Majesty would have loved to join everyone for this eminent occasion. However, owing to other pressing engagements, he has delegated me to represent him and deliver the national statement of the Kingdom of Eswatini. Our Kingdom is committed to contributing to global issues that affect humankind in the universe.\nAllow me to express our sincere congratulations to the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to commend the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, outgoing Secretary-General, who has performed a sterling job as leader of the Organization for the past 10 years. We also congratulate the United Nations staff for the remarkable work that they do in many parts of the world, in which they promote peace and create a conducive environment for humankind to live in, sometimes under very difficult situations.\nThe theme of this session \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d \u2014 calls upon all of us to contribute to the development of our respective countries and continents. This theme is indeed a cross-cutting subject that covers every aspect of life. We are pleased to inform the General Assembly that the Kingdom has done a lot to mainstream and popularize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through public-awareness campaigns, education and training at all levels. The Kingdom of Eswatini has also integrated the Goals into the national development framework. Furthermore, appropriate institutional arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the implementation of the Goals is properly monitored at all levels.\nBoth the executive and legislative arms of Government are fully involved, and the progress achieved is periodically reported to the Cabinet and Parliament. Our purpose is to achieve all-inclusiveness in the implementation of the SDGs. In that way, we seek to infuse the spirit of ownership into every citizen, so that they understand and appreciate the importance of the SDGs and why they need to participate in the implementation of the Goals, because we do not want to leave anyone behind.\nIt is important to underline that the implementation process is at its infancy stage. Furthermore, as expected, the process is faced with teething challenges owing to limited human, technological and financial resources, to name but a few.\nThe Government has translated the national vision, Vision 2022, into practical and feasible targets to expedite economic growth and focus the country\u2019s efforts on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We have established procedures for tracking progress in the attainment of first-world status. The indicators set cover eight focal areas: economic prosperity, education, health care, service delivery, infrastructure, agricultural and environmental sustainability, governance and corruption.\nIt is against that backdrop that we have revised the national development strategy with a view to emphasizing linkages between the national development agenda, the SDGs and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. For example, education and training are aligned to Sustainable Development Goals 1, 4, and 5. That thematic area is also linked to goals 1, 2, and 18 of Agenda 2063. The country will improve the quality of education by enacting policies that will revolutionize the education system in the Kingdom. The State will direct efforts towards the introduction of science, technology and innovation, as well as the redesign and presentation of technical and vocational training and education in entrepreneurship at the primary-school level so as to inculcate a culture of innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship at a tender age.\nHealth care is one of our top national priorities, which is in line with thematic area 4, which focuses on good health. And that thematic area links directly to goals 1 and 3 of Agenda 2063 and Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 3, and 6. Under that thematic area, the strategies prioritized for the country\u2019s health sector include promoting health throughout one\u2019s life, disease prevention, prompt and efficient management of medical and related conditions, rehabilitation and influencing health-related activities in the relevant primary sectors. The country will specifically strengthen health-care financing and investment and fast-track the establishment of a national health- insurance system to ensure the equity, efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of health services.\nUnder thematic area 5, the country has prioritized the construction of infrastructure, which will ultimately eradicate the hurdles associated with being a landlocked country. To that end, the Government has prioritized road construction and the maintenance of roads and buildings, civil aviation, sustainable energy, research and technology development, safe water supply and sanitation, water-resource development, housing and human settlements, communications, the environment, climate change and disaster management. Those priorities of the Government of Swaziland link to goals 7 and 10 of Agenda 2063 and SDGs 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15.\nFurthermore, the country will increase its rail network from 300 to 429 kilometres, as well as establish a rail-safety regulator, and will further explore the possibility of making rail transportation competitive with road transport.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini will continue with the implementations of such programmes, as they are key to our development agenda.\nWe have also made significant improvements in a variety of sectors, but other challenges are reversing the gains we have made in past years, particularly with the issues of HIV/AIDS and climate change, which are among the plethora of challenges that we face as a developing nation.\nThe Kingdom is committed to addressing the scourge of climate change. The country fully participated in all the negotiations that culminated in the adoption and subsequent signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The negative impact of climate change has become a thorn in the side of the eSwatini economy. It has depleted our limited financial resources, killed an alarming number of our livestock and destroyed most of our ecosystems. The drought has led to a serious reduction in the water\n16-29811 13/52 supply, which is required for crop production, human use and consumption, the sustenance of remaining livestock and for slowing or stopping the disappearance of ecosystems. The drought has exacerbated food and nutrition insecurity for many of our people, not only in the Kingdom but throughout the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and across the entire African continent. A high proportion of our economic activity is agro-based. Therefore, the country has continued to feel the harsh effects of climate change at the levels of subsistence farming and commercial agriculture. It is against that backdrop that the Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini declared the drought a national disaster.\nIntegration has become a universal subject that transcends all aspects of life. It has been proved that any development achieved by individual countries is the result of their citizens having deliberately worked together as a collective entity. That is also true with the United Nations family, where the basis of all our success is togetherness and unity in diversity. We have to come together \u2014 in our different sizes and with our diverse cultures, traditions, economies and political and social inclinations \u2014 to cooperate and become a formidable family ready to address any challenge and achieve any objective we set for ourselves.\nIntegration has succeeded in helping nations work together for common objectives as regions and continents and as the global community. Many countries have succeeded in developing their economies by collectively observing common regional rules in order to promote a regional agenda. Countries have agreed to open their markets in order to facilitate a high degree of economic activity, which, inter alia, boosts trade and creates jobs. Peaceful societies have been created through integration, which is one of the key ingredients that propels the push to transform our world.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini has continued to be an important and active player in promoting regional and continental integration, particularly in the economic sphere. We are a member of several integration arrangements at the regional level in southern and eastern Africa, as well as at the continental level.\nLast month, the Kingdom of eSwatini hosted the thirty-sixth SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government. The theme of the Summit was \u201cResource Mobilization for Investment in Sustainable Energy Infrastructure for an Inclusive SADC Industrialization for the Prosperity of the Region\u201d. That theme is congruous with the theme of the seventy-first session of the General Assembly and is a building-block that augments the push to transform our world at the regional level. The Kingdom of eSwatini has been given the task of leading the SADC for one calendar year, which we accepted with dignity and humility.\nThe SADC Summit theme is in line with all of the Sustainable Development Goals, but most particularly with Goal 7, which is to \u201censure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\u201d, Goal 9, which is to \u201cbuild resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\u201d, and Goal 8, which is to \u201cpromote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all\u201d.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini is also party to a number of trade integration arrangements, including the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Tripartite Free Trade Area, the ongoing negotiations of the Continental Africa Free Trade Area and the Economic Partnership Agreements. Those trade agreements have opened up preferential market access opportunities for our country to maximize its trade at the regional and international levels. Those trade arrangements are also expected to boost the production capacity of countries in the region and add value to primary products, which will lead to industrialization, job creation and, subsequently, poverty reduction. In other words, regional cooperation and integration work to reinforce the implementation of the SDGs and the push to transform our world.\nOne of the key elements to facilitate the successful implementation of the SDGs involves consultation. Since time immemorial, the Kingdom of Swaziland has infused consultation into its way of life. It is a process that is appreciated, accepted and embraced by every member of the general populace at all levels. It is a forum made available to all citizens of the country where they may literally contribute to the way we address all economic, social, political and environmental issues that arise. The Kingdom\u2019s consultation process is unique. Simple and transparent, it accommodates people of all ages, genders, social status, educational backgrounds and political inclinations.\nIt was only last month that the nation convened for days at the Ludzidzini Royal Residence to discuss issues of national significance. We call that gathering the Sibaya, or the People\u2019s Parliament. It is a national consultation process that affords every Swazi citizen an opportunity to contribute to the development of the country. Such an inclusive process serves as a springboard for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and provides a push to transforming our Kingdom, and by extension, our world, in a peaceful manner.\nThe conflict in Syria continues to be a great cause for concern for us all. We call upon all parties involved to immediately find an amicable solution to the impasse. Many lives have been lost, and thousands of Syrians have become refugees in many parts of the world. We therefore urge the United Nations to address the problem in order to create suitable living conditions for the people of Syria. We furthermore urge those entrusted with the responsibility of bringing about peace in Syria not to fight with one another. They should instead concentrate their efforts on restoring peace in the country. They should also speak in one voice and adopt a tone and strategy that gives hope to the Syrians, who desperately need peace.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini would like to emphasize that the push to transform our world will not be effective or adequate if some individuals, communities, countries, regions or continents are left behind. We must never forget that every individual has a part to play in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and, subsequently, in the push to transform our world. That means that there is a need for universal partnerships at all stages and levels throughout the world. That inclusiveness should also be extended to Member State representation in all bodies of the United Nations.\nAccording to the Charter of the United Nations, the Organization\u2019s mission is to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. Accordingly, the 23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan should enjoy the same fundamental rights as any other people. Taiwan is mostly unable to attend the meetings and activities of United Nations specialized agencies. Thus the welfare of its people and, by extension, all humankind, is adversely affected. There is no doubt that their membership will add value to the family\u2019s universal push to transform our world.\nBy the same token, my delegation reiterates and maintains its call for Africa\u2019s voice to be heard loud and clear in the Security Council. This appeal has been on the agenda for the past 15 years and has been specifically articulated in the 2005 Ezulwini Consensus adopted by the African Union Heads of State and Government. My delegation believes that the permanent representation of the African continent in that United Nations organ can contribute tremendously to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and to the universal push to transform our world.\nFinally, once again, we wish the United Nations a prosperous future as it addresses the multiple challenges that we are faced with in many parts of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special pleasure for me, in my capacity of Head of State of the Republic of Albania, to address the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\nAt the outset, I wish to greet, and hail the election of, the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, and to wish him good luck and every success in fulfilling the agenda and the ambitious commitments undertaken.\nAbove and beyond the honour and privilege of addressing the Assembly, I also feel a specific responsibility to provide a modest contribution,\nespecially during this important time of regional and global developments, when our attention has been focused on ensuring sustainable development.\nI would like to express deep appreciation for the substantial vision and role of the Secretary-General and his contribution at the helm of the United Nations by drawing our attention to fundamental issues associated with values and human dignity and to issues related to peace and security on our common planet.\nThis year Albania celebrated the sixty-first anniversary of its membership in the United Nations, and it is with legitimate pleasure that I emphasize that my country remains faithful to the principles of the United Nations Charter and makes a maximal contribution, using all of its potential and capacities, to ensure peace and safety and to improve human rights.\nI take this opportunity to assure the Assembly that my country has the necessary sensitivity to the challenges facing the world today and that it supports all common efforts to address them, with an unwavering conviction that conflict prevention and ensuring global peace and security, with a focus on the attention paid to people and to human society, require close cooperation and coordination.\nIn addressing these challenges, Albania is inclusively and comprehensively engaged in crisis prevention. Its engagement is focused on humanitarian aid; its contribution to regional stability and security; sustainable development; ratification of the Paris Agreement and the depositing of the instruments of ratification with the Secretary-General; the implementation of all of its commitments in the field of security and its appreciated and assessed contribution at the regional and international levels; and playing a proactive role on international platforms for the promotion and advancement of human rights.\nAlbania also views the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an international platform for strengthening the connection between development and security, in the belief that the Agenda will serve as a guide for our action aimed at sustainable development over the next 15 years for peoples, the planet, peace, partnership and prosperity.\nAlbania is a pilot country in designing the global indicators for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 16, for peace, justice and strong and consolidated institutions. I take this opportunity to announce that Albania is determined to be active at the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, which offers a unique opportunity for the adoption of a new urban global agenda to strengthen relationships and synergies among urbanization and sustainable development and climate change.\nThe 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement are rightly considered to be opportunities to create a better life for present and future generations. The implementation of these two international documents, in the context of which Albania is working proactively, is rightly considered a key global strategy for coping with climate change, achieving sustainable development and addressing international assistance and peacemaking and peacebuilding issues.\nAlbania was among those countries that quickly ratified the Paris Agreement, with the sole aim of contributing to the acceleration of its entry into effect and becoming active as soon as possible.\nIn May, I welcomed and attended the first Global Humanitarian Summit, organized and held under the auspices of the Secretary-General in Istanbul. I would note in particular Albania\u2019s support for the Agenda for Humanity and the view that a shift from perpetual crisis management to effective management in the area of prevention and early action is urgently needed. I am convinced that this Agenda will help us to translate the initiative into action for the good of humankind and generations to come.\nAlbania is joining in the international community\u2019s efforts to deal with migration and refugee flows in a consistent and coordinated manner. Today, realities on the ground and at the policy level are leading, even forcing, us to change our approach at the regional level and beyond, in order to take qualitative steps forward in our work, approach and cooperation on migration.\nAlbania, as a European Union candidate country and in anticipation of the opening of accession negotiations, has embraced all of the positions and commitments of the European Union whenever required and necessary. Even within the framework of the Agenda for Humanity, Albania has joined the European Union positions and will contribute with all of its potential and capabilities to meeting those commitments.\nI take this opportunity to compliment once again the Secretary-General on the report published earlier this year entitled \u201cOne humanity: shared responsibility\u201d (A/70/709), as well as to reaffirm the support of my country for the basic principles set out in that report. It offers us a complete picture of the sad reality of human society, the humanitarian situation and human rights around the world.\nAnother fundamental challenge to the common values of human society is the fight against international terrorism and violent extremism. A few days ago, the citizens of New York, the city in which we have gathered today, and all other American citizens felt the pain and grief of commemorating the victims of the terrorist attacks that took place 15 years ago.\nTerrorist attacks, especially those with religious motivations, have intensified in recent years, striking with ferocity and savagery at the major cities of France, Belgium, Turkey, Kuwait, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon and many other countries across the world, aiming to intimidate our societies and bring them to their knees.\nIn this context, Albania appreciates the pivotal role played by the United Nations in the global fight against terrorism and the prevention of violent extremism, as we consider the Organization as a key actor. Albania also supports the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674) and the active role of the United Nations in finding political solutions and addressing the root causes of conflict in areas so affected.\nAlbania reaffirms its support for Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2253 (2015), which require States to take the measures necessary to ensure respect for and the upholding of human rights, as well as address the issue of so-called foreign fighters and the financing of international terrorism. At present, Albania is enlisted in and, like other proactive countries, is committed to fully implementing the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Given our experience of many centuries of peaceful, harmonious religious coexistence, as well as the need to address this challenge domestically, Albania is implementing a pilot programme for preventing and countering terrorism and violent extremism through education, with the ambition of turning that programme into a platform of dimensions wider than a purely domestic one. Albania is ready to share its experience with other countries and peoples.\nGiven the policies that it has pursued over the past two decades, Albania has become increasingly active in contributing to security issues in the international arena. My country has ensured its role and is strengthening that role through its proactive membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, its clear support for and concrete commitment to the implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy mechanisms of the European Union, and its support for and participation in United Nations operations and in the policy advisory assistance missions carried out in Afghanistan and Sudan. Furthermore, Albania has strengthened its role through participating in missions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, improving its strategic partnership with the United States and the European Union and engaging seriously in the fight against terrorism and combating threats to peace and security in the world. Since September 1996, Albania has contributed 6,528 troops to international peacekeeping operations.\nAlbania believes that the peace process in the Middle East can be maintained through negotiations and that the parties involved should take advantage of the energy and attention provided by the international community actors towards a final and lasting solution of this issue.\nAlbania also confirms its support for the efforts of the United Nations to facilitate a peace process in Syria, and it hailed the engagements aimed at establishing peace in Syria, opening and securing the humanitarian aid and assistance routes, and fighting Da\u2019esh and Al-Nusra with determination. But the developments that have unfolded in recent days and hours are\n16-29667 3/58 very worrying. The attacks on and interruption of humanitarian aid convoys to the civilian population undermine the efforts to reach an armistice and put an end to the violence.\nAlbania has recently followed with concern the nuclear tests carried out in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and has condemned them as open, systematic and provocative acts in violation of the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations. Those acts affect peace and security in North- East Asia, as well as worldwide, and Albania therefore demands that that country comply with and enforce international law and the United Nations resolutions.\nAlbania devotes special attention to regional cooperation in its entirety. Our foreign policy is maximally oriented towards the strengthening of good-neighbourly relations with all of the countries of the region and their full-fledged integration into Euro-Atlantic processes. The energetic engagement of Albania in that context and its active and constructive role in all regional initiatives have helped to strengthen political, economic and human development among all partner countries in the region, with the goal of establishing an integration agenda among those countries, the European Union and the Western Balkan countries as part of a common journey of regional countries towards European Union membership.\nAlbania supports Kosovo\u2019s participation in all multilateral, regional and international activities, based on the fundamental principle that all countries in the region should actively participate in and contribute to the process of regional cooperation. Kosovo has made extraordinary achievements in consolidating its democratic institutions, good governance, the multi-ethnic coexistence of religions and, in particular, progress in the Euro-Atlantic processes. The independence of Kosovo has served to strengthen peace, stability and security and has inspired reconciliation in the region. In that spirit, we support and encourage \u2014 with no hesitation \u2014 progress in the ongoing dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which is being mediated and facilitated by the European Union and supported by the United States. We consider those talks to be a very suitable platform for ironing out all of the outstanding issues so that they can set their sights towards the future.\nAlbania will continue to strongly support the expansion of the international recognition of Kosovo and of the active role that it can play as a fully fledged member in all regional organizations, just as we support the inexorable process of its membership in international organizations. That process supports inclusive international policies and Kosovo\u2019s contribution to global policies, and also strengthens peace, security and development in the Balkan region. Today, Kosovo is recognized by 109 United Nations Member States, and I am convinced that soon other Members of the Organization will recognize it, contributing to the further strengthening of peace and stability in the region of South-East Europe and beyond.\nAlbania is fully committed to the process of European integration, and we consider the prospect of European Union membership as an indispensable stimulus for far-reaching reforms in the interest of strengthening the rule of law and achieving sustainable development in my country. The European Union is facing severe challenges, especially after Brexit, but Albania is determined to pursue the path of reforms, considering European integration its major objective and its best \u2014 and only \u2014 alternative.\nIn conclusion, I would like to confirm once again the determination of Albania to continue its support for the United Nations agenda, particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to ensure sustainable development in all countries, We also support efforts to further strengthen and enhance the role of the Organization on the global level.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I have the honour to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the King and the people of Bhutan. I congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support in the discharge of his responsibilities. His distinguished predecessor, Mr. Morgens Lykketoft, deserves our special appreciation for the excellent manner with which he steered the work of the seventieth session.\nWe meet at a time defined by breakthrough agreements. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change stand as testimonies to our collective resolve to advance peace, security, human rights and sustainable development. Those agreements underscore our commitment to multilateralism and serve as a reaffirmation of our faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Together they present a historic opportunity to secure the collective hopes and aspirations of humankind.\nWe have undoubtedly made a good start on that monumental journey. However, let us be clear that many serious global challenges persist. We continue to witness wanton acts of terrorism and protracted conflicts that undermine the security, well-being and human rights of millions of people. Terrorism is the most flagrant violation of human rights, and we strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It afflicts many nations and peoples, and the imperative to redouble international cooperation to combat that scourge is vital and urgent. Over the past five years, at least 15 major conflicts have erupted around the world.\nToday we are witnesses to the largest displacement of people fleeing violence and conflict since the founding of the United Nations. The value of the arms trade and global military expenditures has exceeded Cold-War levels. The current stockpile of nuclear weapons is enough to destroy our planet hundreds of times over. That unimaginable destructive power still looms as a grave threat. All of those facts serve as an acute reminder that our quest for peace and security remains unfulfilled.\nOn the development front, significant gaps and challenges to successfully achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) confront us. For instance, the Secretary General\u2019s June 2016 report to the Economic and Social Council on the SDGs highlights (E/2016/75) that one in eight people suffers from the abject despair of extreme poverty. About 800 million people suffer from hunger. More than 2 billion are affected by water scarcity. And 1.1 billion people live without electricity. Thousands of children die every day, mainly from preventable causes. Children make up nearly half of the almost 900 million people living on less than $1.90 per day. About 124 million children do not attend school, and two out of five leave primary school without basic skills.\nMuch remains to be done to accelerate the rate of progress in achieving gender parity and promoting the rights of women. We need to make concerted efforts to close the economic gap between men and women. Likewise, glaring inequalities within and among nations persist, despite substantial gains in global economic output. And addressing the employment challenge remains a daunting and complex task.\nThe risk of catastrophic climate change is no longer an abstract and long-term threat. Climate change is real, and countries in special situations, such as the least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS), are the most vulnerable. We have all experienced the impact of climate change, which is devastating and destabilizing, as can be seen from the frequency and intensity of recent weather events. In July we in Bhutan suffered extensive destruction and damage to property and infrastructure caused by unprecedented flash floods. Even as we deal with those long-standing challenges, the digital revolution, while opening new frontiers of opportunity by spurring global integration and catalysing a fourth industrial revolution, is ushering in new and interlocking challenges that have social, political, economic and security implications that we have yet to fully comprehend.\nWe have to move past the euphoria of landmark agreements. Now more than ever before, we must find new political resolve for urgent, focused and comprehensive action that involves all stakeholders at the national, regional and international levels \u2014 action that translates agreements into real and meaningful dividends for all peoples and all countries.\nThe scale, scope and complexity involved in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda should not be underestimated, especially given the time frame of fewer than 15 years. The focus now and in the years ahead must be on implementation. The principles and objectives of the 2030 Agenda are consistent with Bhutan\u2019s national development framework based our concept of Gross National Happiness. Guided by that timeless vision propounded by our kings, we have always ensured that peace, happiness and the well- being of our people remained at the core of all our endeavours. Formerly a closed subsistence economy with no electricity or roads, Bhutan today is a rapidly emerging economy that aspires to achieve holistic development. With the accelerated development of our hydropower sector, the next 15 years are expected to usher in even greater transformation.\nBhutan has successfully aligned the SDGs with our national priorities and integrated them into our development-planning framework. The next decade will be critical as we seek to consolidate development gains and work towards realizing our national development goals of eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive and sustained economic growth, achieving self-reliance and eventually graduating from the least-developed- country category. We will continue to work in earnest to ensure the effective implementation of the SDGs, so that we succeed in achieving the transformation that we all seek. That is particularly important, as Bhutan faces immense challenges as an LDC and as a landlocked country. In that endeavour, the role of our development partners is critical.\nThe effectiveness of national strategies and investment plans, in both the formulation and the implementation, depends on predictable commitments of financial, technical and policy support measures from development partners. Our partners\u2019 emphasis needs to shift from the expression of approximate broad support measures for the benefit of LDCs as a group to what is necessary at the country level. Financing for development, particularly commitments to official development assistance, must be disaggregated at the country level, so that they can be expressed in national budgets aimed at financing short-, medium- and long- term investment plans. Without such predictability, it is impossible for LDCs to formulate the integrated and effective strategies and plans needed to achieve the SDGs. In that regard, allow me to share some of our experiences, so as to illustrate how the predictability of financing allows for more ambitious plans.\nIn 1992, we established the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation \u2014 the world\u2019s first environmental trust fund \u2014 to protect our pristine environment and rich biodiversity through the implementation of conservation programmes. Similarly, in 1998, we established the Health Trust Fund, which today sustainably finances the essential drug needs that are fundamental to our free health-care system. Recently, in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund, we launched the Bhutan for Life Project, an innovative financing initiative based on a project-financing-for-permanence model. Funds generated through the project will be used to maintain and manage Bhutan\u2019s protected areas, parks and biological corridors in perpetuity, as well as to promote sustainable livelihoods for the communities in the area. We hope to expand that innovative financing model with development partners to cover other critical sectors such as sustainable energy, education and infrastructure development.\nThe success of the 2030 Agenda will ultimately hinge on the quality of partnerships involving Governments, the private sector and civil society at the national, regional and global levels. Partnerships in innovative financing for development will be vital for groups of countries in special situations, namely, the LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. We look forward to the continued support of our development partners and well-wishers.\nBhutan\u2019s commitment and contributions to the conservation and preservation of the environment, the protection of biodiversity and the mitigation of climate change have been widely acknowledged. That commitment dates back more than two decades, when we took a deliberate decision to shift our forest policy away from revenue generation towards environmental protection by banning the export of raw timber, despite our limited resources. Furthermore, in 2008, we pledged to safeguard our forests through a constitutional mandate that requires maintaining a minimum of 60 per cent of our land under forest cover in perpetuity. Today, 75 per cent of our land is covered in forest, and 38 per cent of our total land area has been designated as national protected areas. In 2009, we committed to remaining carbon neutral, but in reality we are carbon negative, and we look forward to ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change upon completion of internal processes.\nEffective multilateralism requires an effective United Nations \u2014 one that is fit for the purpose. Since the founding of the United Nations, the world has undergone profound changes. Its membership has increased fourfold, and the challenges we face have become more complex. Institutions cannot be static. They must evolve and adapt, so as to remain relevant and effective. The United Nations and its principal organs must be reformed in keeping with contemporary realities \u2014 in particular the Security Council, so as to make the Council more representative, transparent and accountable and to enhance its legitimacy and credibility. Similarly, the 2030 Agenda requires a United Nations development system that is able to deliver integrated and coordinated policy support. In that regard, it is essential to achieve an ambitious outcome to the new quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system \u2014 one that matches the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda.\nBhutan has been blessed with peace, progress and stability under the enlightened leadership of our monarchs. We embraced democracy in a unique manner, as it was imposed on us by our kings and not born out of popular unrest or strife. I am pleased to state that our transition to democracy is on a firm footing, with democratic institutions in place, supported by a vibrant and independent media.\nPeace and security is a shared concern and responsibility. Bhutan is committed to supporting United Nations peacekeeping endeavours to maintain peace, protect civilians and create the conditions necessary for lasting and durable solutions to conflicts around the world. Despite our limitations and constraints, we joined the fraternity of troop- and police-contributing countries in 2014. That is a reflection of our commitment to share the burden along with other Member States. Today, we have a presence in 10 peacekeeping missions, and we hope to broaden and deepen our peacekeeping engagement in the coming years.\nAs Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon completes his tenure in December, I wish to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude and appreciation to him for his leadership, service and contributions to the important work of the United Nations. We wish him and his family every success in all their future endeavours.\nSecond chances are rare in life. The agreements that we adopted in 2015 have given us an extraordinary opportunity to bring about greater peace, progress and prosperity for all. History will judge us by our ability to translate those compacts into meaningful and concrete results. Let us not squander this historic opportunity.\nAddressing our peace, security and sustainable development challenges requires global action, underpinned by the solidarity of all Member States and bound together by a strong esprit de corps at the United Nations. In that context, I would like to end with a quote by His Majesty the King of Bhutan:\n\u201cIndividual or even national success is a ship that cannot carry everyone together to the same place at the same time. Rich nations must stop and be mindful of the poorer ones left behind. Successful people must stop and remember those who did not make it. No nation today can stand alone in achievement. Time is slowly telling us that there can be no lasting individual success without success as a community, and there cannot be lasting national progress and success if it does not fit into a future of global peace, harmony and equality. The world must progress together or fail together.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, at the outset, to express to you, President Thomson, and through you to your country, our congratulations on the trust placed in you to guide the work of this session. We have great hopes that this session will help us embed the principles underpinning the Organization and the General Assembly. We very much hope that this occasion will also be an opportunity to promote international collaboration. I would also like to express to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon my most sincere thanks and appreciation for all of his great efforts for the good of peoples around the world, as well as his promotion of the noble principles of the United Nations.\nThis session is taking place at the same time as the celebration of independence of the State of Tunisia \u2014 60 years of independence as a modern country. It is 60 years since we joined the United Nations, and this is an opportunity for us to reiterate how much Tunisia is committed to the purposes and principles behind the creation of the Organization. We are fully prepared to pursue assistance to the Organization so that the United Nations can accomplish its noble goal of promoting peace, security, human rights and development throughout the world.\nTunisia has had the unique experience of building democracy based on national accord so that we can overcome differences in political opinion. That has allowed us to see major political accomplishments. We have a new, modern Constitution. We have held legislative and presidential elections that were witnessed by the entire world and declared transparent, free and fair. That has increased our confidence in ourselves and has made us more able to face up to the challenges we face. It also led to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015, which in turn enabled us to rectify our political trajectory to overcome a political impasse.\nOur democratic experience in Tunisia has had major achievements, but we still need support. Given our fragile economy, we still need to strengthen our democracy. Five years have already gone by since the 2011 Tunisian revolution, but we are still facing enormous challenges on the path towards achieving an economic revival and improving living standards.\nWe have launched an ambitious initiative to meet the expectations of the Tunisian people. We called for the establishment of a Government of national unity that would be capable of satisfying our needs at this stage in our history: winning the fight against terrorism, accelerating coordination between development and growth, stimulating job creation, fighting corruption and laying the foundations for good governance and for the implementation of effective social policies.\nThis initiative has enjoyed broad support from political parties and different national organizations. It led to the establishment of a Government of national unity, with robust participation by women, headed by a young leader. This reflects our determination to allow young people and women to assume important roles in this democratic experience. Tunisia left authoritarianism behind in 2011, and our country is now under the rule of law. We reiterate our determination to move forward toward further democracy and freedom and to face up to all attempts to take us back in time.\nOf course, we are still a young country. We are facing major economic and social challenges of an unprecented scale that jeopardize our path to the future, especially given the regional context, particularly regional terrorism. That requires us to seek robust support from our partners so that we can overcome the challenges and osbtacles and make headway on internal development and create jobs for young people, particularly those with qualifications.\nOn 29 and 30 November, Tunisia will host an international conference to support the economy and seek investment. Participants will include Heads of State and Government, representatives of international organizations, investment funds, civil society representatives and representatives from the public and private sectors. It will be an opportunity for our brothers and friends to express their support and solidarity with Tunisia, including their support for democracy in our country at this particularly critical point in time.\nThis year\u2019s general debate is of particular importance, especially following the adoption of the new Sustainable Development Goals. It is of particular importance because it is linked to the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Tunisia also adopted ambitious goals in establishing our own development plan. We will spare no effort to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.\nWe call upon all partners to redouble their efforts to assist developing countries as they seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including by providing them with the support they are counting on \u2014 especially for African countries, which are encountering many economic, social and environmental difficulties. Those challenges require robust assistance from the international community so that African communities and countries can achieve development. We need to make certain that we can do that in order to ensure that we have peace, stability and security and so that we can prevent conflicts and confront terrorism and extremism.\nToday, we renew our commitment to the African Union Agenda 2063, which is the sum of our ambitions and our dedication. Given the close link between peace, security and development, we also renew our commitment to strengthening our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations and to taking a more active role in capacity-building within the African continent, including on military assistance.\nThe Arab world is seeing an increase in violence and conflict, which is a major source of concern. Violence, extremism and terrorism are spreading. We have seen that lead to an increase in organized criminal activity, which is destabilizing every one of our countries without exception. The lack of stability in the Arab world is just a part of the instability found throughout the world. Therefore, we call upon everyone to find urgent political solutions to all the issues concerning the region. First and foremost is the Palestinian question, which requires a fair, comprehensive solution that will provide justice for the Palestinian people, bring an end to their suffering and allow them to obtain their historic legitimate rights, in particular the establishment of an independent State, with Al-Quds as its capital, in conformity with related international decisions.\nWe are greatly concerned by the crisis in Libya, and our concerns will remain while instability reigns in that brotherly country, with all the implications that it can have for our security and our economy. We are firmly committed to promoting reconciliation and agreement between the different parties in Libya so that they can implement all phases of the Libyan Political Agreement, signed in 17 December 2015, under the auspices of the United Nations. We shall also continue our support for the Government of National Accord so that it can assume its responsibilities and accomplish its role in re-establishing peace, stability and security and in combating terrorism and improving the living standards of the Libyan people.\nWe are following with concern the evolution of the situations in Syria and Yemen. We are concerned about the implications for security and the humanitarian disaster resulting from those conflicts. We need a political solution to the situations in those two countries so that they can maintain their unity and territorial integrity in order to ensure peace.\nI stand here before the Assembly as we commemorate our independence and the sixtieth anniversary of our accession to the Organization. That reminds me of the founder of modern Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, who in a speech confirmed that Tunisia, having recovered its independence, declared its complete commitment to the purposes and principles and the noble humanitarian values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Today, as we begin a new chapter in our history \u2014 our ancient history \u2014 with many efforts to advance democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights, we again affirm our determination to create a conducive environment for our citizens to be able to live in dignity. As Tunisia grounds itself on the efforts of the Tunisian people, with the support of our brothers and partners, we firmly believe that those efforts will be successful in contributing to security and peace in the region and worldwide.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to be in this Hall for the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. It is wonderful to see one of my Pacific Island brothers at the helm of this body. Let me assure him of the full support of my delegation as he leads the important work of the Assembly. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, our outgoing President, for his exceptional work.\nI would like to say to the incoming President that his position comes with enormous responsibility, and the upcoming session will be more important than most. Every time we turn on the television, we are treated to images of turmoil. From violent extremism to political upheaval, to large-scale migration and a climate in chaos, the world is at a crossroads and the General Assembly will decide its path.\nFortunately, the 193 Members of the United Nations have given us some detailed road maps to guide our work: the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Those universal agreements capture the collective will of the international community. Such agreements point the way towards greater cooperation, and Nauru is deeply committed to their full implementation.\nThe commitments that we have made to each other represent our best efforts to meet the challenges before us, and we made those commitments knowing that some of us need help to fulfil them. We agreed that no country should be left behind. Now begins the most important work: translating our words into concrete action. Our primary task is to direct resources to where they will matter most.\nWe should not underestimate the difficulty of such a task. Some international funding mechanisms exclude small countries like mine, or prove impossible to access because of the limited capacity of small countries. Private investment is unreliable and rarely available to support basic services and critical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the most promising financing models for small developing countries \u2014 direct access and direct budgetary support, for example \u2014 are rarely available as an option. That needs to change, so that small countries can fully benefit from the historic agreements we have reached. Nauru is asking a lot from its development partners. We want to be better partners ourselves. Our efforts must, therefore, go beyond capacity-building to focus on institution-building. Those efforts must be backed by real resources and include the long-term, in-country engagement of international and regional agencies. The goal must be nothing short of building durable domestic institutions that are run by a skilled national workforce. On that note, let me thank our partners Australia, Taiwan, Japan, the Russian Federation, Cuba, New Zealand and others for their support to our sustainable development priorities.\nThe implementation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 \u2014 the sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources \u2014 is a high priority. The ocean is a pillar of our small island economy, our environment and our culture. Stresses on marine biodiversity are mounting, including those that go beyond national jurisdiction. The gaps in our governance of the oceans must therefore be addressed. We urge a timely and comprehensive conclusion of the Preparatory Committee process on developing an international instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The upcoming United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of SDG 14 presents a welcome and much-needed opportunity to foster a shared vision for a healthy, productive and resilient ocean to guide all our ocean-related activities.\nLet me also highlight the importance of the long- term conservation and sustainable use of our fisheries. The parties to the Nauru Agreement are on the cutting edge of sustainable fisheries management. However, the international community must ensure that a disproportionate burden of conservation measures does not fall on the small island developing States (SIDS). The burden and costs of those measures must be shared equitably.\nThe full implementation of our international commitments takes on much greater urgency in the face of climate change. That is why Nauru was among the first countries in the world to ratify the Paris Agreement. It is encouraging to hear that we are on track for the Agreement\u2019s entry into force this year. However, it is far too early to celebrate. The Paris Agreement is not the end of our climate work. It is only the beginning.\nGreenhouse gas emissions over the past 150 year have pushed the climate system beyond the boundaries of human experience. Brewing superstorms and droughts can be as destructive as any bomb. Sea-level rise can occupy our territory just as surely as an invading army. From the perspective of my small island nation in the Pacific, climate change is our greatest humanitarian crisis. It is our war, and while Nauru will be among the first to experience the worst impacts, climate change will be the rest of the world\u2019s humanitarian challenge as well.\nThe Paris Agreement notwithstanding, the dangerous climate impacts will continue to grow worse over the coming decades. We have little understanding of how our human systems will hold up under climate stress. Global supply chains, finance and insurance markets, food and water distribution \u2014 those systems are complex and interlinked and form the foundation of our modern civilization. Climate change raises some hard questions, and I am not sure we have the answers. Can we feed a planet of 9 billion people when crop yields are projected to fall? Will we learn to share declining freshwater resources as the glaciers disappear? Will we be able to protect the millions who are rendered homeless when low-lying coastal areas are inundated? And can these and many other challenges be managed effectively so that we avoid a proliferation of failed States?\nWe are simply not prepared. For that reason, Nauru calls on Members to support the proposal by the Pacific SIDS to appoint a United Nations special representative on climate and security. The security implications of climate change will define the twenty-first century, and we must prepare.\nRegarding the Security Council, Nauru supports expanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members in the Council. It is time to reflect the geopolitical realities of today, not those of 70 years ago. The persistence of the current arrangement continues to cast a shadow of illegitimacy over everything we do at the United Nations. If we are to nurture the spirit of cooperation represented by the historic agreements of 2015, then we must reform the most powerful organ of the United Nations. And we support the inclusion of India, Japan, Germany, Brazil and others in the permanent category.\nNauru welcomes the restored diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. However, we call upon the United States to completely lift its economic embargo immediately.\nNauru is deeply concerned about the situation in West Papua, including the alleged human rights abuses there. As emphasized in the Pacific Islands Forum communiqu\u00e9, it is important that an open and constructive dialogue take place with Indonesia on that matter.\nNauru is also concerned by the mounting tensions provoked by the recent action of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The Pacific region saw far too much violence and suffering during the previous century. We must not allow the scourge of war to return. Nuclear proliferation has no place in a sustainable world.\nI would like to address the situation of Nauru\u2019s close friend, Taiwan. According to the Charter of the United Nations, our mission here is\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\u201d.\nThe 23 million people of the Republic of China should therefore enjoy those same fundamental rights. Taiwan has contributed to the World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The people are promoting the Sustainable Development Goals domestically and internationally, and they are helping to lead the way towards a low-carbon economy. Taiwan is a key stakeholder in the international community. We should make efforts to regularize their participation throughout the United Nations system, so that we can all benefit from their substantial contributions.\nLastly, I would like to extend my country\u2019s deep appreciation for the work of the current Secretary- General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. He has been a true friend of small islands. We are thankful for his leadership on many of the issues that we hold most dear. His most enduring legacy may perhaps be to have raised climate change to the top of the international agenda, but his tireless efforts to ensure that no country, no matter how small, is left behind is just as important. He was the first sitting Secretary-General to make an official visit to Pacific small island developing States, and he has an open invitation to visit Nauru.\nIn conclusion, I want to say that the United Nations is at a crossroads. While the Charter of the United Nations is rooted in the equality of nations, we do not always live up to that principle. There are still times when only some of us hold the pen, some sit at the table and some are locked out behind a closed door. A small group of countries has the real power to give us the necessary push to transform our world. They can make sure that resources are directed to where they matter. We need those countries to carry forward the goals and objectives that we have spent so many years negotiating, even in those exclusive rooms when the rest of us are not present.\nThe power of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development stems from its legitimacy. It was the product of a truly open and transparent process that reflected the hopes and aspirations of all 193 States Members of the United Nations. We all sat at the table and held the pen together. I implore our partners to remember that. Now, we are entrusting the President of the General Assembly with taking that work forward and holding us accountable for our commitments. From one Pacific Islander to another, he has our complete confidence.\nMay God bless the Republic of Nauru. May God bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "This year\u2019s session of the General Assembly comes at a critical time. Over the past few years we have witnessed grave violations of the very principles on which the United Nations is based \u2014 violations that have caused widespread human suffering and insecurity. Syria, Yemen, Ukraine and South Sudan are some examples, but the list goes on. Yet at the same time, the world has moved forward, countries have come together, found compromises and taken joint action, as, for example, when we reached the Paris Agreement and adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2014 the road map for our future coexistence and cooperation.\nTherefore, where do we go from here? We cannot let fear guide our actions. We cannot return to a world of zero-sum games, narrow national interests and protectionism. We cannot move away from a rules-based system that guards against confrontation and unpredictability. We \u2014 the international community \u2014 must rally around the multilateral system with renewed strength. Let me assure the Assembly that Norway will work hard to promote respect for international law and to find common solutions.\nMy own continent, Europe, has enjoyed a unique era of peace, democracy and trade. Now, however, we are facing a complex security situation. Unfortunately, some States have chosen not to abide by international law and are simply pursuing national interests at the expense of others. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa is causing widespread human suffering and leading to violent extremism in Europe. The response should not be to isolate ourselves; instead, we must cooperate and find solutions.\nThe humanitarian situation in Syria simply cannot be tolerated. Global and regional Powers must take action to secure an enduring ceasefire and ensure humanitarian access \u2014 right now. The world expects the Security Council and the International Syria Support Group to deliver. And it is not just Syria that we need to focus on. Conflict and suffering continue elsewhere, and more needs to be done to find common solutions to common challenges. In that context, let me send a message to President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who are speaking before and after me today. I strongly urge the parties to address the imminent threats to the two-State solution by implementing the recommendations in the Quartet report.\nWe must intensify our efforts to tackle the humanitarian consequences of today\u2019s crises. Norway will continue to provide record levels of humanitarian assistance \u2014 to Syria, to South Sudan and elsewhere. Together we need to intensify our efforts to promote peace and stability in a wide range of fragile and conflict-affected States. We need to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to help countries emerging from conflict. We have a clear responsibility to fight terrorism and step up our efforts to prevent violent extremism. In order to do so, we need to work closely with civil society, women, young people, faith leaders and local communities.\nWe need to translate the women and peace and security agenda into more effective action on the ground. We need to ensure that peace operations deliver on their mandates to protect civilians. Sexual exploitation and abuse must stop. We need zero tolerance and resolute action by the United Nations. United Nations peacekeepers, development workers and humanitarian workers from a large number of countries are making a real difference in numerous countries, including Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They must be equipped with the tools and resources they need. I would like to assure the Assembly that Norway will continue to provide substantial humanitarian and development assistance and support the reform of United Nations peace operations.\nHowever, we cannot prevent or resolve conflicts by addressing the consequences alone. We must also address the underlying causes. Thankfully, in some places, our efforts are producing tangible results. After more than five decades of conflict, peace is now within reach in Colombia. I am proud that, together with Cuba, Norway facilitated the peace process. It will be a great and historic step forward for the region, and Norway will continue to provide diplomatic and practical support to the Colombian peace process in its crucial implementation phase.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are ground-breaking. They provide us with a road map for the future we want, and we have agreed to leave no one behind. That means that we must address inequality and social injustice and safeguard the rule of law. It also means that we must empower women and men alike. We must strengthen the human rights pillar of the United Nations, both financially and politically. That should be seen as an important investment in the future. I would like to highlight the role played by those who promote the rights of others \u2014 of women, minorities and members of marginalized communities. Human rights defenders are an important corrective in any society, and only weak leaders fear correction.\nThe SDGs are all about building inclusive societies. Inclusive societies perform better. The right to education and health is crucial in that regard. Today there are 263 million children and young people who are not in school, and the number is growing. Last year, together with the Presidents of Chile, Indonesia and Malawi and the Director-General of UNESCO, I initiated the establishment of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. On Sunday, the Commission submitted a report entitled \u201cThe Learning Generation\u201d with recommendations to the Secretary-General. The Commission makes a strong case for why it is so vital to ensure that the world invests in education as a key driver of economic growth. I could not agree more. We must avoid a global learning crisis, and the consequences of inaction will be severe. Together, we must invest more to ensure that no one is left behind. Each and every one of us should have the same learning opportunities, and the education of girls is especially important. When girls go to school and get an education, it not only represents the exercise of a fundamental right, it is also good for the economy. Global education will continue to be a top priority of Norway\u2019s development policy.\nAnother priority for Norway is strengthening epidemic preparedness and global health security by developing new vaccines that can prevent new outbreaks. That important goal requires effective partnerships across national borders and across every sector of society, along with the mobilization of both domestic and private-sector resources. Antibiotic medicines have saved millions of lives, but antimicrobial resistance is making them increasingly ineffective. If we do not act, we could reach a stage where common infections are once again deadly. Our grandchildren could die from illnesses that our grandparents survived. New global health challenges require increased international cooperation. I am therefore pleased that we managed to put the issue high on the agenda this week. We know what needs to be done, and now it is time do the work back home.\nThe Climate Conference in Paris late last year marked a turning point in the fight to save our planet. We now need effective and concerted action in order to bring down emissions and meet the ambitious objectives that we have set ourselves. Our ambition is to do all of that while still providing decent work and economic growth for all. That will require investment in innovation, and we have no time to lose.\nIn the decades ahead, the oceans will play a bigger role in the global economy. Today, 17 per cent of all of the animal protein consumed globally comes from the sea. In order to meet growing demands, the share of our food that we obtain from the oceans will have to increase substantially. Since growth from capture fisheries is limited, we need more sustainable aquaculture. As world trade continues to grow, the need for marine transport will increase. The oceans are also already a major source of energy. That resource must be developed further, so as to meet the growing demand for clean and renewable energy. In short, the oceans hold great promise for the future. We have seen only the very beginning of the blue economy. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea strikes a delicate balance between competing interests and needs, enabling us to realize the potential of marine resources, protect marine biodiversity and prevent conflicts in the maritime domain.\nThe adoption of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement shows what can be achieved when countries come together to find compromises and take action. In our globalized and interdependent world, effective international cooperation is essential if we are to address poverty, conflicts, climate change, migration and terrorism. No Government can single-handedly deliver effective solutions to the challenges we face. This morning, Norway, together with Colombia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan and Mexico, presented five recommendations intended for the new Secretary-General, aimed at promoting an independent and credible United Nations that can play a uniting and leading role. The United Nations has a unique place in the multilateral world order. It is our shared responsibility to defend a world order in which solutions are found through negotiation and respect for international law. The validity of the United Nations mandate remains strong, but the Organization will also have to reform itself if it is to address the challenges ahead.\nI would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his hard work and success in a range of areas, including the adoption of the SDGs. The next Secretary-General must continue to defend and promote the multilateral world order and lead the process of change that will be needed in order to ensure global stability and sustainable development for all. Norway will support him or her in that endeavour.\n"

        "file_text": "I address the General Assembly today for my tenth and last time. The first time I spoke here (see A/62/PV.5), I addressed climate change, conflict, refugees and \u2014 what was apparently a first at the General Assembly \u2014 cyberattacks as the continuation of policy by other means.\nThe issues are therefore largely the same, and only the urgency that we sense has been ratcheted up. Certainly, the world was more stable then. It was before the economic and migration crises, the current conflicts in the wider Middle East, or Russia\u2019s aggression against Georgia and Ukraine. It was also before the war on truth and facts that seems to have taken over in many places. Despite our concerns at the time, we lived in a more stable world, where optimism had not yet become naivet\u00e9. Today, in too many parts of the world, we find a conflict either emerging, raging or frozen. Terrorism, always a scourge, dominates our daily headlines in all parts of the world.\nNot all of today\u2019s conflicts and crises could have been prevented, yet the effect of many could have been mitigated had we acted sooner or had the proper mechanisms to resolve them been in place. When I addressed the Assembly in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in 2008 (see A/63/PV.8), I warned not to apply international law selectively. International law had clearly been violated, yet little was done. Six years later, in 2014, we saw a repeat performance in Ukraine. Part of a sovereign State was annexed and another part turned into a war zone. For the first time since the Second World War, borders in Europe had been changed through the use of force. The prohibition on the use of force to change borders lies at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations. It was blatantly violated, and yet the United Nations could not make a difference. Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine continues. The territories of Ukraine and Georgia remain occupied by a foreign military force, and frozen conflicts persist in Nagorno Karabakh and Transnistria.\nWe need global norms. Just as we need international law, we also need the mechanisms to enforce it. Unless the United Nations starts to do more, it will, over time, lose relevance. When we face a global challenge, the United Nations should be the first place to come to for a solution, not the last stop when all other options have been exhausted, knowing that nothing will happen anyway.\nDuring the past 15 years, the number of migrants and refugees worldwide has grown faster than the world\u2019s population. I raise the issue not only because it is a crisis, but also because I myself am a child of refugees. What we face is not \u2014 I stress \u2014 an unprecedented crisis, as so many have averred. We have faced far worse refugee crises and we have prevailed. In the Europe of 1946, Germany alone had 12 million internal refugees and another 12 million displaced persons of 20 different nationalities. Other countries in the post- war shambles and ruin of Europe at the time were not in much better shape. Yet we prevailed, or rather our grandparents did. In three years, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration \u2014 and I stress the first two words of the name of this agency \u2014 spent in today\u2019s money approximately \u20ac50 billion to resolve that crisis. It took political will, courage and far more money to solve that crisis than we are willing to spend today.\nMigration is our common challenge. A sustainable solution to this complex problem lies in addressing its causes. Yet we also must fulfil our commitments under international conventions on the protection of refugees. Such commitments already exist. They are not some vague future goal to which we pledge.\nMigrant children are at the heart of migration influx. Children on the move or otherwise affected by migration are the most vulnerable group, who, lacking agency, face limited access to justice and social and health services and therefore often suffer horrible abuse. One significant challenge is to provide education to the children in refugee camps. Depriving them of education will damage the prospects of refugee and asylum-seeking children, leave them behind and, at the same time, increase the risk of the kind of alienation that often leads later to extremism. We have seen this where refugee camps have been in place for a long time \u2014 sometimes for generations \u2014 begetting a continuing crop of disaffected, alienated and radicalized youth who feel that they have nothing to lose.\nThe ongoing conflicts we see around the world will, if we do not take control, breed a terrorism that knows no bounds. Estonia reaffirms its commitment to working together to prevent and counter terrorism, which is why we participate in the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\nEstonia firmly supports the International Criminal Court and its quest to end impunity. Countries, whether or not they have joined the Rome Statute, must set an example of non-aggression, self-restraint and respect for the rule of law. We believe that a commitment to fighting impunity at all levels is the only way to deter those who might commit crimes in future.\nIn 2005, the States Members of the United Nations committed to the principle of responsibility to protect, better known as R2P, and to fight genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. However, the brutality we see in Syria shows that an effective solution lies beyond the grasp of the United Nations. When a Government fails to live up to its commitments, when it violates the fundamental norms of civilized behaviour \u2014 let alone the tenets of the United Nations \u2014 the international community must act. In this respect, the Security Council bears primary responsibility. Council members that veto or vote against actions aimed at preventing mass atrocities carry co-responsibility for those atrocities.\nA primary criticism directed at the United Nations today is the Security Council\u2019s inability or unwillingness to respond to major crises. Estonia cannot speak from first-hand experience, as we have not yet served in the Council; we have merely observed. We want, however, to bring the spirit of openness, transparency and inclusiveness to the Council\u2019s work, and hence are running for a non-permanent seat for 2020-2021. We are convinced that the role of the General Assembly and the non-permanent members of the Council must be increased.\nThe majority of States Members of the United Nations are small countries. As we look at the history of conflict since the Second World War, small countries are almost invariably the victims of conflict, not the abetters. This is nothing new. In the Melian Dialogue at the heart of his History of the Peloponnesian Wars, Thucydides famously concluded that \u201cthe strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must\u201d. That is why we have international law \u2014 to protect the weak and the small. Their voices must be better heard and their rights must be upheld. Estonia, as a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group, is working together with a number of other countries to improve the working methods of the Security Council so as to bring about badly needed changes.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are effective tools for advancing security and stability, spurring economic growth, eradicating poverty, preserving the environment and promoting human development. Taking that commitment seriously, Estonia was among the first countries to present our voluntary national review on the implementation of SDGs during the High-level Political Forum.\nEstonia attaches great importance to the Goal of achieving gender equality that can unlock the economic potential of women. More equal societies work better for everyone. Achieving gender equality is first and foremost the duty of political leaders and the Governments that they lead. Amid current conflicts, it is important to ensure that women do not fall victim to gender-based violence. It is also important that they be included in conflict resolution and peace negotiations. It is therefore imperative to continue to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions on women and peace and security.\nFree media is an integral, even inseparable, part of modern and democratic society, where Governments listen to criticism, which, after all, forms part of what we call the voice of the people. Yet all around the globe, we see that critical voices \u2014 and even those that merely report the facts \u2014 face reprisals, jail and violence. The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity must be implemented if we are to change the absurdity that reporting facts is a life-threatening activity.\nFor Estonia, a leader of innovation in the digital world, the right to freedom of opinion and expression online and offline is a fundamental issue. Digital technology has been a liberating force, yet some would turn it into a means to control citizens. As a founder of the Freedom Online Coalition, Estonia is a donor to the Digital Defenders Partnership, contributing to the protection of the rights of journalists, bloggers and human-rights defenders online. In times of rapid developments in information and communications technology, the protection of human rights and the rule of law must keep pace.\nThe right to freedom of expression also means keeping the Internet free and unrestricted. In other words, digital freedom of expression in no way differs from freedom of expression in the analog world. Censorship, illicit filtering and the online blocking of opposition voices thwarts democracy no less than when the printed word is censored.\nAn open Internet is an amplifier of economic growth and thus a crucial element of sustainable development in the twenty-first century. That is an essential conclusion, incidentally, of the World Bank\u2019s World Development Report 2016, entitled \u201cDigital Dividends\u201d, whose preparation I co-chaired. Information technology can lead to transparent governance and economic growth but only if it is open and unfettered.\nThe challenges we face in the coming years are enormous. Estonia firmly believes in a rules-based international order. The only international organization global enough to achieve that end is the United Nations.\nFinally, let me say that the 10 times I have appeared here over the past decade have been genuinely rewarding experiences, and I trust that my successor will continue to believe in the work that the Assembly does. I would like to thank the members for their attention and for all that they have given me.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Madagascar that I lead, I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and wish him every success in presiding over the work of the General Assembly during the current session. At the same time, we would like to convey our heartfelt appreciation to his predecessor.\nBy submitting, together with 21 other countries, a voluntary national review report in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Madagascar reaffirms and solidifies the political commitment it undertook when it signed on to the global mobilization last year which led to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Those objectives, which we all wanted to be universal, do not apply only to developing or poor countries, but rather to all countries, adjusted to local realities and development differentials, because a sustainable world can be built only upon an ecology-friendly transition in the North and responsible development in the South.\nThe hopes sparked by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are immense. Nevertheless, we must move from commitments to action and implementation. The major challenges are the redistribution of investments, improving social justice and translating international commitments into national strategies and political action. Human development, environmental protection and inclusive economies are the triptych that structures the SDGs. They align with our national development plan. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, Madagascar is promoting social protection. This year, we formulated and implemented a national policy in that regard. By way of example, we provide income supplements for the poorest households to support the integration of children into the school system and to improve their nutrition through school cafeterias.\nIn addition to the social protection I just mentioned, health and education are sectors that we hold dear. Health is key for our country, as it is the best way to ensure the productivity of our people, both at school and in the workplace. That is why the draft universal health- coverage system was set up this year as part of our efforts to improve our public-health system. This policy will provide heath-care solutions for our people, especially the most vulnerable. Furthermore, the Government has committed itself to increasing vaccination coverage in Madagascar through a vaccination law. Other health- related efforts have been made with the United Nations in recent years, particularly in the fight against HIV/ AIDS. In the education sector, we have been able to begin recruiting and training tens of thousands of teachers in an attempt to raise the school attendance rate, to help school dropouts go back to school and to improve the quality of our teaching.\nOur young people, women and girls are the cornerstone of all of our public policies and development initiatives. Economic and social development, and, in particular, conditions for making the world more stable will be in vain if priority is not given to young people. From this rostrum, I call on all countries to collectively resolve to assist one another, in order to support development policies for young people. We need to create jobs for them, develop their talents and meet their legitimate aspirations to contribute to world peace and curb migration.\nProtecting and empowering women and young girls, ensuring their equal rights and gender parity in development participation and respecting the rights of children and young people are at the heart of our concerns and our thinking. We will continue to reform our national plans and policies in order to promote equal access for women and men to economic resources and basic services. One notable achievement in Malagasy women\u2019s rights was the reform of the nationality code to allow children born to a Malagasy mother and a foreign father to acquire Malagasy citizenship through the maternal line, irrespective of the father\u2019s nationality. Similarly, in the interest of being all inclusive, the ratification of the international Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has allowed us to improve the protection offered to people with disabilities in Madagascar by implementing inclusive policies that safeguard their interests and allow them to effectively participate in development.\nSustainable Development Goal 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. Our ambition is to modernize our agriculture sector to increase productivity and further develop organic farming. That would ensure food autonomy and accelerate the completion of the regional project of the Indian Ocean Commission to transform Madagascar into the breadbasket of the region. Programmes to combat food insecurity are part of our efforts to achieve the SDGs. Much of the south of the country is in the gripsof chronic drought, and the population living there is suffering greatly from critical food insecurity. As a result, various activities are being carried out to support the efforts of the Madagascan authorities in the light of this critical situation.\nSustainable Development Goal 14 advocates conserving and sustainably using oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The awareness of the need to diversify efforts beyond land- based activities is nothing new. We support Africa\u2019s strategy, which is aimed at creating greater wealth by promoting a flourishing blue economy that is sustainable, secure and respectful of the environment. With this in mind and within the context of the Indian Ocean Commission, a decision was taken to establish the Regional Maritime Information Fusion Centre in Madagascar to prevent threats such as piracy, terrorism, trafficking in its many forms and the plundering of natural resources.\nBy signing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on 22 April and then ratifying it, Madagascar has chosen to participate in the universal movement to transform the world, thereby ensuring the future of our planet \u2014 our sole and unique habitat. Madagascar is one of the countries permanently suffering from the devastating effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we advocate responsible development that preserves the environment. In return, we expect an equal distribution of resources from the Green Climate Fund and the transfer of relevant technologies. We must turn our back on expensive, pollutant energy sources that endanger the environment we share.\nMy country once again calls for the support of the international community and private investors, in particular in the electricity-production sector and in the renovation and expansion of water-distribution infrastructures. These are real investment opportunities. Indeed, if we wish to breathe new life into our planet for the well-being of its population and for the benefit of future generations, we must successfully ensure the transition to new kinds of energy at the national and global levels. We also wish to promote ethical tourism that respects the environment, our ecosystems and our culture.\nToday, I wish to launch an appeal for the transfer of more technology and capital to countries that demonstrate strong potential, such as Madagascar. For our part, we commit to practicing good governance and transparency in the context of a win-win partnership. Both direct foreign investment and overseas development aid are valuable support mechanisms that we should channel in the best possible way and manage effectively in order to achieve the SDGs. That is why my country will invite our partners and international investors to Paris next December for a donor and investor conference in order to mobilize the resources we need for our development programme.\nSeventy-one years following the creation of our Organization, we must acknowledge that much remains to be done in a world where we adjust far too quickly to misery, poverty and the precarious nature of life, where far too quickly we accept injustice and persistent inequality, conflict, crisis and even war. However, we must admit that the United Nations has documented major achievements and progress over the years. We remain firmly convinced that the United Nations today embodies a universal conscience recognized and respected by the international order, as well as political will at the global level. It is a forum where nations can come to plead and explain their cause to the rest of the world. The most important thing is the respect of and follow-up to commitments, which is key to building trust.\nOn 17 June in Paris, upon the initiative of the French authorities, we restarted negotiations concerning the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, Europa and Bassas da India, the latter three located in the Mozambique Channel. Madagascar is delighted at the initiative, which from our point of view is in line with the implementation of the relevant General Assembly resolutions. In paragraph 3 of resolution 34/91, of 12 December 1979, the Assembly\n\u201c[i]nvites the Government of France to initiate negotiations without further delay with the Government of Madagascar for the reintegration of the above-mentioned islands, which were arbitrarily separated from Madagascar\u201d.\nResolution 35/123, of 11 December 1980, supplements the 1979 resolution as it\n\u201c[i]nvites the Government of France to initiate with the Government of Madagascar, as a matter of urgency, the negotiations provided for in resolution 34/91, with a view to settling the question in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations\u201d (resolution 35/123, para. 4).\nMadagascar would hope that the discussions that have been started will take place in full respect of the provisions of the Manila Declaration on the settlement of international disputes, enshrined in resolution 37/10, of 15 November 1982. The resolution underscores, inter alia, the obligations stemming from the fundamental principles of international law concerning the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States as well as the other generally recognized principles and norms of contemporary international law.\nOn matters of peace and security, I wish to reiterate my Government\u2019s gratitude to the United Nations and to the Peacebuilding Support Office, which agreed to the Peacebuilding Fund for Madagascar at the end of 2014. This year marks the operational phase of the Fund\u2019s priority plan, focusing on two main projects: support for reform of the security sector and for governance in Madagascar.\nIn the past 10 years, one man in particular has held high the torch of the United Nations and championed the values and principles that we all share. As I conclude my statement, I wish to pay well-deserved tribute to our dear Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate is coming to an end this year. His commitment to peace and development throughout the world, his personal commitment and the way in which he has headed this Organization have earned our gratitude, esteem and respect.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to express today my highest regard for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and tireless efforts to advance the cause of peace and global harmony. I have deeply appreciated our work together over the past 10 years.\nAs I stand here today, elections to Jordan\u2019s national Parliament are coming to a conclusion. It is one more step on our country\u2019s positive evolutionary path \u2014 a path to which we have insistently conformed despite regional turbulence and a massive refugee burden. It represents an achievement that can be credited largely to our citizens, especially our youth, who have stubbornly held to Jordan\u2019s heritage of unity, strength and forward- looking spirit in spite of the odds. And it is those very odds that make the elections a true triumph of progress over regression.\nAs we gather here today, there are forces at play in my region and beyond whose sole purpose is to stack the odds against the core values that bind our common humanity. I am referring, of course, to the network of extremist terrorists who have dominated headlines of late. And they seek global dominance as well. They want to wipe out our achievements and those of our ancestors, to erase them and drag us back to the Dark Ages.\nThe question we must ask ourselves as we face the battle of our generation is what our legacy will be. Will we pass on to our children a world dominated by dread and division, where safety and security will be at the forefront of their minds as they board an airplane, attend a concert or football match, or stroll through a mall? Most important, are we doing what must be done to confront and decisively defeat this evil force, so that our children can live in a world where fear and suspicion are replaced by human comradery and hope, so they can reach their fullest potential and add to the stockpile of human achievement accrued over the ages?\nAs much as I wish it were otherwise, sadly the answer to those questions is no. How can we be effective in this fight when we have not clearly defined who the enemy is? Who are we fighting with, and who are we fighting against? And I am struck today, after several years of facing the global war on terror, by the lack of understanding of the true nature of Islam that I find among many Western officials, think tanks, media leaders and policymakers. I find myself stating the obvious again and again.\nFalse perceptions of Islam and of Muslims serve to fuel the terrorists\u2019 agenda of a global struggle by polarizing and factionalizing societies East and West \u2014 each side stigmatizing the other and each side driven deeper into mistrust and intolerance. Muslims, a quarter of the world\u2019s population and citizens of every country, have a central role in the future of our planet. Muslim men and women bring the world a rich heritage of civic responsibility, justice, generosity, family life, and faith in God.\nWhen some, out of prejudice or ignorance of what Islam is, seek to exclude Muslims from fulfilling their role, or on the other hand, when the outlaws of Islam, the khawarij, attempt to mislead some Muslims by deforming our religion through false teachings, our societies\u2019 future is put at risk. When the outlaws of Islams, the khawarij, murder, when they plunder, when they exploit children and reject the equality of women before God, they abuse Islam. When the khawarij persecute minorities, when they deny freedom of religion, they abuse Islam.\nIslam teaches that all humanity is equal in dignity. There is no distinction among the various nations or religions or races. The Quran forbids coercion in religion. Every citizen is guaranteed the State\u2019s protection for themselves, their families, their properties, their honour, their privacy, and their freedom of religion and thought. Muslims believe in the divine origins of the Bible and the Torah. God says in the Koran:\n\u201cSay Ye: \u2018We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to the Prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: and we submit to Allah.\u2019\u201d (The Holy Koran, II:136)\nIndeed, the prophet mentioned most in the Koran is Moses, named 136 times. Jesus, whom we call \u201cChrist Messiah,\u201d is named 25 times. His mother, Mary, called \u201cbest of all women in creation,\u201d is named 35 times, and there is a chapter in the Quran called Maryam. The khawarij deliberately hide these truths about Islam in order to drive Muslims and non-Muslims apart. We cannot allow that to happen. Once we understand that this is a battle that we must fight together \u2014 all religions and all of us who believe in the dignity, freedom, and well-being that is the birthright of every individual \u2014 then we can turn towards our common enemy and examine through a clear lens the unique nature of our foe.\nLet me state clearly that those radical outlaw groups do not exist on the fringes of Islam. They are altogether outside of it. Thus, we refer to them as khawarij: outlaws of Islam. They declare the entire civilized world as the enemy and all people, military or civilian, as fair game. They aim to incubate satellite caliphates in every country of the world in order to extend their reach. They are also expanding fast and wide through their mastery and exploitation of modern technology, including social media. To confront this non-traditional enemy, we need non-traditional means, a new mindset, new partnerships and reformed methodologies. For Muslims, first and foremost this is a fight for our future. All elements of our community have a role to play, not only in mosques and religious centers, but media, schools, and communities. Let no one be misled: traditional Sunni Islam and all of its schools of jurisprudence decisively reject the ideas and claims of the takfiri jihadists. Muslims need to help identify and counter the outlaws of Islam who pick and choose and cut and paste religious texts in order to twist and distort true Islamic teaching.\nThe international community also faces a fight for the future. The war will not be fought on the battlefield alone. Our adversary has brought the fight to every place where humans live and interact: airports, cafes and city streets. Security cooperation is imperative, but equally important is a holistic approach. We need to open up new channels between continents and nations, within countries and among people. That means reforming the way we communicate, share information and use our technologies. The very same modern communication tools used against us must be employed by us, and we can do that while respecting the important issue of privacy. Creative innovators in the private sector, especially in the technology sector, are vital for our future and must be brought on board.\nOurs is a global fight. The focus must not stop with the Middle East, but must reach far beyond into West and East Africa, South-East Asia and the Balkans. In Syria, a military approach will leave no winners, but only losers on every side and further civilian suffering. Ending violence ultimately demands a political process \u2014 one shepherded by a unified global vision and led by all of the Syrian people. In Iraq, international support remains critical as the Government and the people continue to uproot the khawarij. However, key to achieving and sustaining any success is an inclusive approach that engages all components of the country in the political process and in State institutions.\nAs we pursue those goals, the international community must also take responsibility for those whose lives have been crushed and who have been impoverished. I am referring to the millions of refugees and victims. We cannot decisively defeat the scourge of terror and violence without decisively rooting out the injustices that provide it with fertile ground. From the Abu Ghraib prison to the streets of Kabul and schools in Aleppo, injustice and humiliation have left tremendous human suffering in their wake.\nNo injustice has spread more bitter fruit than the denial of a Palestinian State. I believe that peace is a conscious decision. Israel has to embrace peace, or eventually be engulfed in a sea of hatred in a region of turmoil. Safeguarding Jerusalem is a key concern, as the Holy City is a strategic linchpin not only for my region but for the world.\nThat is a priority for me personally and for all Muslims. We utterly reject attacks on Muslim and Christian holy sites and any attempts to alter the historic Muslim, Christian and Arab identity of the Holy City. As the Custodian of Islamic Holy Sites in Jerusalem, I will continue my efforts to protect those places and stand up against all violations of their sanctity, including attempts to establish temporal and spatial divisions restricting free use of the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Haram Al-Sharif.\nPerhaps the central and most vital battleground for this defining war of our generation is the mind. The despicable, damaging ideology of hate, murder and self- destruction that is being spread in crash courses online and elsewhere must be confronted with a counter- narrative of hope, tolerance and peace. Together, in the General Assembly and in our regions, countries and communities across the world, we have the power to create that counter-narrative. Let us show that we also have the will to act.\n"

        "file_text": "More than ever before, we share a common destiny. The destiny of everyone here is also our destiny, and we can master the challenges of the future only if we face them together. That is why we have the United Nations. That is why we meet in this Assembly.\nToday, we are doing so at a time marked by the destructive forces of war and the tragic plight of refugees, such as the unspeakable horror of Syria, girls abducted and enslaved by Boko Haram, or teenagers on the run who are in search of opportunity but have never attended school. It is also marked by the return of geopolitical rivalries and isolationism. The basic tenets of our coexistence are being challenged. Acts of aggression are changing borders; nuclear weapons are proliferating and being tested; human dignity is being denied. We are being revisited by the spectres of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism, autocracy and fear-mongering. Walls are being erected.\nWe must and we can respond to that by empowering people, by strengthening democracy, good governance and the rule of law, by celebrating diversity, by keeping our economies open and pushing for trade, so that we can create decent jobs for all, by committing to arresting climate change in order to save our planet, by setting ambitious goals for sustainable development, by pursuing peace through diplomacy, and by seeking solutions through collaboration.\nHigh on our global agenda are the issues of migration and refugees. As we have heard so many times already this week, 65 million people are fleeing from harm. The international community must live up to its commitments by providing protection for refugees and guaranteeing the right to seek asylum. That is a global responsibility, to be shouldered cooperatively and addressed comprehensively and through shared governance. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), which the Assembly adopted earlier this week, is a first step. But there are many more to take. Fundamentally, we need to redouble resettlement efforts, which are the most important way to help refugees. And at the same time, we must harness the positive effects of safe and orderly migration.\nThe United Nations must adapt to a changing environment. The Organization has achieved a great deal in 71 years, but it falls short of our expectations. It is time for serious reforms that can make it fit for purpose. To succeed, we need a strong, visionary and courageous leadership, dedicated to change, to turning ambitions into concrete action and to delivering on the recent groundbreaking multilateral achievements on climate change, sustainable development and peace.\nWe need the States Members of the United Nations to heed and lead that call for change. The prevention of armed conflict must be at the core of our action. We should make full use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, which remains underutilized. Early warnings should be followed by early action. Resolution 70/262, on sustaining peace, adopted by the Assembly earlier this year, provides a strong framework on which to base effective prevention and peacebuilding. Working with and through regional organizations will make the United Nations more effective in its quest to sustain peace. It is particularly important to find ways to sustainably finance regional and subregional organizations\u2019 peace operations.\nAnother area requiring determined action is gender equality. We call for a true shift in the way we approach global efforts aimed at achieving gender equality. Ultimately, it is our task to enhance rights, representation and resources for women and girls all around the world, by increasing women\u2019s participation in peace processes, protecting them against gender- based violence in humanitarian crises and strengthening their political and economic empowerment. The United Nations can lead the way by improving the gender balance in its system and having a gender-responsive budget of its own, and by using gender-disaggregated data when dealing with matters of peace and conflict, including in the Security Council.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a political road map for reform. It requires the United Nations to offer comprehensive advice and support to Governments on how to shape and develop societies on issues ranging from tax reform to decent jobs. It also requires the United Nations to monitor developed countries, while assisting middle-income countries in their efforts to build inclusive and accountable institutions and sustainable prosperity.\nTo achieve that, we must strengthen and reform the financing of the United Nations. All branches of its development system should make full use of their respective mandates and specialties, working together and avoiding duplication. Collaborative efforts should be rewarded. That is the only way that the United Nations, with its limited resources, will be able to make a greater impact at the country level and support the efforts of all Member States to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A United Nations conference to be co-hosted by Fiji and Sweden in 2017 will focus on SDG 14, with the goal of conserving and using sustainably our oceans, seas and marine resources.\nSecurity is something we must build together. It is something we share, and that notion compels us to contest the false logic of confrontation and geopolitical zero-sum games. Instead, it can lead us to emphasize de-escalation and disarmament, mediation and dialogue, conflict prevention and peacebuilding. That is a cornerstone of Swedish security policy. It is our basic approach to security in both our immediate and global neighbourhoods.\nIndeed, the importance of cooperation increases with the transboundary nature of threats. Internal and external security are more interlinked than ever before. Therefore, we must improve our common tools for crisis management, equip the next generation of peace operations with more robust mandates and adequate resources and strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, including the European Union and the African Union.\nBut we cannot ignore the key to achieving peace: political will. And for peace to be sustainable, the root causes of conflict must be tackled and the rules of our multilateral world order respected. Peace accords are not implemented, and resolutions, mandates and decisions by the Security Council are disregarded. This is unacceptable. It challenges the authority of the Security Council and the rules-based international order itself.\nThe Middle East peace process has stalled. The parties are far apart, trust is lacking and the situation on the ground is deteriorating. The occupation must end, international law must be observed and the two-State solution must be revitalized. The Security Council has a huge responsibility. Other initiatives to revive the peace process, such as the Arab Peace Initiative and the French initiative, should be supported by all of us. Sweden is honoured to lead the work on involving civil society in the French initiative.\nIn Europe, Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and military presence in eastern Ukraine constitute breaches of international law and principles of the European security order agreed by all participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. All parties must do their part so that Ukraine can regain control over its internationally recognized borders.\nIf we want peace, we need to plan for peace and sustain peace. This is equally critical in the vulnerable aftermath of violent conflict. As more areas are liberated from Da\u2019esh and other terrorist groups, we must take action to win peace; we must, at the very least, mitigate and stabilize the situation in liberated areas. To meet this challenge, our tools must be developed and cooperation enhanced.\nThe United Nations is central to political processes, the delivery of immediate relief, and efforts for long- term development, including State-building. I welcome the fact that the United Nations is now exploring responses for stabilization. Sweden believes that closer cooperation in this field between the United Nations and the European Union, politically and on the ground, would be beneficial. We should be ready to provide such comprehensive support to Iraq.\nI wish to thank the General Assembly once again for electing Sweden as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. We take its strong support as a vote of confidence for our foreign policy of solidarity and global commitment. We also see it as a call for a Security Council that addresses challenges to international peace and security in a comprehensive, inclusive and transparent manner. We are ready to assume our share of responsibility for the entire Council agenda.\nWe will bring our foreign policy perspectives with us in fulfilling this assignment \u2014 those of preventing armed conflict, sustaining peace, the necessity of including women in peace processes and an understanding of security that stresses the links to sustainable development. We will continue to talk with, not only about, countries, and we will remain true to our principles. Swedish foreign policy rests firmly on international law, respect for human rights, gender equality and a humanitarian perspective.\n\u201cToday is the last day of the war.\u201d That is what the Colombian magazine Semana wrote on 23 June this year. More than 50 years of conflict have passed. Hundreds of thousands have been killed. Millions were on the run. Let us pay our respects to the victims. Let us welcome the peace agreement. But let us also remember what is unique about this agreement. The architects were not only the Government and the guerrillas. Victims of the conflict, women\u2019s organizations and civil society were also involved. Peace does not come about because it is printed in a headline. It happens step by step, because of the courage of ordinary people. It happens when people organize a meeting to form a political party to voice their demands or print a pamphlet or use social media to rally for their cause. It happens when women and girls claim their human rights, when civil society and trade unions grow, making societies and economies more participatory and inclusive. Such is the fabric of lasting peace and such is the task of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of India and on my own behalf, I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his service to the United Nations, the largest peace movement in history.\nA year has passed since I stood here at this hallowed rostrum to address the members of the international community (see A/70/PV.22). Since then, many things have changed in the world around us \u2014 some for the better, some for the worse, and many that have been a cause for great concern. There can be no better platform to ponder our actions and our achievements over the past year. We must remember that we will be defined not just by our actions but, equally, by our inaction.\nA number of issues have been debated in the General Assembly, from the necessity of global partnerships in sharing new vaccines and promoting access to affordable drugs to counter antimicrobial resistance to the need for faster implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, from the challenges of ensuring well-ordered mobility of productive human resources to the necessity of adequate consultations with troop-contributing countries before framing mandates for United Nations peacekeeping operations. However, since my time is limited, I would therefore focus on only some of the most pressing issues facing the international community.\nThe true challenges of our time are to end the curse of harsh poverty, which still lurks in so many corners of our world, to ensure that the fruits of growing prosperity reach those who need it most, to take forward the mission of gender equality and protect women where progress on gender issues has lapsed, and to ensure peace across borders, not least because there can be no prosperity without peace.\nI congratulate the President of the General Assembly for giving priority to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making them central to the theme of the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. I am happy that the 17 Goals adopted by the Assembly are in line with the development vision of my Government, which has been geared in recent years towards the achievement of these very objectives.\nUnder the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign \u2014 the Clean India mission \u2014 more than 400,000 toilets have been constructed in over 200,000 schools. Similarly, in terms of gender equality, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign \u2014 Educate the Girl Child, Save the Girl Child programme \u2014 has become a nationwide movement led by women. The Make in India initiative is receiving international acclaim. Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan- Dhan Yojana initiative, the largest financial inclusion programme the world has ever seen, nearly 250 million bank accounts have been opened for the poor. Digital India is transforming the country. Under the Skill India Initiative, a number of programmes have been undertaken to enable young people to take advantage of the demographic dividend. Those initiatives have added a new dimension to India\u2019s growth story, making it the fastest-growing major economy in the world at a time of slow global growth.\nWe are all aware that one sixth of humankind lives in India. Accordingly, global success in realizing the SDGs depends on the success achieved in India. We are committed to the wholehearted implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a national effort. We have decided to dedicate one day in each session of our Parliament to discussions relating solely to the SDGs, which will enable us to consistently monitor the progress made on them and give us good results. However, for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in a globalized world, national efforts need to be supplemented by international cooperation.\nClimate change is yet another serious challenge we are having to confront. There are enough resources on this planet to fulfil everyone\u2019s needs, but not enough to satisfy anyone\u2019s greed, for greed is limitless. In that context, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has championed a new concept, namely, climate justice. If we respect nature, nature will respect and nurture us and future generations. However, if we exploit nature mindlessly then we must be mindful that nature will unleash its fury upon us. In different parts of the world, we have already seen nature drift towards the unnatural \u2014 from torrential rains to excessive heat, from tsunamis to storms and cloudbursts.\nWe must curb reckless consumption and adopt lifestyles in harmony with nature. Yoga, the storehouse of India\u2019s ancient wisdom, epitomizes a sustainable lifestyle. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the unprecedented global response to the International Day of Yoga, which has been celebrated for the past two years.\nIn the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities has been acknowledged and accepted. That makes it clear that, while our responsibility is common, our obligations are different. Developed nations must discharge their responsibility in the search for the common good through finance and technology transfer.\nIndia has launched an ambitious domestic effort to transform our energy mix and attain 40 per cent energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. The massive investments required entail a predictable and stable environment, towards which we are actively working. Additionally, our ground-breaking initiative for an International Solar Energy Alliance is intended to make efficient solar technology available for all.\nI assure the General Assembly that India will continue to play a leading role in combating climate change. We have carefully chosen the date to submit our instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which will be 2 October, the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, who epitomized a lifestyle with the smallest possible carbon footprint.\nLet me now turn to a subject of critical importance, and which deeply concerns every member of the Assembly. This month we marked the fifteenth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack on this city. Tragically, less than 15 days ago, another attempt at killing innocents was made in an act of terror on this same city. We, who have suffered in Uri, Kashmir, recently, understand the pain inflicted by the same forces. The world has been battling this scourge for a very long time. However, despite the blood and tears of innocent victims, attacks this year alone in Kabul, Dhaka, Istanbul, Mogadishu, Brussels, Bangkok, Paris, Pathankot and Uri, as well as the daily barbaric tragedies in Syria and Iraq, remind us that these malevolent forces have yet to be defeated.\nWe must acknowledge that terrorism is undoubtedly the greatest of all violations of human rights. We must accept this fact as a first principle. Terrorism targets the innocent and kills indiscriminately. Having gone far beyond affecting individuals or nations, it is a crime against humanity itself. But it is important to ask: who is behind this and who benefits from it? Terrorists do not own banks or weapons factories, so let us ask the question of who finances these terrorists, who arms them and who provides them sanctuary. Similar questions were asked by the Vice-President of Afghanistan from this rostrum a few days ago (see A/71/PV.11).\nHistory proves that those who plant the seeds of extremist ideology reap a bitter harvest. The contagion of evil seen in small terrorist groups has grown into a hydra-headed monster backed by technological sophistication that threatens the peace and harmony of our world. We will not be able to win the fight against terrorism by making specious distinctions between the problems of one group and the problems of others \u2014 between terrorists who attack some and those who attack others. We do not know who will be the next victim of Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\nIf we want to defeat terrorism, therefore, there is only one way, that is, to unite despite our differences, add steel to our resolve and inject urgency into our response. We need to forget our prejudices and join hands to draw up an effective strategy against terror. That is not an impossible task, provided that we have the will. We can do it, and we must do it; otherwise, future generations will forever hold us to account. And if any nation refuses to join the global strategy, then we must isolate it. That is my simple demand.\nThere are nations in our midst that still speak the language of terrorism. They nurture it, peddle it and export it. Sheltering terrorists has become the calling card of such nations. We must identify those nations and hold them to account. The nations in which United Nations-designated terrorists roam freely and which lead demonstrations and deliver their poisonous sermons of hate with impunity are as culpable as the very terrorists whom they harbour. There should be no place for such countries in the community of nations.\nOn 21 September, the Prime Minister of Pakistan used this rostrum to make baseless allegations about human rights violations in my country (see A/71/ PV.11). I can say only that those accusing others of human rights violations would do well to look within and see what egregious abuses they are perpetrating in their own countries, including in Baluchistan. The brutality against the Baluch people represents the worst form of State oppression.\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan also said that India had come up with preconditions for talks that he found unacceptable. What preconditions was he talking about? Did we impose any preconditions before extending an invitation to him to attend our Government\u2019s oath- taking ceremony? Did we impose any preconditions when I went to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process and agreed to commence the comprehensive bilateral dialogue with Pakistan? Did we impose any preconditions when Prime Minister Modi travelled from Kabul to Lahore? What preconditions? What are we talking about?\nWe took the initiative to resolve issues not on the basis of conditions, but on the basis of friendship. That is the truth. We have in fact attempted to establish an unprecedented paradigm of friendship in the past two years. We conveyed Eid greetings to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, wished success to his cricket team and extended good wishes for his health and well-being. Did any of that come with preconditions attached?\nAnd what did we get in return? Pathankot, Bahadur Ali and Uri? Are we imposing preconditions or are the Pakistanis now going in a different direction? Bahadur Ali is a terrorist in our custody whose confession is proof of Pakistan\u2019s complicity in cross-border terror. But when confronted with such evidence, Pakistan continues to deny it. Pakistan persists in the belief that such attacks will enable it to acquire the territory it covets. My firm advice to Pakistan is to abandon that dream. Let me state unequivocally that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and will always remain so. That is why Pakistan should abandon that dream.\nAs I said at the outset, we will be judged by both our action and our inaction. What goals have we achieved and what objectives remain unfulfilled? The first pending task for the Assembly is the adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which was proposed by India in 1996. In 2016, despite the fact that two decades have elapsed, we have yet to conclude an agreement. As a result, we are unable to develop a standard under which terrorists shall be prosecuted or extradited. I therefore appeal to the General Assembly that it act with fresh resolve and urgency to adopt that critical convention.\nThe second pending task is Security Council reform. Just as we need a more contemporary approach to combating terrorism, we also need a less outdated Security Council, which currently reflects the world order of a bygone era. The vast majority of nations share the belief that the United Nations should not remain frozen in 1945, which serves only the interests of a few. Whether it is a question of institutions or issues, we must come to terms with present-day realities and the challenges we have before us. An expansion in the permanent and non-permanent Council categories of membership in order to reflect contemporary realities is therefore an urgent necessity. We must move forward substantively through the intergovernmental negotiations towards a text-based negotiation.\nIf both of the long-pending issues that I mentioned are addressed during the presidency of Mr. Thomson, then the success of the seventy-first session will be assured.\nThe twenty-first century has begun in the shadow of turmoil, but we can turn it into a golden age in the history of civilization through united and concerted efforts. But we must remember that what happens tomorrow will depend on what we do today.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to be here today for the first time to represent the Argentine Republic before the General Assembly.\nWe are living in a time of great global transformation, where changes take place at an increasingly rapid pace and provide us with new opportunities. In the twenty- first century we are faced with a continuous challenge, namely, that of adapting to the new realities of global interdependency. Building a modern international order is an ongoing task in which we are all protagonists.\nThe principles of the Organization guide us to encourage dialogue and cooperation between our countries in order to achieve development, peace and international security. In the first 71 years of the United Nations, important advances have been made. However, there is still much to be done. The United Nations has proposed a horizon towards which we should advance. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a goal that we should approach collectively.\nI am proud to represent a country that has contributed to the international legal framework, driving advances in human rights, humanitarian rights and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. With the Sustainable Development Goals in mind, it makes us proud that our Governmental priorities are in line with those of the international community. In Argentina, we have set ourselves three main objectives.\nOur first goal is to move towards zero poverty. That means becoming a country with equal opportunities, where our children can shape their future and where every Argentinian is able to develop his or her potential. A country like ours, which is a food\u2013producing powerhouse, cannot accept the fact that there are people going hungry anywhere the world.\nOur second goal is to defeat drug trafficking. The world drug problem, addiction and violence associated with organized crime requires that we work together towards a comprehensive agenda, based on human rights and focused on both supply and demand.\nOur third goal is to unite Argentinians through dialogue, respect for the rule of law and the strengthening of democracy. For in the twenty-first century, the quality of political leadership is measured by the ability to build bridges and create trust. These are elements that every society needs to properly function. Argentinians have chosen that path, namely, that of trusting one another, engaging in dialogue and speaking honestly to each other.\nAn important step in this direction was working on the problems of the past in order to be able to look towards the future. We have rebalanced the macroeconomy and began to strengthen relations with our neighbouring countries. We are establishing mature links with other countries and multilateral organizations, and we are already starting to see results. We have returned to international credit markets, and many companies have demonstrated that they trust Argentina. New investments are announced every day, which will lead to jobs and put the country on track to expand its economy. Argentines are ready to enter into the twenty-first century and assume our role in the international community.\nHowever, we cannot achieve any of those goals alone. We have to work together, starting with our neighbours. I am from a region that thinks of itself as a common neighbourhood with shared challenges. In recent years, Latin America has made huge efforts to reduce poverty, thanks to robust social policies and to the very favourable international economic conditions. But today the context is different. All of our countries have experienced diminished growth, while global trade has shown weak performance. At the regional level, the balance of trade is less favourable and inflation punishes those who have less.\nBut we in Argentina are optimistic. We know that, in order to grow inclusively, Latin America must count on a tremendous amount of human talent as well as incomparable natural wealth. While in the world there are trends that generate worry and uncertainty, encouraging news is coming from our region, such as the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States and the peacebuilding process in Colombia. In addition, we see conditions for creating a corridor of peace from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean throughout the region, which will contribute to regional stability and prosperity.\nBut the challenges of global governance in the twenty-first century do not exclusively belong to some countries or regions; they concern everyone. We must cooperate, while thinking globally and acting locally and without losing sight of the first principle of this Organization, which is based on the sovereign equality of all of its Members. A world with more voices is a more just world. That is why it is important that we continue building a system based on clear rules that reflect diversity and plurality and that facilitate consensus.\nClimate change is the greatest, most important challenge that humankind faces. Only if we are aware of that fact will we be able to make progress without jeopardizing our future and the future of future generations. We in Argentina are betting ambitiously on renewable energy to develop our potential in areas such as solar, wind and biomass energy generation. We signed the Paris Agreement and we are proud of being one of the first countries to complete the ratification process. That is why we call upon the international community to put forth its greatest efforts so that we can soon see the Agreement enter into force, which is so important for our future.\nAnother major challenge is the problem of refugees. Although a year ago we made a commitment to leave nobody behind, the images we see today hurt and worry us. This reality calls for us to do more. Our White Helmets are widely recognized for their commitment to humanitarian matters, which is why, last May, Argentina was present in the Syrian conflict zone to offer assistance at a refugee camp in Lebanon. I would like to announce that we are going to accept even more refugees from Syria and from its neighbouring countries, favouring families with children. We have established a national cabinet of ministers charged with broadening the existing humanitarian programme, which coordinates ministries and Governmental departments and addresses security measures and full social integration. We will be able to gradually increase our ability to receive more people to the extent that financial support, technical assistance and international logistical support allow us to do.\nGender equality is also a primary goal of ours, upon which we have to work with conviction and political determination. Argentina is making the full empowerment of women its State policy. We have established a national action plan for prevention and assistance for women at risk in order to put an end to violence against women in all of its forms. We are working with a cross-cutting approach so that women will have the same social, political, economic and cultural opportunities in the country as men. In this regard, we are grateful for the support that Susana Malcorra, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, has received as a candidate to be the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. In the twenty-first century, having a woman as the head of the Organization would be a very encouraging example.\nWhen the Organization was founded, countries assumed the commitment of maintaining international peace and security. However, we live in a world that is increasingly violent, where radical extremism threatens innocent people and vulnerable populations. It should be remembered that, in 1992 and in 1994, Argentina was a victim of international terrorism, with two attacks, for which we hope to receive greater international cooperation in clarifying events and punishing those responsible. My country condemns any group that through its actions aims to promote terror in any part of the planet.\nIn recent years, this phenomenon has worsened. To stop it, international cooperation is indispensable. We have to promote development both inside and outside of our countries because development does not stop at the border. Growth with inclusion, dialogue and tolerance \u2014 and the creation of opportunities \u2014 all help to reduce the marginalization and humiliation that fuels the recruitment of terrorists.\nDialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes make up the cornerstone of the foreign policy of a democratic Argentina. That is why I reiterate our call for dialogue with the United Kingdom, as called for in many resolutions of this Organization, so as to amicably resolve the sovereignty dispute that we have had for almost two centuries over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. We have shown interest in advancing our bilateral relationship, which can and should be mutually beneficial. That is why we trust that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this prolonged dispute.\nI would like to conclude with a thought. Argentina, which has just celebrated 200 years of independence, is a country that has always opened its doors to men and women from around the world seeking a better life. There is a piece of each part of the world in my country. We coexist peacefully \u2014 Christians, Jews and Muslims. Diversity enriches our society, and we embrace openness within a world where fragmentation is burgeoning. Let us say to the world, we need not fear interdependency. This world is our shared home, which is why we must take care of it. We must learn to coexist peacefully, just as Pope Francis has called upon on us to do. Fostering a sense of integration and working\n30/56 16-29296 together will only strengthen us. Let us continue to build networks and bridge gaps. The members of the Assembly can count on Argentina. We have much to say and to contribute.\nPlease allow me to extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his work in leading the Organization. His legacy has difficult challenges, which is why we must continue with our efforts. Over the years, the United Nations has shown us the importance of pursuing a better world. Now it is time for us to put forth all of our creativity and political will to make our vision of a better world a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased today to congratulate Mr. Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. The Government of Barbados is pleased that Fiji, a fellow small island developing State (SIDS), has been elevated to such an important office. Forty- six years ago, the Prime Minister of Barbados, The Honourable Errol Walton Barrow, in his address to this body, congratulated Fiji on its attainment of independence (see A/PV.1866). He pointed out that Barbados was especially pleased to have been one of the sponsors of resolution 2622 (XXV), admitting Fiji to the United Nations. I assure the President of the full support and cooperation of the Barbados delegation as he discharges his duties.\nI extend sincere thanks to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his steady guidance of the work of the General Assembly during its seventieth session.\nI also take this opportunity to recognize the contribution of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose tenure is drawing to an end. Secretary-General Ban has been a dedicated and committed leader of the Organization. He has been a friend of SIDS, including Barbados. The Government of Barbados extends sincere appreciation for his dedicated global service during a turbulent but productive period.\nThe seventy-first session is of deep significance to Barbados. It coincides with the celebration this year of two historic anniversaries. On 30 November, we celebrate our fiftieth anniversary of independence and nationhood, followed closely by our fiftieth anniversary of membership in the United Nations.\nOne of the cornerstones on which the foreign policy of Barbados is built is our unwavering commitment to the United Nations. We see the United Nations as the core of an effective multilateral system, with responsibility for addressing issues of international peace, security and development. Today, 50 years on, Barbados stands more firmly committed to the principle of multilateralism. For the United Nations to deliver on our expectations, its organizational structure must reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. We therefore support efforts to reform the Security Council and to revitalize the General Assembly.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly is \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. We must act now to make the vision of 2030 a reality. Barbados believes that partnership and collaboration will be the keys to fulfilling the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That is especially true for SIDS.\nThe Prime Minister of Barbados, Mr. Freundel Stuart, addressed this theme in his statement to the Alliance of Small Island States Leaders\u2019 Conference, held in the margins of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States in September 2014. Prime Minister Stuart highlighted the importance of United Nations support for the implementation of the SIDS Agenda. We therefore welcome the progress made by the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) in its comprehensive review of the United Nations system\u2019s support for SIDS, and we look forward to tangible improvements as a result of its work.\nLast week, I was pleased to participate in the launch, in Barbados, of the Caribbean Human Development Report 2016. The theme of the report is \u201cMultidimensional progress: human resilience beyond income\u201d. It highlights the unique situation of the small island developing States and low-lying coastal States in the Caribbean. Three central issues stand out: vulnerability, resilience and sustainability. Barbados welcomes the report. It validates the consistent call by the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and of SIDS in general, for SIDS to be recognized as a special case for sustainable development.\nThe Government of Barbados is devising and implementing effective strategies to strengthen social, economic and environmental resilience that is consistent with our national growth and development philosophy. It is based on supporting a Barbados that is socially balanced, economically viable, environmentally sound, and characterized by good governance \u2014 our four strategic pillars. We are therefore pleased that Barbados is already pursuing the ideals enshrined in Agenda 2030.\nThe existential threat which climate change poses to small island developing States like Barbados is well documented. We are a leading advocate for coordinated action at the international level to address the sources and consequences of our vulnerability. The Prime Minister of Barbados was one of the leaders who participated in the formal signing ceremony of the landmark Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April. He deposited the instrument of ratification on the same occasion. We look forward to its early entry into force. At the national level, Barbados has developed a national climate change policy framework that works seamlessly with the Barbados sustainable development policy to address issues of climate adaptation and mitigation.\nBarbados exercises jurisdiction over maritime space that far exceeds its very limited land territory. We therefore recognize the vast potential of the ocean and its sustainable exploitation as an important component of our future development. We are also developing a comprehensive national ocean governance strategyto address the sustainable management of our maritime space and the sustainable use of Barbados\u2019 marine living and non-living resources.\nAs we seek to protect and preserve our oceans and seas for future generations, Barbados will continue to participate actively in the various oceans-related processes of the United Nations. During the current session, my delegation will collaborate with other members of the Association of Caribbean States to strengthen the level of support for the Caribbean Sea resolution. Our ultimate aim is the designation of the Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of sustainable development. We count on your support.\nBarbadians are a proud and industrious people. With minimal natural resources and the constraints of small size and vulnerability to natural and man-made disasters, our people have achieved a significant level of human development in 50 years of independence. We have done so by dint of hard work, sacrifice and faith. We remain resolute in our determination to overcome the many obstacles we face: the unilateral and unidimensional graduation policies of international development agencies that penalize us for progress in human development, while ignoring our obvious vulnerabilities; the negative impact of the economic and financial decisions of international financial and other institutions, illustrated by the consequences of de-risking on correspondent banking activity; and the persistent and unwarranted attacks on our international financial services sector, accompanied by the imposition of onerous conditionalities. Those actions threaten our economic stability and our ability to participate in global financial, trade and economic systems. They undermine our capacity to achieve the full implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. We call for dialogue with development partners and greater policy space and policy flexibility for SIDS.\nThe United Nations was born of the post-war desire of nations for international peace and security.\nBarbados is a firm proponent of the rule of law at the national, regional and international levels. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining the Caribbean as a zone of peace. In that context, Barbados reaffirms its unwavering support for the territorial integrity of fellow CARICOM States Belize and Guyana. We call for definitive solutions to their long-standing disputes with neighbouring States Guatemala and Venezuela. Barbados welcomes the recent steady progress towards the normalization of bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States of America. We look forward to the dismantling of the final vestiges of that long- standing embargo.\nOn that memorable evening on 30 November 1966, as the national flag of Barbados was unfurled for the first time, there was a sense of exultation, expectation and pride. Our first Prime Minister stated in his first address to the General Assembly:\n\u201cHumility must be the most appropriate feeling for the leader of a State admitted to membership of this illustrious Assembly on the basis of sovereign equality.\u201d (A/PV.1487, para. 72)\nHalf a century later, we believe that both independence and membership in the United Nations have served us well and afforded us the opportunity to pursue the goals which have informed the progress that we have achieved. Looking forward, we are committed to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We expect it to guarantee further development of the Barbadian economy and society and to serve as our contribution to the universal push to transform our world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and privilege for me to be addressing the Assembly for the first time since I took office as President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\nFirst allow me to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General Assembly at this session, and to wish him the greatest success in his work. I also thank his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, for his excellent work during the previous session. I would also like express our appreciation for the theme chosen for this session, under President Thomson\u2019s important sponsorship, which focuses on the issue of sustainable development.\nGuinea-Bissau believes that this session is an opportunity to strengthen the commitments made as well as the division of responsibilities among all international actors in pursuit of the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda (resolution 69/313) for development financing, approved by the General Assembly in July 2015, gave rise to fresh hope with regard to financing for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The commitments made by the parties must be respected. The goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda are complementary and must be harmonized and aligned.\nMy country is strongly committed to doing our part in implementing the commitments made in the context of global and regional strategies. Thus we are proud of the fact that our national development plan is in line with many of the Goals of the Agenda and also of the political will demonstrated by the national authorities to gradually adjust this strategic plan in order to fully accommodate the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nGuinea-Bissau has very important natural capital to leverage for our development and for the preservation of the environment in the West Africa ecoregion. Thus biodiversity has become an axis that cuts across all other aspects of my country\u2019s development.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to briefly share with the Assembly the current political situation and the efforts that have been made to overcome the institutional challenges that our country faces, particularly our political authorities.\nJust before I left to attend this session, thanks to the mediation of the Heads of State of Guinea Conakry and Sierra Leone, who were in my country recently, in accordance with a decision reached at the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), held in Dakar, an agreement was signed with a view to overcoming the current roadblocks in our Parliament. The agreement was signed by the President of the National Popular Assembly, the Prime Minister and the two main political parties.\nThe understanding reached deserves the full support of the President of the Republic, ECOWAS and other partners of Guinea-Bissau as an important step toward the easing of political tensions and a consensus platform that will allow us to ensure Government stability until the end of the legislative term.\nThe endorsement of this understanding by the Heads of State of ECOWAS and the international community, which met yesterday to discuss the way forward to implementing the agreement, rauses the hope that all parties are strongly committed to establishing peace and stability so as to allow the agreement to be implemented.\nTherefore, allow me to reiterate my commitment to do all that is required, through a frank and open dialogue with all active forces in our country, in order to consolidate an environment of peace and social stability, which are indispensable to a process of stable governance in our country.\nI should note, however, that today the Bissau-Guinean crisis is no longer a political and military crisis, but merely, and eminently, a political and institutional crisis. I should also note that, from the outset of my term, not a single shot has been fired by military or paramilitary personnel; no one has been killed or beaten for political reasons; there have been no reported cases of arbitrary arrest; there is freedom of expression, the press and demonstration; and no issues of human rights violations have been raised.\nAs Supreme Commander of the armed forces, I would also like to reiterate to the Assembly our request for United Nations support for the process of national reconciliation that is under way in our country; for the participation of our armed forces in international peacekeeping missions; for the implementation of safety and security-sector reform, which is of great importance, namely with respect to the control of weapons and the management of materiel; the construction of armories and the renovation of barracks; and the securing of funds for the reintegration of demobilized troops.\nThe world today faces a tremendous challenge: combating and overcoming the scourges of terrorism, drug trafficking, climate change and other evils that are ravaging our countries. These threats are clear evidence of the security challenges that we face on our shared planet.\nOur subregion, West Africa, is also affected by acts of terrorism, which represent an intolerable manifestation of barbarism and of disdain for the most sacred values of humanity. I wish to take this unique opportunity to once again express my country\u2019s solidarity with the countries and peoples that are victims of terrorism and reiterate our commitment to them.\nGuinea-Bissau welcomes the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and calls for its implementation as a key tool for regulating international dialogue and cooperation among States, which hold in their hands the fate of the planet.\nClimate change poses an emerging risk for Guinea- Bissau. We are a coastal country, with an island portion and a high risk of sea-level rise, which poses a great threat to a significant portion of our territory. Therefore, climate change matters are some of the main priorities of our political action. Accordingly, we have great interest in participating in and closely monitoring the High-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 on conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development \u2014 which will take place in New York in 2017. The President of the General Assembly is therefore in the right place to fulfil the mission the Assembly has assigned to him in this regard.\nIn the past year, we have observed an important development in the international context, namely, the rapprochement between the United States and Cuba, which we greatly welcomed. We hope that the normalization of bilateral relations may bring these two friends of Guinea-Bissau closer together. In addition, we call for the implementation of the resolutions calling for a two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security.\nI would like to take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission for their continued focus on, solidarity with, and ongoing monitoring of Guinea-Bissau, its people and its authorities, even in an environment of multiple and complex challenges. In addition, on behalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau, I would also like to recognize and thank the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), its Commission and its member States for their political, financial and military support in the process of stabilizing, securing and reforming the safety and security sectors.\nI would like to offer a word of appreciation to Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Chair of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government, and special thanks to President Alpha Cond\u00e9 of Guinea for his role in facilitating the dialogue in the political process in Guinea-Bissau. We also offer our profound gratitude to Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria, for his unwavering support as head of the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau. I further convey our gratitude to all heads of State in the subregion, who have given a high level of attention to Guinea-Bissau during the years our political crisis persisted.\nOur recognition of and gratitude to all other international partners, countries and organizations, namely, the African Union, the West African Economic and Monetary Union, the European Union, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Population Fund and the International Organization of la Francophonie, which have always stood with Guinea-Bissau and supported our country in its pursuit of paths leading to stability and development. The support of our international partners, as seen in the results of the Brussels round table in 2015, unequivocally translates into attention to the situation of the State and the people of Guinea- Bissau. As promised, we count on our partners\u2019 help to leverage economic development as the engine for peace and stability in our country.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our appreciation for the United Nations and the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea- Bissau, which kept their attention on and unflaggingly monitored Guinea-Bissau, our people and our institutions despite the multiple and complex problems that the world is facing. It is with great satisfaction that I highlight the indispensable role of the United Nations, through its representative in Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Modibo Tour\u00e9, whom I thank for his personal dedication to facilitating dialogue and seeking solutions, as well as the strengthened consolidation of the democratic rule of law in Guinea-Bissau.\nFinally, I wish the President of the Assembly continued success as he conducts the work of this seventy-first session of the General Assembly on behalf of the States and peoples of the world. May God bless us all.\n"

        "file_text": "We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and extend our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his commitment during the previous session and his strong efforts aimed at promoting transparency and efficiency within the United Nations system.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s general debate, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, is extremely important for all of us. The full and timely implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial in order to ensure progress and prosperity around the world, strengthen peace and make our planet a better place in which to live.\nBut peace and freedom are being tested today. We are witnessing the worst security situation since the end of the Second World War. National borders and international principles are being challenged. In many regions, war and terror prevail. States and institutions are disintegrating. The world is out of balance today. Terrorism is on the rise. No one is immune, and no one is safe. War zones have become breeding grounds for radical ideologies and launch pads for terrorist activities. Violations and abuses of human rights occur every day, and innocent women and children are the most affected. In these turbulent times, the number of crises around the world is at a record high. Protracted conflicts are causing so many humanitarian tragedies. Conflict resolution and reconciliation have become more challenging to achieve and sustain. It is very easy to occupy and destroy, but it is very difficult to rebuild and reconcile broken societies.\nEurope is a symbol of hope for millions of refugees. Inspired by our common values, we are determined to further strengthen our efforts to manage migration in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law. Countries that are close to the conflict zones, like Bulgaria, are facing an unprecedented challenge. We welcome the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) as a symbol of our joint effort to strengthen international cooperation so as to better protect and assist refugees.\nMigration should be managed through collective global efforts in a responsible way. Our specific focus should be on the protection of the human rights of migrants and refugees, especially the most vulnerable \u2014 women, children and persons with disabilities. At the same time, all migrants have the duty to comply with the laws of their countries of residence. Bulgaria welcomes the emphasis on global responsibility-sharing. That crucial element should guide us in building partnerships between the countries of origin, transit and destination and the entire international community.\nThe current global humanitarian crisis reminds us that we must tackle global issues in an inclusive and integrated manner, focusing on the root causes. It is also a crisis for children. We must hear their voice. We must recall that a child is first a child and then a refugee. The child is entitled to the full set of rights recognized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including family reunification.\nThe United Nations has a crucial role to play in addressing those challenges. Our crisis-management efforts require a holistic United Nations response, preventive diplomacy, mediation, peacebuilding, resilience and reconciliation. Bulgaria participates actively in the work of the Group of Friends of Mediation, which contributes to those efforts. We are committed to helping crisis-stricken countries recover. There is an old saying: \u201cPrevention is better than a cure.\u201d\nBulgaria is committed to the global efforts aimed at preventing and resolving ongoing conflicts. During our very successful chairmanship-in-office of the South-East European Cooperation Process, Bulgaria proposed concrete initiatives focused on enhancing security, stability, connectivity, reconciliation and sustainable development in the Balkans. Bulgaria plays an important role in strengthening the expertise of the European Union in the region and supports the Euro- Atlantic integration of the countries in the Western Balkans.\nThe European Union (EU) has unique significance and strong legitimacy because of the peaceful discussions it holds and its settlement of differences by consensus, because of its shared fundamental rights and rules, and because it has achieved an unprecedented level of integration and cooperation among its member States. Last week, Bulgaria very successfully hosted the annual meeting of the Arraiolos Group. Ten Presidents of EU member States exchanged ideas and shared a vision of how to rebuild trust in the European Union and bring lasting stability and prosperity to the Balkans. That served as an important recognition of the friendly, balanced and principled foreign policy that Bulgaria is conducting today.\nWe need to team up and develop common strategies, rather than build fortresses to defend short-sighted national interests. We have to engage leaders throughout the world and from all sectors of society, and not just acknowledge but resolve conflicts. We need prevention, and we need to be proactive so as to detect crises early and solve them. We need to empower diplomacy and promote principles, not interests and weapons. We need to reconfirm rather than renegotiate the principles of international order. As the Vice-President of the European Commission, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, stressed during the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, we need a step change in the way we address humanitarian crises by looking more rigorously into the root causes.\nBringing peace and reconciliation back to Syria can be achieved only through a Syrian-led political process that involves an inclusive transition that takes into account the aspirations of all parts of society. It is important to create favourable conditions enabling the resumption of the intra-Syrian peace talks as soon as possible.\nWe do not want to go back to the time when great Powers allocated their spheres of influence. We cannot once again allow political interests to divide and occupy the territory of sovereign States or create frozen conflicts.\nThe recent escalation of the conflict in Ukraine is a source of deep concern. Any attempt to destabilize Ukraine is unacceptable. Bulgaria strongly supports the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. My country renews its call for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements and reiterates its consistent policy of the non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.\nBulgaria supports the process of building a peaceful, stable and self-reliant Afghanistan. We will continue to contribute to the reconstruction and State-building process in Afghanistan through our participation in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission. We are contributing to the Afghanistan National Army Trust Fund, and we are assisting in building Afghanistan\u2019s administrative capacity through our official development assistance.\nThe Middle East peace process has reached a critical stage. New initiatives are needed to revive the two-State solution. Bulgaria welcomes the recent efforts in that direction, especially the Quartet report. We highly value and fully support the work of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, in his challenging mission. We reaffirm our position that the two-State solution is the realistic, just and lasting way to settle the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. A solution that could satisfy the aspirations of both sides can be achieved only through direct negotiations, with no conditions attached, and in conformity with all relevant international obligations.\nBulgaria supports the implementation of the agreement on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme, which is an important step forward in achieving stability in the region. We hope that all agreed measures will be fully implemented.\nThe fifth consecutive nuclear test carried out by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in September, is a direct violation of Security Council resolutions. We urge the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to suspend its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and to resume dialogue with the international community, including in the framework of the Six-Party Talks.\nTerrorism and violent extremism are an alarming threat to peace and security. It is a source of grave concern that such acts have increased dramatically. We cannot and should not accept that this is the new normal. Every effort must be made to eradicate terrorism and violent extremism. Bulgaria is a proud member of the international Anti-Terrorism Coalition.\nThe United Nations has an important role to play in managing and coordinating comprehensive counter- terrorism actions across the world. The relevant Security Council resolutions and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy serve as a good basis for international cooperation. Bulgaria supports the Secretary-General\u2019s review of the United Nations counter-terrorism architecture.\nThe prevention of radicalization is an essential part of the response. Bulgaria has adopted the required domestic legislation and has built the necessary institutional capacity. Education, the protection of cultural heritage and the protection of human rights will help us deal with the reasons that lead individuals to feel forced to join violent extremist groups. The role of UNESCO in those efforts is crucial. We commend the dedicated work and invaluable contribution of Ms. Irina Bokova and her leadership in promoting education and intercultural dialogue globally. Her outstanding performance and strong commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations are fundamental for achieving sustainable progress and long-lasting results.\nWe made history with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Now it is time for their implementation. It is up to all of us to adapt our national strategies and deliver on those commitments. As President of Bulgaria, I was so proud to be among the first to sign the historic Paris Agreement during the high-level ceremony at the Secretariat in New York. My country supports the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement. I have the pleasure to announce that the Bulgarian Government has already initiated its domestic ratification procedure.\nMy country is elaborating its national programme for development, Bulgaria 2030, by actively engaging civil society, young people, the private sector and media. We are focusing on education, high-tech and innovation to build a green and energy-efficient economy. To that end, we are educating young Bulgarians on the importance of sustainability. Bulgarian schools, in partnership with UNICEF, have introduced special programmes to teach children about the SDGs.\nPeace is not a given, and it is up to all of us to protect it. And peace is not just the absence of war. Peace is human rights. Peace is the rule of law. Promoting human rights is a core purpose of the United Nations and defines its identity. Bulgaria has been strongly advocating for strengthening the human rights pillar of the United Nations. Bulgaria is determined to further contribute to promoting human rights as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021, and we rely on our partners\u2019 valuable support for our candidacy.\nBulgaria attaches great importance to the protection of children and the promotion of their rights. As Co-Chair of the Group of Friends on Children and SDGs, Bulgaria has been strongly advocating for the integration of children\u2019s human rights in all major intergovernmental processes at the United Nations. It is our firm conviction that children should be at the heart of global action. We made children\u2019s rights a strategic priority for the Council of Europe during our chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers, and we are so proud to see the adoption of the Sofia Strategy for the Rights of the Child and the full support of all 47 member States. I commend the excellent work of the previous Bulgarian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Stefan Tafrov, his vice-presidency of the UNICEF Executive Board and his dedication to the cause of children and human rights.\nIn the past few decades, the United Nations has made significant progress in advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Those efforts should continue and be further strengthened. Bulgaria is actively engaged at all levels in promoting gender equality, as well as in ending gender-based discrimination and all forms of violence against women and girls. My country strongly supports the UN-Women Planet 50-50 campaign for achieving gender equality by 2030. Women in Bulgaria enjoy full participation in all areas of life. In our Government, two of three deputy prime ministers and half of the ministers are women. Two thirds of the magistrates at all levels are women. Bulgaria ranks third in the EU in terms of women\u2019s participation in the executive boards of large companies.\nIn recent years, there has been growing support in the international community for ensuring equal opportunities for women and men in gaining access to senior decision-making positions, including the post of Secretary-General. The relevant resolution 69/321 stresses the need to ensure equal and fair distribution based on gender and geographical balance, while meeting the highest possible requirements, in the appointment of the Secretary-General. After eight male Secretaries-General, the time has come for a capable and respectable woman from Eastern Europe to lead the United Nations. Bulgaria has a very strong candidate, a true leader with extensive experience in international relations and excellent management skills, a candidate who deserves Member States\u2019 trust and support.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proud and proactive member at the very heart of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations was formed because leaders across the world knew that they could deliver security for their citizens at home only if they could cooperate as a community of nations to deliver security across the globe. Some of the threats that we face together today are familiar to those founding leaders: war, political instability, abuses of human rights and poverty. Others are new: global terrorism, climate change and unprecedented mass movements of people.\nWe gather here today because we know that such challenges do not respect the borders of our individual nations and that only by working together shall we overcome them. As a new Prime Minister to the United Kingdom, my pledge to the United Nations is simple. The United Kingdom will be a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally, true to the universal values that we share together. We will continue to honour our commitment to spend 0.7 of our gross national income on development, building on the achievements that we have already made to reduce poverty, deal with instability and increase prosperity the world over, and we will drive forward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure that all girls get the education they deserve and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict. We will continue to be a steadfast permanent member of the Security Council, meeting our NATO commitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence and making a leading contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, where we have doubled our commitment, including new deployments to Somalia and South Sudan.\nWe will continue to stand up for the rules-based international system and for international law, and I join other leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday. We will continue to play our part in the international effort against climate change, and, in a demonstration of our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Kingdom will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris Agreement and complete these before the end of the year. And we will continue to strengthen our existing partnerships, from the United Nations to the Commonwealth and to NATO, seeking to resolve conflict in countries across the world, from Colombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen.\nBut we must never forget that we stand here at the United Nations as servants of the men and women that we represent back at home. As we do so, we must recognize that for too many of these men and women, the increasing pace of globalization has left them feeling left behind. The challenge for those of us in this Hall is to ensure that our Governments and our global institutions such as the United Nations remain responsive to the people we serve, and that we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the twenty-first century and of ensuring that they do not become irrelevant.\nSo when it comes the big security and human rights challenges of our time, we need this, our United Nations, to forge a bold new multilateralism, because, as we have seen even in the past week, no country is untouched by the threat of global terrorism, and when extremists anywhere in the world can transmit their poisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of people vulnerable to radicalization, we need not just work together to prevent conflict and instability in nation States, but to act globally to disrupt the networks that terrorist groups use to finance operations and recruit to their ranks.\nWhen we see the mass displacement of people on a scale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure that we are implementing the policies that are fit for the challenges we face today. And when criminal gangs do not respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow citizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot let those borders act as a barrier to bringing such criminals to justice.\nIn each of these areas, it is the convening power of our United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity to respond. But we can do so only if we modernize and adapt to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nAs a United Nations we have shown how we can work together to reduce the threat of international terrorism by preventing conflict and instability from developing. For example, as a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain has played a leading role in the fight against Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with huge support from across the region and, critically, the commitment of Somalis themselves, Al-Shabaab has been driven from all the major cities it used to control.\nIt is vital that as an international community we continue to support countries in the region that are contributing thousands of troops, and that we continue to build the capacity of Somali security forces. That is why the United Kingdom is now going to increase further our security support, and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017, to maintain this vital momentum. Missions like this must remain central to the work of the United Nations, but on their own they are not enough, because the terrorist threats we face today do not come from one country but rather exist in a different space. The global networks they exploit require a different kind of global response.\nThese organizations are using our own modern banking networks against us. We therefore need to look at our regulations and information-sharing and use our technological capabilities to get ahead of them. They are targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one country can keep its citizens safe when they are flying between multiple jurisdictions. That is why this week the United Nations will vote on a United Kingdom- led draft resolution on aviation security so that every country implements the standards we need to ensure that no country is the weak link.\nThey are exploiting the Internet and social media to spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their cause all over the world. We therefore need to tackle this ideology head-on. That is why the United Kingdom has championed the work that the Secretary-General has led to develop a strategy for preventing violent extremism. Now, as an international community, we must work together to adopt and implement the most comprehensive national action plans to tackle both the causes and the symptoms of all extremism. It is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism \u2014 violent extremism and non-violent extremism, Islamist and neo-Nazi, hate and fear in all their forms.\nJust as we need the United Nations to modernize to meet the challenges of terrorism in the twenty-first century, so too must we adapt if we are to fashion a truly global response to the mass movements of people across the world and its implications for security and human rights. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol must remain the bedrock of our response, but the context in which they must be applied has dramatically changed.\nAcross the world today, there are 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced. That is the equivalent of the entire population of the United Kingdom. It is an unprecedented figure, one that has almost doubled in a decade. And yet United Nations appeals are underfunded, host countries are not getting enough support and refugees are not getting the aid, education and economic opportunities they need. We must do more. As the second-largest bilateral provider of assistance, the United Kingdom remains fully committed to playing a leading role.\nIn the past five years, the United Kingdom has invested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, saving millions of lives every year. The London Conference on Syria in February raised $12 billion in pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day in response to a humanitarian crisis. And that money is being used to combine both urgent humanitarian assistance and vital economic development, benefiting both refugees and the communities and countries hosting them. Clearly, we need to continue our efforts to bring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter in Syria and to get aid through to those who need it.\nWhile these efforts continue inside Syria, we also need new efforts to support refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, including through education and opportunities to work. These efforts are complemented by loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. Through our trading relationships and direct engagement with businesses, we are mobilizing the private sector to create new jobs in the region for everyone. While there is more to be done, it is this approach to financing both humanitarian support and economic development that I will be championing when I announce a further United Kingdom financial contribution at President Obama\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit on the global refugee crisis later today.\nBut in addition to refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing an unprecedented movement of people in search of greater economic opportunities through the same unmanaged channels. That affects all of us, and it is the responsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore the challenge or allow it to continue unmanaged. We need to do better \u2014 for the countries people leave, for the countries they move through, for the countries they try to get to \u2014 and most of all, better for the migrants and refugees themselves.\nDespite the huge increase in international efforts, more migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys across borders this year than any other. I believe we have to use the opportunity afforded by this session of the General Assembly for an honest global debate to address this global challenge.\nIn doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing wrong with the desire to migrate for a better life and that controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings benefits to our economies. But countries have to be able to exercise control over their borders. The failure to do so erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, damages economies and reduces the resources for those who genuinely need protection and whose rights under the Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled. I believe there are three fundamental principles that we now need to establish at the heart of a new approach to managing migration that is in the interests of all those involved.\nFirst of all, we must help ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. The current trend of onward movements, where refugees reach a safe country but then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger. We must therefore all do more to support countries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the necessary protection and assistance for refugees safely and swiftly and to help countries adapt to the huge economic impact that refugees can have \u2014 including on their existing population.\nAs we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, when the right assistance is provided, solutions that provide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and opportunities for those hosting them, can be found. This is also good for the refugees and the countries they come from \u2014 because the closer they stay to home, the easier it will be for them to return and rebuild after the conflict.\nSecondly, we need to improve the ways we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants. I believe we must ensure that the existing Convention and Protocol are properly applied to provide protection to refugees and reduce the incentives for economic migrants to use illegal routes. This in turn will help us target support for those refugees who need it most and retain the support of our populations for doing so.\nThirdly, we need a better overall approach to managing economic migration \u2014 one that recognizes that all countries have the right to control their borders \u2014 and that we must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere. By ensuring a managed and controlled international migration response while simultaneously investing to tackle the underlying drivers of displacement and migration at source, we can reject isolationism and xenophobia, thereby achieving better outcomes for all of our citizens, particularly for the most vulnerable.\nFinally, as we gather here today to bring the founding values of the United Nations to bear on some of the most pressing global problems, the likes of which we have never seen before, we must also face up to the fact that some of the worst human rights abuses, which we thought we had consigned to the history books, have re-emerged in new, pernicious forms. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the General Assembly, stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one should be held in slavery and servitude and that slavery and the slave trade should be prohibited in all their forms. Yet, nearly 70 years on, we are presented with a new form of slavery \u2014 modern slavery. Organized crime groups, which are largely behind this modern slavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and children into extreme forms of exploitation. Trafficked and sold across borders, victims are forced into living the kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much for our imagination.\nSuch criminals have global networks to help them make money out of some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions, under the constant shadow of violence and forced into sex and labour exploitation. If we are going to succeed in stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality of what were are dealing with. These organized- crime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. They often use the Internet and modern technology to recruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all the while staying ahead of legal systems that are often constrained by traditional geographical boundaries.\nWe must therefore take action. We must use our international law-enforcement networks to track down these criminals wherever they are in the world and put them behind bars, where they belong. We need to be smarter and even more coordinated than the criminal gangs in our efforts to stop them. In the United Kingdom, I am setting up the first-ever Government task force for modern slavery, bringing together every relevant department to coordinate and drive all our efforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation. We are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated fund focused on high-risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the United Kingdom. Yesterday, I committed the first \u00a35 million from that fund to work in Nigeria, to reduce the vulnerability of potential victims and step up the fight against those who seek to profit from this crime.\nBut if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much further. Security relationships have developed between many countries for dealing with such issues as counter- terrorism, cybersecurity, drug trafficking and wider intelligence-sharing, but we do not have a similar relationship for the fight against modern slavery. We therefore need our law-enforcement agencies to work together, with joint investigation teams working across multiple countries. Victims will find freedom only if we cultivate a radically new, global and coordinated approach to defeating this vile crime. Together, we must work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and values that have defined our United Nations from its inception. Together, we must work tirelessly to restore these freedoms and values to the lives of the men, women and children who are exploited for profit and held captive with little or no chance of escape.\nFrom the Declaration of St. James\u2019s Palace and the Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt to the first meeting of the General Assembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom has always been an outward-looking, global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our peoples. And that is how we will remain. For when the British people voted to leave the European Union, they did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world. Faced with challenges like migration, a desire for greater control of their country and a mounting sense that globalization is leaving working people behind, they demanded a politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them.\nBut that action must be more global, not less, because the biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not recognize or respect international borders. And if we focus only on what we do at home, the job is barely half done. This is not the time to turn away from our United Nations. It is the time to turn towards it. Only we, as members of this community of nations, can act to ensure that this great institution becomes as relevant for our future as it has been in our past.\nLet us therefore come together, true to our founding values but responsive to the challenges of today, and let us work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more humane world for generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "Costa Rica congratulates Mr. Thomson on his election as leader of the General Assembly and welcomes the priorities that he has set for his term of office. The President can count on our full support for their implementation. Costa Rica also thanks the Secretary-General for his leadership and, in particular, his contribution to the cause of peace and sustainable development.\nWe are coming to the end of 2016, having achieved little progress in addressing the crisis of refugees and migrants \u2014 the worst such crisis since the Second World War. Costa Rica reiterates the urgency of providing assistance and the need to ensure the protection of and respect for the human rights of people who have been forced to leave their homes in search of safe havens for themselves and their families, as a result of armed conflict, violence, natural disasters or the effects of climate change that threaten their access to the most basic means of survival. We are failing to fulfil our commitment to leave no one behind.\nMass media and the international community have paid little attention to the tragedy of thousands of migrants travelling through Latin America from south to north. For Costa Rica, from April to September alone 9,487 irregular migrants have crossed our borders, and we have granted refugee status to a total of 215 people during the first half of 2016 alone. Our country has been a crossroads for thousands of migrants: Cubans, Haitians, Central Americans, Asians and Africans.\nClearly, the problem is global and requires joint solutions, solidarity, shared responsibility and comprehensive approaches. With regard to migration and refugee crises, we must not consider only large movements, as these only deal with very specific experiences, and leave out any discussion on the constant flow of migration throughout the rest of the world. Such movement takes place outside of the confines of the law. It is a phenomenon that is fuelled by inequality, poverty and structural causes resulting from conflict and is fostered by the activities of international organized crime networks.\nAs a country of origin, transit and destination for migrants, Costa Rica has criminalized their trafficking under the law against trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants adopted in 2012. That legal framework also guides the design and implementation of our national policy to address the crime of migrant smuggling from a gender perspective. The policy is based on the care and protection of victims, prevention, law enforcement, information gathering, analysis and research, and institutional coordination.\nIn our experience, faced with flows of migrants and the need for humanitarian aid, we must highlight the ongoing role played by civil society organizations as a support network for migrants and their families on the move, in addition to their enormous capacity to document the situation on the ground and see to and deal with violations of human rights of smuggled migrants. Communities that have welcomed these migrants have shown their profound solidarity with those in need.\nThe complex situation concerning the wave of migrants will only be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Floods, droughts and the rise in sea level will force people to pick up and move within their country and abroad.\nSuch challenges call on us to virtuously manage the entire ecosystem of human mobility through a dialogue on processes, actors, mechanisms and organizations. Resources must be efficiently used, and there must be better coordination between humanitarian and development actors. That does not mean that development resources must be redirected to humanitarian assistance. That would create a vicious circle, thereby neglecting investment in the root causes of such movements.\nWe will not tire of repeating and insisting on the need to address the specific impacts that migration has on women and the need to adapt public policies to address those particularities. We will continue to raise our voice to call for action to combat gender-based and sexual violence.\nIf we are feigning loyalty to laws and institutions, we had better stop. If we believe that humankind can survive by remaining on this path and adhering to pretences as usual, we will only be selfishly and short- sightedly digging our own grave. We should remember that it is not because of mere altruism but the starkest realities that we have chosen to abide by a global order, subject to institutions and universal principles of self- regulation. The escalation of tensions, conflicts and the use of force suit no one but a few merchants of suffering and death. The national interest of all States is to strengthen the international system and the United Nations, which is at the centre of that effort.\nThe philosopher and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer said,\n\u201cTo the question whether I am a pessimist or an optimist, I answer that my knowledge is pessimistic, but my willing and hoping are optimistic\u201d.\nToday there are realities and actions that fill me with optimism because change is taking place in the world. I wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his invitation to be co-facilitator, along with my colleague Simona Scarpaleggia, Chief Executive Officer of IKEA Switzerland, of the High-Level Panel on Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment. The hard work of the Panel has already resulted constructively in a preliminary report. I want to share several of its conclusions with the Assembly.\nSimona Scarpaleggia said at the Panel,\n\u201cI firmly believe that there is huge potential that could be unlocked simply by valuing and empowering women. The energy, the power and creativity of women are badly needed \u2014 not only to make this world a better place, but to enable it to survive in the years to come.\u201d\nThe lessons are many, but first it is necessary to recall some facts, some of which might seem obvious and others that might surprise. The vast majority of women in the world work. They work in the informal, public and private sectors as business women, domestic workers, and unremunerated workers. But women have half as many possibilities as men in securing full-time paid work. It is estimated that there are 1.27 billion women worldwide in paid jobs compared with 2 billion men. We are talking about a difference of more than 700 million women who do not have the same opportunities as men. Women undertake unpaid work three times as often as men and handle most of the caregiving work. The deep and unfortunate impact of this situation is reflected in the fact that it is estimated that the value of unpaid care work is equivalent to $10 billion, or 13 per cent of world gross domestic product.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are interconnected and interdependent. The Panel emphasized the multiple relationships that exist between the targets set out in Goal 5, on gender equality and the empowerment of women, and Goal 8, to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all, men and women alike. The relationship between this debate and Goal 10 is clear: the goal is to reduce inequality within and among countries. I am convinced that the economic empowerment of women should be viewed not only as a goal in itself but as a means for the implementation of the other targets and Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda.\nThe Panel proposes seven principles and seven guiding actions. As basic principles, we assume that no woman should be left behind and that nothing should be done for women without the participation of women, and that we should focus equally on rights and profits. Empowerment is not only the right thing to do; it is the intelligent road map towards human development, growth and business promotion. We must also address the root causes of economic gender inequality based on gender inequalities in society, respect internationally agreed standards, and, finally, recognize the need to work in partnerships, with global compliance in all countries.\nTo achieve the global empowerment of women, the Panel recommends the following measures.\nFirst, we must end stereotypes and transform and challenge the rules that limit women\u2019s access to work or devalue their work. Changing those rules must be a priority in order to expand women\u2019s economic opportunities within the framework of the 2030 Agenda.\nWe must level the playing field for women, guarantee employment and social protection, and reform discriminatory laws and regulations. A total of 155 countries worldwide have at least one law that prevents women from becoming involved in economic activities. This must be changed; it would contribute greatly to economic growth, and it is a simple step that all Governments can take.\nFinally, as a social co-responsibility, we must invest in care, recognizing, reducing and redistributing unpaid work in this field. We must ensure decent working conditions for domestic workers. One of the first steps to achieve this is to ratify International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 189. I urge those countries that have not yet done so to take that step.\nWe must guarantee the an adequate distribution of digital, financial and physical goods. This is also important. We need Governments, the private sector and civil society to take action so as to ensure that trends and innovations in digital technologies and finance, as well as legal reforms in the field of tenancy and land ownership, expand women\u2019s opportunities.\nWe must change our culture and the way we do business in order to create opportunities for women. As a minimum, businesses should follow ILO conventions along with national legislation regarding gender equality in order to eliminate discriminatory practices.\nWe must create opportunities, with Governments improving practices in the public sector both as an employer and as a supplier of goods and services. We must establish, implement and promote public policies that benefit women living in poverty and vulnerability as well as macroeconomic policies that guarantee their rights and generate sustainable and inclusive work.\nWomen\u2019s voices must be heard, encouraging a greater participation in leadership and business and political decision-making posts. In order to translate such measures into reality, it is imperative that we improve data collection relating to the economic empowerment of women. The ILO, along with many other United Nations agencies, development banks and various countries and organizations, has been making considerable efforts to create new methodologies and measurements with respect to the widest variety of variables pertaining to the economic empowerment of women.\nThe Heads of State and Government who are listening today should know that the most important aspect of the work of the Panel, which is scheduled to issue a second report next year, relates to everything that we are able to accomplish in our own countries as a result of its findings, good practices, principles and recommendations. We invite those States capable of implementing the Panel\u2019s recommendations to do so and to become laboratories instrumental in their implementation. A call to action is imperative. There must be greater commitment on the part of all to achieve this objective.\nWe know that the world has many crises to deal with, but we can and must promote and ensure changes that will transform the lives of millions of women and girls. This is an imperative call to action. I am certain that this will benefit not only women, but also our societies at large. This is a step we must take in order to achieve equality in other aspects of relationships between men and women. This is the best path for our planet; together, humankind can effectively adopt new models of sustainable development that allow us to survive as a species.\nIt fills us with immense pride that the Paris Agreement negotiations were led by a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change until early July, a woman with immense diplomatic capabilities who showed us that when we work together, with commitment and a focus on the common good, we can restore hope and work towards a better world.\nThe Paris Agreement must enter into force immediately, and we have an obligation to increase our ambitions with time. That is why Costa Rica has made every effort to complete its domestic approval process and will soon join the list of countries that have ratified it.\nWe therefore aspire to become a laboratory for the deep decarbonization of the world economy and a green hub for management, innovation and the transfer of knowledge, with early action built upon existing achievements. With our planned nationally determined contribution, we will work to achieve our national aspiration to steer the economy towards carbon neutrality by 2021, as part and parcel of pre- 2020 voluntary actions, and we have strengthened our long-term commitment to the deep decarbonization of the economy. The compensatory effects of our forests are accompanied by emissions reductions in critical sectors such as transport, livestock and waste. We have set an absolute emissions limit for 2030, which is equivalent to a 25 per cent reduction in emissions compared with 2012.\nOur aspirations also include the promotion of our social inclusion and development policies so that our focus can go beyond the traditional silo-based approach. We are moving towards an integral development model based on multidimensional benchmarks that go far beyond the entry requirement. For that reason, on 9 September the heads of the three State branches and representatives of local governments, the private sector, social and religious organizations and academia gathered to sign the national pact to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.\nOur planet needs our care, and this care must be all-encompassing. Costa Rica is fully committed to processes that, within the framework of the United Nations, seek to protect oceans and marine resources, in particular through the elaboration of a new international agreement for the protection of the more than 60 per cent of marine biodiversity that is located in international areas, in keeping with Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda.\nCosta Rica continues to be deeply shocked by the terrorist attacks that, unfortunately, as we know, occur somewhere in the world practically every week of the year. We would like once again to express our absolute, unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in every all its forms and manifestations, no matter who commits it or where it happens or with whatever goal in mind, as well as to stress the need to bring to justice those who commit such acts.\nThe fight against terrorism must be framed in strict observance of international law, including human rights law, international humanitarian law and the international law on refugees. In that context, we think that this is the right time to make a respectful request to countries that have not yet done so to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty without further delay. The diversion of arms to extremist groups could be substantially reduced if more States were to implement the provisions set forth in that multilateral, legally binding instrument.\nCosta Rica has followed with concern the constant launches of missiles and the carrying out of nuclear exercises by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the most recent one being on 9 September. In addition to voicing our strongest condemnation and rejection of such actions, which represent a serious threat to peace, stability and regional and international security, we must demand that North Korea cease such punishable acts, which unequivocally violate relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including the most recent one on the subject, resolution 2270 (2016).\nCosta Rica also wishes to stress the importance of fighting impunity for criminal atrocities. Prosecution for such crimes must be promoted comprehensively and at the highest level. Costa Rica welcomes the initiatives aimed at promoting a code of conduct restricting the use of the veto in the Security Council in cases of outrageous crimes. Costa Rica reiterates its call to Member States to adopt the code of conduct put forth by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group.\nLikewise, Costa Rica welcomes the efforts oriented towards the full establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Cuba, as well as the measures announced by the senior authorities of those two friendly countries concerning political dialogue and openness. In that spirit, we reiterate our support for the lifting of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in accordance with the systematic, almost unanimous, demands of the international community to that end.\nCosta Rica welcomes the signing of the peace agreements in Colombia and the ceasefire declaration of last August. Not only does that bring an end to the oldest armed conflict in the region, but it also contributes to wholly converting Latin America and the Caribbean into a region of peace. We trust that the agreement will allow the Government and our Colombian brothers and sisters to plan their future development along a peaceful path.\nWe would like to stress that it is the General Assembly that has the power to define the term of office of the next Secretary-General through the appointment resolution. We will continue to advocate that the term be a single period of seven years without the possibility of re-election, as we are convinced that that would facilitate the exercise of leadership free from the coordination required to set in motion a selection process designed to secure a second term. It is fundamental to Costa Rica that there be a democratization of the selection process for the Secretary-General. Therefore, the Security Council\u2019s endorsement of more than one candidate increases the inclusiveness, transparency and, most important, the legitimacy of the process by requiring a vote.\nWe have advocated, and will continue to advocate, that a woman should occupy the position of Secretary- General for the first time in history. We have reached a new milestone in history by having six extraordinary women, including a Costa Rican, as candidates for the position of Secretary-General. The transformation demanded by people all over the world requires new sensibilities and forms of exercising leadership.\nMy goal is that my daughter In\u00e9s, who is 10 years old now, will be able to tell her descendants of a strange former era, when women did not earn as much as men for the same work, when they were not equal owners of the means of production, when the care of children was a chore largely reserved for women and when their sexual and reproductive rights were not safeguarded. That strange era is the one that we must leave behind, in the same way that we slowly leave behind other scourges such as slavery, discrimination in any of its many forms, and consumption and wars as the basis for our economy, which are destroying our shared home, Mother Earth.\nWe can overcome hate, violence and inequality. We can achieve peace. We can trace the path to development and human progress. We just need to believe that it is possible, and that making it happen is in our hands.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I would like to join all those who have preceded me at this rostrum in offering you my sincere and warm congratulations on your election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We believe that your outstanding knowledge of the international scene and excellent personal qualities will ensure the success of our work. And I would be remiss in this pleasant duty if I did not also pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his vision and leadership and for all the work that he has done to strengthen the role of the Organization during his two terms.\nToday, I am addressing the Assembly for the first time since my accession to the presidency of my country in November 2015. After going through a profound political crisis arising from its denial of certain basic democratic principles, Burkina Faso has returned to the core values underpinning democracy and the rule of law. The people of Burkina Faso, and especially our young people, have displayed great maturity and given proof, if any were needed, that nothing and no one can indefinitely suppress the desire for justice and freedom of a knowledgeable people who jealously guard their rights and dignity.\nThis is where I should express our deep appreciation to the United Nations and the international community in general, which rallied to our side throughout our fight. Their support, manifested in many ways, helped us to definitively restore normal constitutional order and to organize democratic, free and transparent presidential, legislative and local elections. My presence in this Hall today symbolizes, therefore, the restoration of those rights and the recovery of our freedom. From now on, Burkina Faso is resolutely committed to consolidating its democratic process, supported by its firm commitment to achieving national reconciliation and establishing a genuine and permanent political dialogue.\nSustainable development has never figured as prominently on the agenda of the international community\u2019s priorities as it does now. Above all, our commitment to eradicating poverty and fighting inequality has never been stronger. We should therefore welcome the relevance of the theme of this year\u2019s session, which calls on us to give the push needed to transform our world through our effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals that we unanimously adopted last year, while ensuring, as the Secretary- General has so often urged us, that we leave no one behind.\nFor its part, and in order to give true meaning to the struggle that our people has waged for freedom and progress from its inception and in accordance with its mandate, the Government of Burkina Faso has committed to formulating a national economic and social development plan for the period from 2016 to 2020. Based directly on our people\u2019s aspirations, the plan \u2014 which reflects the broad guidelines of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 \u2014 will be presented to our technical and financial partners at a donors\u2019 round table to be held in Paris on 7 and 8 December. We know that we can count on the active solidarity of all concerned, whose support of the efforts of the Government of Burkina Faso will enable us to lay the foundations for the genuinely sustainable development that can ensure our country\u2019s peace, security, safety and stability.\nThe world today is facing formidable challenges that demand that we strengthen our collective action and intensify our joint efforts within the framework of our Organization. International terrorism and violent extremism have emerged as the major threats of our time. The unprecedentedly violent terrorist attacks that are being perpetrated without discrimination every day, all over the world, illustrate to perfection the reach of what is now a global scourge. As victims of it ourselves, we can appreciate its scope. In that regard, I would like to pay tribute to the memory of every victim of those vile acts and to reiterate the sympathy and solidarity of the people of Burkina Faso with all the peoples and countries that they have touched.\nWe must realize that the effectiveness of our fight will depend on our ability to launch partnerships, pool our efforts and exchange information within the framework of a coherent, solid global coalition. The action that we are taking in the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) is part of that effort and should be supported.\nBurkina Faso welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s report on his Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674), presented to the Assembly on 15 January, and calls for a draft comprehensive convention on terrorism to be finalized and adopted as soon as possible.\nOur struggle will bear fruit only when we succeed in destroying the terrorists\u2019 rearguard and, especially, their sources of supply, and when we commit to addressing the causes of all such types of extremism, which include extreme poverty, injustice, inequality, intolerance and exclusion.\nIn that connection, how can we not think of the thousands of migrants and displaced people risking their lives every day in search of a better tomorrow, and turning the seas and oceans into open-air cemeteries? That is why we welcome the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), which embodies our shared desire to find ways and means to arrive at a global pact for more effective and humane management of the issue of the mass displacement of refugees and migrants. We are more than ever convinced that refugees and migrants should no longer be seen as a threat but rather as an opportunity, not just for themselves but also for their host countries and countries of origin, helping to bring peoples and nations closer together.\nClimate change is a major concern for us. Burkina Faso therefore welcomes the adoption of the Paris Agreement and calls for its ratification by all stakeholders. We hope that that new environmental pact will result in the developed countries significantly reducing their carbon emission levels and making good on their financial pledges so as to strengthen developing countries\u2019 resilience in the face of climate-related disasters. The 2016 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Marrakesh in November, will be a milestone in that regard. Similarly, I also welcomed the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in 2015, and the Global Humanitarian Summit, held in May of this year in Istanbul, which enabled us to reiterate our commitments to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe all know that peace, security and development are inseparable. That is why Africa has thrown itself into efforts to seek peace and strengthen democracy. Burkina Faso therefore welcomes the significant progress recently made on our continent, including the free and transparent elections in several countries. While there is no doubt that tensions and crises still persist, we are confident that the political stakeholders in the countries concerned will be able to consolidate peace, stability and security and promote sustainable development.\nThe security situation in northern Mali, however, remains a source of great concern that deserves the international community\u2019s full attention, both on the importance of operationalizing the new mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali as soon as possible and on giving serious support to subregional initiatives, including the operationalization of the G-5 Sahel\u2019s rapid response force. The international community should also support the Government of Mali\u2019s establishment of the genuine drivers of development in the region. The same attention should be given to South Sudan and Somalia, so that they can finally turn the page on the violence, conflicts and crises that have plagued their institutional underpinnings and development efforts. Based on its respect for the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, Burkina Faso reiterates its call for a negotiated political solution to the question of Western Sahara.\nThe world will never be at peace as long as the Middle East is not at peace. We call for a peaceful, just and equitable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in harmony, within secure and recognized borders. We welcomed the efforts of the peace conference for Israel and Palestine organized by France in June. With regard to Syria, Iraq and Yemen, we urge the entire international community to commit to the quest for genuine peace, which must be based on respect for international law, so that the enormous potential of those countries can be harnessed to contribute to the welfare of their peoples and their region.\nBurkina Faso also welcomes the gradual easing of relations between Cuba and the United States of America, and hopes that the process will culminate in definitive normalization and an end to the economic, financial and trade embargo on Cuba.\nRegarding another significant indicator of the world\u2019s health, I would like to reiterate the importance of ensuring that the fight against HIV/AIDS continues to be active, as the risks of its resurgence, despite the progress that has been made, are enormous, owing to the rapid increase in young people as a percentage of the population. Burkina Faso remains determined to put an end to that scourge by 2030. On 13 July, we adopted a national strategic framework for combating HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections in order to focus our synergies and efforts on fighting sexually transmitted diseases for the period from 2016 to 2020. We welcome the holding of successive sessions of the high-level meeting on the subject, as well as the 21st International AIDS Conference, held in Durban in July. It is now up to the international community to take ownership of the conclusions of those forums in order to be able to bequeath to future generations a world free of that pandemic.\nRegarding the issue of general disarmament, we must continue our efforts to build trust among our States. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses a real threat to peace and security and the development of States, particularly in Africa. That threat would be significantly reduced by the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty. Burkina Faso firmly supports the actions of the United Nations aimed at achieving general and complete disarmament, in terms of both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons.\nAfter the 71 years of its existence, it is vital that we undertake responsible and balanced reform of the United Nations if we are to achieve an international order that is more just, equitable and viable, based on a dialogue between peoples and civilizations and a culture of sharing and solidarity. Where reform of the Security Council specifically is concerned, Burkina Faso reiterates its commitment to and support of the African position, whose sole objective is to repair a historical injustice done to Africa.\nThis year we have the weighty responsibility of appointing a new Secretary-General of our Organization. While we welcome the efforts of the President to contribute to the transparency of the selection process, Burkina Faso urges all Member States to also offer their help and support to whomever is charged with this globally unique position, so that he or she can put his or her skills and leadership to work in the exclusive service of peace, justice and development for all. I wish all of us success in our work.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, on his election and commend him for the theme chosen for the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. Following the success a year ago of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, we need a universal push to transform our world. The General Assembly may rest assured that it can count on Portugal\u2019s committed contribution. I would also like to extend Portugal\u2019s recognition to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his capacity for dialogue, vision for the future and commitment to promoting a more efficient United Nations.\nIn an increasingly complex world, the Organization will always be an irreplaceable institution in the eyes of its Members. I therefore reiterate Portugal\u2019s unwavering and enduring commitment to the United Nations, the Charter and its guiding purposes and principles, as well as its strict respect for international law. The historic agreements, on the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change, reached in 2015 and 2016, respectively, the World Humanitarian Summit and the General Assembly special session on the world drug problem were all major achievements that exemplified effective, United Nations-centred multilateralism.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s special session on the world drug problem, held in April, was an important step forward taken by the international community to realize an integrated and humanist vision. Having held such a vision for over a decade, Portugal regards it as the necessary and successful global response. In this as in other domains, we must now make additional efforts and focus primarily on prevention.\nA culture of prevention should also be developed in the area of maintaining peace and security by promoting sustainable development and respect for human rights, with the ultimate aim of safeguarding human dignity, relieving suffering and ending poverty. To this end, I would like to highlight this year\u2019s review of the United Nations peace and security architecture, including the women and peace and security dimension. It provided an opportunity to reinforce United Nations preventive capabilities. For example, strengthening preventive action in Africa is essential to prevent many of the crises the continent is facing from developing, while respecting African ownership of the processes. Portugal will continue to contribute to this effort, in particular by deploying military contingents in such peacekeeping operations as the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.\nIt is also worth noting our commitment to promoting maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea, as can be seen in our current presidency of the Group of Seven Group of Friends of the Gulf of Guinea. We continue to support Guinea-Bissau and we are confident that constructive political dialogue will be undertaken to reach a sustainable solution within the constitutional framework in order to meet the legitimate aspirations of the Guinean people. We also believe that a meeting of the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau needs to be held with the utmost urgency in order to reassert the international community\u2019s consensus in favour of long-awaited structural reforms.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, we welcomed the talks held in Havana, which led to a peace agreement for Colombia, one of Portugal\u2019s partners at Ibero- American summits. That agreement paves the way for national reconciliation among all Colombians, which will allow them to live together in peace and in respect for the rule of law and the views of others. We will participate in the peacekeeping process by contributing personnel to the prospective United Nations mission, as well as financially through the European Union Trust Fund for Colombia.\nIt is the Israeli-Palestinian issue, however, that demonstrates that there is still a way to go in terms of peacebuilding. That is why I would reiterate Portugal\u2019s support for international efforts aimed at bringing about the resumption of peace talks. We hope that United Nations resolutions can provide a basis for a sustainable solution to the conflict with a view to ensuring the existence of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side with the State of Israel, whose legitimate security aspirations must be guaranteed.\nFurthermore, we are also very concerned about the recent escalation of threats to security and stability on the Korean peninsula, which we condemn. We call for resumed collaboration among neighbours and the international community aimed at having the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea suspend its nuclear programme.\nFrom the subway station in Brussels to Mogadishu airport, from a club in Orlando to Quetta hospital in Pakistan, the pure inhumanity of these terrorist attacks is not just against the targeted countries and the victims; rather, it is against all those who endorse the principles and values of the United Nations Charter \u2014 the 193 States gathered here today \u2014 and it is against humankind as a whole. Terrorism cannot be tolerated. The United Nations, through its mandate from the international community, has the lawful right and the moral duty to end this scourge, and specifically one of its major proponents, Da\u2019esh. We shall not give in to fear, nor shall we forfeit our values or principles, particularly with regard to human rights. It is through the values of peace, tolerance, human dignity and solidarity that we should fight radicalization and violent extremism, as well as the xenophobia and demagogic populism that threaten our societies.\nThe Middle East, North Africa and Europe are confronting a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions resulting from the exodus of refugees and migrants, many of whom are very young children. We must get to the root of the problem and eradicate the terror and fear that have befallen the region, finding a politically sustainable solution for the conflict in Syria based on the recently negotiated ceasefire.\nAnother issue underlying this humanitarian crisis is the growing wave of immigration that is essentially the result of a lack of opportunities in the migrants\u2019 countries of origin. Resolving conflicts, stabilizing political situations and investing in countries\u2019 development are surely the best way to contribute to the stability and prosperity of all. Portugal has turned the willingness it expressed from the beginning of the crisis into the act of hosting migrants who need international protection. We have gone far beyond the European Union quota set out for us. Indeed, we have accepted twice the number of migrants than required under this quota. We will continue to take in these migrants and abide by the effective integration practices that characterize the welcoming and multicultural Portuguese society.\nI would like to stress the importance of promoting higher education for refugees in emergency situations so that a generation of migrants is not lost. Portugal has already accepted over 100 Syrian university students and calls for similar involvement on the part of many other countries. I myself am a university professor, and I have taught students from Syria.\nWith regard to the right to education, I would recall that 50 years ago the General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I call on all Member States that have not yet done so to join these important instruments.\nIn addition, on the issue of human rights, we have come a long way in terms of gender equality, although much still needs to be done. Gender issues are a topic of cross-cutting importance, particularly in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the women and peace and security agenda. Furthermore, as a member of the Human Rights Council, Portugal remains committed to the defence and promotion of human rights and the strengthening of bodies set up by human rights treaties.\nThe issue of oceans and seas is a priority for Portugal. History advises it, geography imposes it and the future demands it. In this regard, I would mention the Oceans Meeting 2016, which we hosted in Lisbon earlier this year. We will continue to work towards mobilizing global efforts aimed at the conservation and sustainable exploitation of the oceans. Accordingly, Portugal is looking forward to being an engaged participant at the first United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, on oceans, seas and marine resources, which will be held in New York in 2017. Furthermore, with regard to the link to climate change, I reiterate Portugal\u2019s commitment to small island developing States in supporting the efforts needed to overcome the challenges they face, which are the responsibility of the international community as a whole.\nFinally, as the process of appointing the next Secretary-General is under way, I would like to express my sincerest wish that whoever takes up this position has the human and professional qualities required to meet the challenge. He or she should possess the ability to bring together hearts and minds and embody the values and courses of action that Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela exemplified in their lives. We need someone who transcends their group or circle, uniting and representing everyone and not just a chosen few,\n16-29415 3/30 who will build bridges, listen and demonstrate the innate wisdom and leadership skills to make decisions with which everyone can identify and in which everyone feels included.\nAs Verg\u00edlio Ferreira, a great Portuguese writer, said, \u201cMine is the language of the sea.\u201d The Portuguese language is shared by 250 million speakers, represented by the nine States members of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, which celebrates its twentieth anniversary this year. Inspired, therefore, by the ocean \u2014 to some it is the Atlantic, to others it is the Pacific \u2014 which brings life to the planet and unites us all, I have come to address the General Assembly today. I wish the Assembly every success in the seventy-first session that we are now launching, reiterating that we support new President of the Assembly and welcome his leadership. Portugal\u2019s position is, has been and always will be to provide firm, enthusiastic support to the United Nations as it fulfils its role in building peace, liberty, development and justice throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring greetings from President Rafael Correa and an embrace from the people of Ecuador to all sister nations of our United Nations. The past decade of the citizens\u2019 revolution in Ecuador has shown us that to achieve development we must do everything opposite to the prescription that the neoliberal hegemony has given us in the past few years.\nIn the past decade of our own sovereign drafting of the Ecuadorian social contract, we have managed to restore faith and hope in a country that had been devastated. We have found that this hope can be translated into tangible results for our peoples, through the reduction of poverty and inequality, the redistribution of the fruits of economic growth, job creation, unprecedented access to public services and the guarantee of rights, free education and health care. We have recovered a demoralized country, which, after going through seven presidents in 10 years, a banking crisis created by our elites, who expelled hundreds of thousands of migrants from our country, the loss of sovereignty and the implantation of foreign military bases in our territory, opted to found a vibrant democracy and sovereign republic in the global system.\nTo do so, we had to break with the paradigms of a neoliberal ideological fundamentalism. Power is not only military and financial; it is above all the dominion of ideas. Power is hegemonic when it has the ability to generate consensus and common understandings and explain our history and our environment. To do this, the hegemonic Powers have appropriated words that we all use and imbued them with meaning in order to impose a political and moral agenda upon the planet. That is why, from the South, from the periphery, we must challenge the meaning of the major concepts that are often bandied about in this General Assembly. We must, for example, challenge the concept of \u201cdevelopment\u201d. To ensure that we are all following the same prescription they have tried to convince us that development is a technical issue, when it is primarily a political problem.\nIn Latin America, the most unequal region in the world, there can be no genuine sustainable development, social cohesion and political stability without redistribution. And that redistribution often means conflict with elites, who have historically opposed and continue to oppose relinquishing an iota of their power. It is no coincidence that Latin America \u2014 which I insist is the most unequal region of the world \u2014 has, for example, an average tax rate of 20 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), when industrialized countries have rates of 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent of GDP while the average rate for countries of the European Union is 39 per cent. But any rise in the tax rate to ensure that Latin American States can deliver rights, redistribute wealth or stimulate the economy, is resisted by our elites who mobilize all the resources at their disposal, including through the private media, the most powerful tool to maintain the status quo and destabilize Governments that dare to challenge their interests.\nTo achieve development, we have to break with the primary exporter model of capital accumulation. We must diversify our economies, change our production model and move away from an excessive dependence on raw materials. This idle profiteering, which is often based on cheap labour and unstable work and the bounties of nature rather than the innovative capacity of our people, means that our elites also oppose any deep-rooted productive transformations to achieve development.\nIn fact, the countries that have achieved development \u2014 in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, in North America and in Europe, and more recently in East Asia \u2014 used aggressive protectionist means to build their nascent industries, with an active regulatory and planning role for the State, with a disrespect for intellectual property that would make us blush today. But here is the irony: when those same countries achieved their development \u2014 as soon as they achieved a position of dominance with respect to productivity and competitiveness of their new industries \u2014 they joined the ahistorical narrative of development that I just mentioned.\nFriends of the global South, if we are to diversify our economies and change our models of production, let us do what they did and not what the countries that achieved development are telling us we must do. First and foremost, development is a political issue. One good example of that is the problem of tax evasion and tax havens. It is estimated that in the case of Ecuador an amount equivalent to 30 per cent of our gross domestic product \u2014 that is to say, one third of our economy \u2014 is being hidden \u2014 that is the precise word \u2014 in tax havens. Imagine the dynamic economic progress that could be made, how much poverty and inequality could be reduced, if that money had been invested in our country and if taxes had been paid.\nWe are now dealing with the challenge of rebuilding the zones of our country that suffered a terrible earthquake last April. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean calculates that the cost of reconstruction will be at least $3.3 billion, which means we have to make huge efforts and sacrifices for our country. But then there are the $30 billion hidden in tax havens.\nBut to put an end to such tax havens and to have critical resources for our development, we have to wage a political battle. It is good that some countries are committed to cooperation in the interest of development but there still is not one drop of assistance in an ocean of injustices, including financial, banking and tax practices that undermine our right to development. And then there are the practices by the same States to offset the phenomenon of capital flight resulting from banking secrecy and the low-to-zero tax rates with new, absolutely negligible cooperation.\nEcuador reiterates its call for the establishment of an intergovernmental body within the United Nations for tax justice \u2014 a democratic institutional structure that puts an end to the shameful practice of tax havens in the twenty-first century. Ecuador has taken the revolutionary decision to conduct a referendum in February 2017 to consult with our people whether they would agree with prohibiting all public servants, including those who were popularly elected, from holding capital and assets in tax havens. We are proud to present our ethical pact to the world. We are hoping that it would be an example of one way of fighting against global plutocracy, speculative capitalism and faceless, nameless, amoral, unethical capital that is hidden in order to avoid responsibility.\nAnother concept that is often manipulated for absolutely political purposes is that of human rights. Absolutely all political action in our Citizens\u2019 Revolution has been thought through from the perspective of human rights. Our Constitution is one of the most advanced in the world with respect to guaranteeing human rights, and it is the first Constitution to guarantee the rights of nature. Our Constitution establishes human rights as comprehensive and multidimensional, which means that importance is given to all rights \u2014 civil and political rights, of course, but also economic and social rights.\nWe believe that one cannot speak of guaranteeing human rights, especially in the context of Latin America, without speaking about the reduction of poverty and inequality. It is for that reason that we are one of the countries that has done the most to reduce poverty throughout the world, with a historic reduction by half of extreme poverty from 17 per cent in 2007 to 8.5 per cent in 2015. Poverty was reduced by one third from 36.7 per cent in 2007 to 23.3 per cent in 2015. Similarly, it is a point of pride that Ecuador is one the countries that have done the most to reduce inequality, which has been a huge scourge in Latin America. To be exact, our Gini coefficient fell by six points between 2007 and 2013. That also shows how we respect human rights.\nEcuador continues to push for peace. We do not have weapons of mass destruction. We are not at war with any country and we are not bombing anyone. Let us see to the immediate entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nIt is also important that we leave behind the vision that sees the State as the sole violator of human rights. Of course, States can violate human rights, but other actors can do so, too, especially transnational corporations. Ecuador has experience with such violations. The oil company Chevron Texaco contaminated our rivers and forests in our region of Amazon\u00eda, causing disease and death for our people and doing great damage to the Amazon jungle. The Chevron Texaco oil spill was 85 times bigger than the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and 18 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989. The difference is that the spill in Ecuador was not accidental, but rather a bid to make oil at a cheaper cost.\nEcuador is not the only country to have suffered such abuse. Transnational corporations cannot continue to operate without sufficient checks and balances in order to limit, regulate and supervise their activity with a view to the general interest of most of the people that inhabit the planet. We reiterate our plea for the adoption of a legally binding international instrument on transnational corporations and human rights. We are grateful for the trust in Ecuador expressed by States by appointing us to chair the open-ended intergovernmental working group to draft such a treaty.\nAt the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which took place in Paris, my country proposed the creation of an international environmental justice court to punish violations of the rights of nature and establish obligations in terms of ecological debt and consumption of environmental goods. We live in a world where there are courts to punish countries when they allegedly endanger or imperil the investments of major transnational corporations but there are no courts to punish those that unscrupulously degrade our environment. That paradox is so decisive and telling of the world in which we live, where supremacy belongs to capital over human beings. We claim the supremacy of human beings over capital.\nIt is imperative that, after decades of discussion, we accelerate the democratization of the United Nations. In particular, we must strike a new balance between the General Assembly and the Security Council with a view to increasing votes and decreasing vetoes. In that regard, it is urgent that we change the Council\u2019s composition, working methods and competencies, and limit its prerogatives. The use of the veto, exclusive privilege of the victors of the Second World War, which account for 70 per cent of the global arms trade, no longer ensures the ultimate objective of maintaining international peace and security. We must set a deadline to conclude negotiations on United Nations reform.\nSimilarly, we must reverse the diminution of the role multilateralism plays in global governance. We must reflect on how to address the emerging para- institutionality, where a club of exclusive and restricted number of countries have the clout to make the decisions that affect countries around the world. From the Group of 77, which Ecuador will have the honour of presiding over next year, let us demand more democracy and more equality among States. Let us leave behind the global order that preceded the great decolonization of the second half of the twentieth century, and let us do away with the model of first-, second- and third- class countries.\nOur liberator, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who said that the unity of our peoples is not a mere illusion of men, but an inexorable decree of destiny, would be proud to see us make bold strides in uniting the peoples of the South, and would celebrate Ecuador\u2019s active role in the fight to emancipate our peoples. We have made great progress in recent years in consolidating the progress and sovereignty of our nation within the global system, but there is still much left to be done. Regrettably, our America continues to be the victim of antiquated foreign interventionism and domestic reactionary attacks that seek to prevent the democratization of our societies. We still have a long way to go before our elites learn to recognize and respect universal suffrage and the votes of millions of people, in good times and in bad, whether or not it is in their interest. Let us stop playing games with democracy and the sacred mandate of our peoples!\nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge our people and the leadership of President Correa, a man who has done so much in the interest of full development, justice and equality. Ten years after the beginning of the Citizens\u2019 Revolution, we have replaced despair with hope, and we have shown humankind that political action can build a world where human beings are not merely instruments for accumulating wealth but rather the very purpose of Government.\nWe in Quito eagerly await one and all for the upcoming United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, to be held from 17 to 20 October 2016, where it will be our honour to host all of our guests in optimistic, hospitable and revolutionary Ecuador.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I believe that under his presidency, this session will make good progress on its agenda. I also wish to express appreciation for the effective work of Mr. Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has with modesty and a drive for harmony and inclusiveness worked diligently and in a down-to-earth manner over the past decade and whose work has contributed significantly to world peace, sustainable development and the advancement and protection of human rights around the world.\nIn 2015, the United Nations held a summit to consider the post-2015 development agenda and adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has offered a new vision for global development. At the summit, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping delivered a speech (see A/70/PV.7) entitled, \u201cTowards win-win partnerships for sustainable development\u201d, in which he expounded on China\u2019s principles and positions. The year 2016 is the first year for the implementation of that Agenda.\nThe general debate at the seventy-first session focuses on \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, a theme that could not be more relevant. On behalf of the Chinese Government, I would like to state today that China has taken action to advance the Agenda for Sustainable Development, and it has been one of the first States to submit its national plan on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the United Nations.\nSustainable development concerns development first and foremost, and development underpins every human achievement. Without development, nothing is sustainable. The lack of development is often at the root of many of the world\u2019s problems \u2014 poverty, the refugee crisis, war, conflicts or terrorism. All of these could be attributed to insufficient development, and none of them can be satisfactorily resolved without development. Only development can guarantee people\u2019s fundamental rights and interests. Only development can root out the causes for global challenges. Only development can promote human civilization and progress.\nOf course, development must be sustainable in all its dimensions. Otherwise, development, and especially growth, will stall. Growth will stall and be held back. Development cannot be sustainable if it is unbalanced and unequal and widens the gap between the North and the South, and between the rich and the poor. Development cannot be sustainable if it is expensive, if it is driven by high consumption with high pollution and high carbon emissions, or if it depletes resources and strains the environment. Development cannot be sustainable if economic growth and social progress are not well coordinated. Only when we have a profound understanding of the implications of sustainability, make progress in poverty reduction at all levels, engage in North-South and South-South cooperation, adapt to climate change, and promote equal sharing and green development can we ensure that development will hold its ground and be sustainable.\nSustainable development must be inclusive and interconnected. Currently, the sustainable development endeavour is faced with great challenges. Regional conflicts and hotspots are without end. Traditional and non-traditional security threats intertwine, and the environment for sustainable development gives no reason for optimism. World economic recovery remains lukewarm, and globalization faces strong headwinds. The momentum for sustainable development is weak. There are frequent outbreaks of major infectious diseases and the eruption of natural disasters. Other issues to be faced are energy and resource security, food security and financial security. As those elements become intertwined, sustainable development necessarily faces an uphill battle. Such difficult moments call for greater confidence.\nHumankind has the wisdom and the ability to find a way out. For that to happen, there must be cooperation and a spirit of working together to overcome difficulties. It is time that the international community assumes a new perspective, sees itself as a community with a shared future and interconnected interests and makes concerted efforts to tackle global challenges.\nFor sustainable development to evolve, we must keep both short-term and long-term interests in mind while making concrete efforts to tackle challenges, actively transform and change our world, and achieve our new vision. We are ready to and must uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Without peace and stability, there will be no sustainable development; even the development gains already attained risk being lost.\nThe hard-won peace that has prevailed over the past 70 or more years testifies to the effectiveness of the international order and the norms of international relations based on the United Nations Charter. These norms and this order must be resolutely upheld since they not only serve the common interests of the people of all countries but also provide the most essential guarantee for achieving sustainable development.\nAll countries need to observe and effectively implement the purposes and principles of the Charter, support the leading role of the United Nations and the Security Council in global affairs, and support the reform and improvement of global governance mechanisms to reflect the changes in the international, political and economic landscape. A new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security should be nurtured. A global partnership that features dialogue instead of confrontation, and mutual, win-win benefits should be established.\nWe must pursue political solutions to hotspot issues. Political solutions are the fundamental way out. History has repeatedly shown that to repress violence with force can only lead to more hatred and warfare from which no winner will emerge. Parties involved in conflicts must renounce a zero-sum mentality, settle disputes through dialogue, address differences through consultation and seek reconciliation with tolerance. The mediation efforts of the international community must be fair and impartial; they should facilitate the settlement of issues, not invite new problems.\nOn Syria, we must remain committed to a political solution. The international community should encourage all relevant parties in Syria to end the fighting at an early date and reach a comprehensive political solution.\nOn the Korean nuclear issue, we should remain committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, uphold peace and stability on the peninsula and seek consultation and dialogue so as to effectively maintain the international nuclear-non-proliferation regime.\nTerrorism is the common enemy of humankind and must be combatted resolutely. At the same time, double standards should not be applied, nor should terrorism be linked with particular countries, races or religions.\nWe must work together for the safe, steady recovery of the world economy, which cannot afford to maintain the long-term sluggishness we see now. Otherwise, sustainable development will be a fountain without a source. The current world economy is faced with both insufficient aggregate demand and prominent structural contradictions. We need to employ various kinds of effective policy instruments in a holistic manner, combine demand management with supply-side reform, and balance short-term policies with long-term ones.\nWe call on all countries to make concerted efforts to drive the global economy along a road of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Given their significant influence, major economies need to act responsibly in policymaking, particularly when coordinating macroeconomic policies. While focusing on their own growth, they also need to strive to reduce negative spillover and refrain from adding to the weakness of the global economic recovery.\nEconomic globalization, represented by liberalization in and facilitation of trade and investment, has been a significant driving force behind rapid global growth in past decades, but it is no panacea to the ills of the world. Frankly, globalization has to some degree taken its toll on industries and communities in certain countries. Active measures need to be taken to address the problem, but it is always important to keep in mind the bigger picture, instead of focusing only on narrower interests.\nGlobalization is consistent with the long-term and fundamental interests of all countries. It is the trend of the times. Countries need to firmly oppose protectionism in all its forms, resolutely uphold the free-trade regime represented by the World Trade Organization and promote sustained and sound economic growth for all countries through win-win and all-win cooperation. We must exert ourselves to address global challenges facing humankind. Greater attention and more support need to be given to Africa and the least developed countries to help them speed up industrialization, ensure food security and eliminate poverty and hunger so that more people can lead a life of decency and dignity.\nMore needs to be done to create an international environment that helps reduce inequality and imbalance in global development. International institutions should spend their new resources on helping developing countries on a priority basis. Developed countries should make good on their official development assistance commitments, while developing countries need to pursue self-development and find paths suited to their national conditions.\nAs we speak, the world is facing the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War. It is imperative to ensure refugee access to basic living conditions in order to stave off humanitarian crises. It is of fundamental importance to root out the causes of war and renew development so that countries of origin of refugees can embark on a path of enduring peace, development and prosperity.\nCountries need to stay committed to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities. They also need to jointly tackle climate change and work for the Paris Agreement to be universally accepted and take effect at an early date. Developed countries need to play a leading role, deliver on their emissions-reduction pledges and help developing countries improve their capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\nSince China adopted its reform and opening-up policy, the Chinese economy has maintained rapid growth, becoming the world\u2019s second-largest economy in 2010. In 2014, China\u2019s gross domestic product reached $10 trillion. In recent years, despite a greater basis of measurement for development, overall global complexity and long-accumulated underlying domestic issues, China has relied on reform and innovation to maintain a medium-high growth rate and promoted economic transformation and upgrading.\nIn the first half of this year, our growth rate was 6.7 per cent, which was among the fastest in the major economies. Over 13 million new urban jobs are added annually. In other words, in the first eight months of this year, 9.5 million new urban jobs were created. Every percentage point of growth now equals several percentage points of growth in previous years, and the yearly economic increment is tantamount to the economic aggregate of a middle-income country. China\u2019s effective management of its own affairs has been its greatest contribution to the world. Its contribution to global economic growth has been around 30 per cent.\nHowever, we remain sober about our achievements and believe that China remains a developing country; there is still a long way to go before China achieves modernization. We will continue to give priority to development and pursue comprehensive social and economic growth, maintain a medium-high speed of economic growth and move to a medium-high level of development. China will continue to promote development through deepening reform.\nReform has held the key to our previous achievements in development, and the same will hold true for the future. We will promote development through expanding our opening-up policy. China\u2019s experience in past decades proves that a closed-door policy only leads to stagnation and backwardness, and it is opening up that brings development and prosperity. With a firm commitment to the win-win strategy of opening up, China will open its door even wider to the outside world.\nChina will promote development by upholding peace. The prolonged sufferings of war have made the Chinese people cherish peace more than ever. As a dedicated follower of the path of peaceful development, China will pursue friendship and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We uphold a mutual respect among all countries, regardless of their size.\nChina also believes in working through dialogue, negotiation and friendly consultation to address various differences and issues, including disputes over territory and maritime rights and interests. We need to expand common ground, shelve differences and make continuous efforts for regional peace and stability.\nChina has always worked for the peaceful settlement of hotspot issues. On the occasion of this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly, China has clearly indicated that it will provide $300 million worth of humanitarian assistance to relevant countries and international organizations. Additionally, China will provide assistance on all fronts to the underdeveloped and least developed countries.\nChina is a developing country with a population of 1.3 billion. We need to run our own affairs effectively while working to fulfil our due international responsibilities. By the end of 2015, China had contributed a total of over \u00a5400 billion to 166 countries and international and regional organizations and provided training in various sectors to over 12 million professionals from other developing countries. Going forward, China will strengthen cooperation with other developing countries and do whatever it can to help African countries and the least developing countries.\nChina will only increase, not reduce, its support and assistance to other countries only as our economy grows. We stand ready to work with all countries to achieve common development and prosperity and to support sustainable development and international cooperation in relevant fields. By 2020, China will increase its total annual contributions to United Nations development agencies by $100 million over its 2015 contribution level. China is a country that backs its words with action. We will translate our commitments into real actions.\nAchieving the goals for sustainable development is our shared task. Transforming our world and making it a better place is the common aspiration of all of us. China stands ready to work with other members of the international community, and make appropriate contributions to building a world free from want where development and dignity are ensured for all.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured and privileged to address the Assembly on behalf of Algeria and to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We share the priorities that you have identified for this session, and we reaffirm our commitment to working with you to achieve them. I wish also to express Algeria\u2019s gratitude to your predecessor for the initiatives he took when he presided over the Assembly.\nThis session began in the context of a turbulent global situation that is deeply concerning, in addition to the long-standing conflicts to which no solution is in sight. There are new threats to international peace and security that require urgent and serious action. The international community is witnessing unprecedented mass movements of people not seen since the Second World War. A high-level meeting was dedicated to this issue three days ago in order to identify the developments that have taken place in the context of this serious phenomenon. The images of the thousands of people who have had no choice other than to take a perilous journey cannot be seen only from the perspective of migration. Conventional solutions, such as exclusion, cannot be used here.\nThe situation is in fact a test for all of us. In that respect, the President of the Republic, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during his presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session, said, from this very rostrum:\n\u201cThe concept of universality is also a moral necessity. It means that in the face of the unity of humankind, racial barriers are crumbling away in the same way as differences in economic and social status are gradually fading.\u201d (A/PV.2233, para. 28)\nWe can conclude from this idea, expressed by President Bouteflika more than 40 years ago, that the ability of the international community to overcome such phenomena will require great solidarity. Algeria contributes to such actions as well as to the quest for lasting solutions that reflect our commitment to the values and principles upon which the United Nations was founded.\nIn order to address such challenges, and learning from the painful lessons of the Second World War, the founders of the United Nations devised a collective security order based on equality, which must be enhanced on an ongoing basis so as to reject narrow interests and intolerance in all their forms. If there is one main task that we have to champion in the United Nations, it is for this Organization to be the main catalyst of the hopes of all peoples. Our Organization, given its moral stature, must earn the respect of all Member States. It should be a source of inspiration to all of humankind in situations of crisis with respect to the right to self-determination, respect for human rights, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and all of the other principles enshrined in the Charter.\nIt is clearer than ever before that the United Nations is facing unprecedented challenges. Now is the time to stress that the United Nations is a unique body and is capableof mobilizing the required consensus and overcoming the challenges at hand. It is unfair to blame our Organization for all the violations that are taking place in the world. Such violations may be attributed only to Member States, because our Organization is a reflection of their political will.\nWe cannot indefinitely postpone the reform and modernization of United Nations mechanisms, for which Algeria has called repeatedly. In this respect, I must express our satisfaction with the outcome of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit recently held in Venezuela. The Movement has stressed the urgent need for such reform. Reform of the United Nations has taken on special importance.\nWe are required to provide answers to a simple question. Are the mechanisms that were put in place after the Second World War still valid, given that most of the world\u2019s people were not independent at the time? International balances of power and policies were different then. The answer is that we need to redesign the entire system of global governance with respect to political, economic, security and environmental matters. This is not impossible. The wise consensus of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is evidence of the fact that reform can be achieved through negotiation. Such fruitful and laudable negotiation can guarantee success.\nThe challenges to development are growing, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. There is no single person who is immune to the current security threats. That is evidenced by the threats of international terrorism that occur every day. Redoubling efforts to bring about peace in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and the Central African Republic and to peacefully settle the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi is a moral and political obligation for the international community.\nRegarding the just cause of Palestine and its occupied territories, the failure of the international community to find a viable solution that would include the full recognition of the rights of Palestinian people and the territories occupied since 1967, and that would establish Palestine as an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital, serves to underline the failure of the contemporary international order.\nMr. El Haycen (Mauritania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nIn our Maghreb region, whose inhabitants have much in common, the mission to bring peace to Western Sahara, led by the United Nations, has encountered a couple of hurdles this year. The United Nations, in particular the Security Council, has lost some of its authority. Such developments threaten the integrity of the approach taken by the United Nations. This disturbing situation underlines once again the urgent need to settle such disputes in accordance with international legitimacy and to implement the inalienable right of the Sahrawi to self-determination. Hence, in this particular situation, we would like to stress again that the United Nations is still committed to ending the occupation in Western Sahara.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda represents progress and gives us hope of attaining our noble goal of ensuring that no one is left behind. But international economic expectations and the outlooks of international organizations dampen our optimism, because they note the magnitude of the challenges faced. Such challenges threaten the success of efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly the reduction of poverty. Additionally, they denote declining investments in developing countries and a decline in the amount of the official development assistance (ODA) that we will receive. ODA has already been in decline for the past couple of years. The trend towards reduced ODA from rich countries will prove even more detrimental as the financial needs of developing countries grow.\nDeveloped countries must change their consumption patterns in a way that benefits production in developing countries. The commitments we have made to reducing inequality require a genuine transformation of the economic models of rich countries that will take into consideration the interests of all. The same principle has to apply to the transfer of technology to developing countries, since technology is an urgent prerequisite if they truly are to enhance national capabilities. In this respect, the highest priority has to be given to Africa to enable it to build infrastructure and fulfil basic needs like water and electricity supply. In addition, it is necessary to enable African countries to participate in income-generating activities at the global level and to be economically competitive.\nAlgeria has undertaken its development efforts in a spirit of self-reliance. We have drawn on our own resources by utilizing innovative financial tools. That which Algeria seeks for the United Nations in terms of reform, openness and transparency has been applied in Algeria. Under the strong leadership of its President, Algeria adopted a constitutional amendment whose democratic provisions are designed to enhance the rule of law, increase individual freedoms, bolster the institutional role of opposition parties, liberate national economic capacities, empower women and establish Amazigh languages as official national languages. That is an important step on our historic path. It will help to build a peaceful, open and strong community. Since Algeria is stable and at peace with itself, it can also effectively contribute to bringing about peace, security, stability and prosperity in neighbouring countries and beyond.\nAlgeria, which is making a renewed commitment to the United Nations and to what it represents, commends the commitment made by Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose tenure as Secretary-General is coming to an end.\nMr. Ban undertook his responsibilities wholeheartedly and achieved significant results. He demonstrated that the task of Secretary-General is not an impossible one for a person like himself, who made every effort, using his heart and mind, to achieve the noble goals that he\n28/28 16-29559 committed to when he was elected. We would like to thank him and to wish him every success in his new endeavours.\n"

        "file_text": "I am extremely happy to take part in the seventy-first session of the General Assembly as the President of Sri Lanka.\nI would like to convey the current situation in my country. For the past 20 months, my leadership has helped usher in a new era of social, political and economic transformations in my country. Before I came to power, people in my country were living in fear and suspicion. I have laid the foundation for strengthening the rule of law and restoring democratic rights for the people of Sri Lanka so that they can live happily in a free and democratic society. My Government seeks to make the people of Sri Lanka among the happiest people on Earth. To that end, we have taken steps to strengthen freedom and democracy while achieving economic prosperity. The Government is committed to making the people of Sri Lanka a developed nation.\nPoverty is a global challenge. I am determined to alleviate poverty in my country. I have therefore declared 2017 to be the Year of Eliminating Poverty in Sri Lanka. I have developed a basic platform to help people emerge from poverty in a country that prioritizes economic progress. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development serves as the guiding principles for all nations and institutions, led by the United Nations, to bring about the economic, social and environmental transformations that will make the world a better place. In that regard, we recognize that economic development plays a key role, and that environmental sustainability, particularly the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, will remain a main pillar in our endeavour to bring about the necessary changes in my country. With the educated younger generations in mind, Sri Lanka\u2019s national development strategy will give prominence to building a green and innovation-based economy through progressive reforms and planning.\nAs an island nation, Sri Lanka wishes to make maximum use of its ocean resources, with a new emphasis on ocean research, tourism, fisheries and marine resources. The Government seeks to further improve the free health-care and education systems, while providing greater technology to agriculture and domestic industry, so as to ensure that our people live better lives.\nIn many parts of the world, we see the unfortunate proliferation of anger, hatred, brutality and conflict. I would say that contemporary society is experiencing a crisis of morality. I believe that all States should heed the cry for moral values and that every society must dedicate itself to raising the level of positive moral values.\nSri Lanka is a Buddhist country where Theravada Buddhism is practiced. The teachings of the Buddha help us find solutions to many of the burning issues of the contemporary world. Similarly, I am sure that the wisdom offered by the great world religions \u2014 such as Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and others \u2014 can help us today. I am therefore of the view that we as States must strengthen and foster those religions and philosophies that help us look inward.\nI take this opportunity to draw the attention of this gathering to a significant obstacle in our progress as the world community, that is, the menace of drugs and intoxicants that has beset society, including youth and schoolchildren. As the President of Brazil pointed out (see A/71/PV.8), illicit drugs have become the most serious challenge faced by society today. While endorsing his ideas, I would urge the world community, the United Nations and all States to commit to fighting illegal drugs collectively and individually through a robust international programme that is more organized and stronger than the one currently in place.\nOn the domestic front, my Government has taken effective measures to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and good governance, paving the way for positive change to ensure that war will never again take place on the soil of my country, Sri Lanka. The reconciliation process under way today has taken lessons learned from the bitter experience of a brutal war that lasted three decades. The process will ensure that my country will never again see the cruelty of war or terrorism and that all communities will live peacefully in a rational and a free-thinking Sri Lanka. For that noble purpose, Sri Lanka welcomes the collaboration and blessings that it has received from international organizations and the international community.\nSri Lanka is a free, independent nation, and I intend to preserve and protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in line with the policies of all of the other nations gathered here today. As such, my country will seek its own recipe for the reconciliation process and the necessary transformation and reform efforts, based on respect for the essential indigenous thinking of the local people. Sri Lanka will adhere to a social democratic policy and work closely with the international community towards prosperity and wisdom, in line with the rest of the world.\nFollowing the war that traumatized the nation for three decades, we have started the journey towards national reconciliation and lasting peace. However, we will not hurry; rather, we will tread each step with care, vigilance, patience and persistence. My beloved Sri Lanka has big dreams. I look forward to the blessings and collaboration of Member States to achieve them.\nI thank the United Nations and its agencies for the ongoing support provided to Sri Lanka. I am honoured to mention the contributions made by the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in fostering international development and strengthening democracy and human rights. Those efforts are a blessing to humankind.\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize my commitment to empowering our youth with the best knowledge in the world. We are also embarking upon a reconciliation programme, with a view to Sri Lanka becoming an exemplary democracy in the world. My Government will fulfil its responsibilities towards its people, and I seek Member States\u2019 assistance and blessings in that noble endeavour.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, on his election to his important position. I assure him of my country\u2019s full support for his effort. At the same time, I wish to express my warm gratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his active presidency during the seventieth session, during which I was honoured to take part for the first time in my capacity as the President of the Republic of Poland.\nSustainable development, the protection of human rights, and peace and security are the goals pursued by the United Nations the achievement of which humankind deeply yearns. By adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the new Sustainable Development Goals last year, we demonstrated that we are capable of acting together as an international community to achieve success, implement the required tasks and, at the same time, approach new ambitious goals.\nI wish to address the three foundations of sustainable development, without which such development will never be possible. It is my profound conviction that these are the rules with which we should all identify if we truly care about human happiness and the successful progress of our nations. These three rules \u2014 the three foundations of sustainable development \u2014 are responsibility, solidarity and justice.\nResponsibility arises from our obligation to safeguard the heritage that we are going to leave to our children and grandchildren: how we are going to be remembered by them and what they are going to write about us in history books. Responsibility is underpinned by the conviction that history neither begins nor ends here and now, but is a succession of generations, destinies and commitments.\nUnderstood in that way, responsibility nowadays pertains in particular to social issues and the natural environment. Responsible development is development that cares for the appropriate continuity to be preserved between generations \u2014 past, present and future. As in an Olympic relay, the smooth handing off of the baton is of key importance when one approaches the changeover box.\nOn many occasions, as history has illustrated, this historical continuity is interrupted. This is what happens when people want to build too rapidly while destroying what our forebearers left behind, acting against their beliefs and their sense of rightness. When order gives in to chaos, social bonds are destroyed and fear and anxiety are aroused. When respect for tradition is absent and social engineering is used instead, development itself is not possible, let alone sustainable development.\nProgress that does not create but destroys is in fact regression. Family is the basic form of human community that harmoniously links together succeeding generations. That is why solicitude for its durability and welfare is so crucially significant. Human rights are also family rights, and their attainment involves active support for a multigenerational society. The main instrument of the latter is a pro-family policy.\nI am proud to declare that the authorities of the Republic of Poland are now carrying out an ambitious programme for improving the living conditions of children in Polish families. The groundwork underpinning any development is the creation of appropriate conditions for the conception of new life.\nThe second challenge to sustainable development, one which also calls for responsible policies, is care for the natural environment. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will not be possible without fighting the degradation of nature \u2014 an effort to be undertaken with determination and consistency. We were reminded by Pope Francis, in his encyclical Laudato si\u2019, that the natural environment is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all.\nThe immensity of the challenges we face can be best illustrated by the fact that, at the recent International Geological Congress, scholars came to the conclusion that we might describe a new geological era, termed Anthropocene. For the very first time in the history of the Earth, this era has not been determined by geological but by human activity.\nWe realize what grave environmental consequences changes in the natural environment produce. However, their social, economic and political ramifications are of equal importance. We can already ask ourselves whether we are threatened by climate wars. This is precisely why only global actions undertaken in concord by all States can bring about improvement in the condition of nature on our Earth.\nLast year in Paris we jointly demonstrated that we are capable of taking responsible decisions by adopting a new climate agreement. The Republic of Poland was an active participant in those negotiations. I wish to inform the Assembly that Poland has initiated the process of ratifying the Paris Agreement and the Doha Amendment. As President of the Republic of Poland, I attach great importance to its conclusion as quickly as possible, in line with the provisions of our Constitution.\nResponsibility for the natural environment, however, involves more than the mere prevention of climate change. In line with the spirit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it also includes protecting the water and the soil and fighting desertification. Responsible development requires a balanced approach, and therefore the natural environment should be viewed from the three perspectives of water, soil and air.\nIf it is to be sustainable, development must also take into account the specificity of individual countries, particularly their economic and employment structures.\nThe second pillar of sustainable development is solidarity. This concept is particularly close to the hearts of the Polish people, who, led by the social movement bearing the same name, carried out a peaceful political transformation a quarter of a century ago, rejecting the system founded on lies and enslavement. It is thanks to a community that is sensitive to the misfortunes of others and respectful of all people, regardless of their origin or financial situation, that Polish solidarity is built upon such durable foundations. Today the Republic of Poland implements the principle of solidarity on two planes: domestic, and global.\nSolidarity is a development undertaken in the name of welfare for all social groups, not only those that are strongest and most influential. Politics operating in the spirit of solidarity are politics that care for the weakest, not the strongest. That is why it must rely on solidarity between employers and employees, and solidarity between more developed and less developed regions.\nFinally, the most fundamental solidarity is a solidarity with those who have a sense of attainment, with those who struggle to survive each and every day. Only a development model founded on solidarity is capable of producing a system where man, his needs and his aspirations are at its centre. This system must afford equal opportunities to all and allow us to tap into the potential represented by those who have thus far been living in social exclusion.\nIt is the concept of development founded on solidarity that lies at the heart of the policies pursued by Poland\u2019s present Government. In line with its tenets, improvement of the quality of life of all citizens should arise from the measures taken by the Government, and not just macroeconomic indicators, which are often insufficient in translating the advancement of the former.\nWe do not want to be captives of economic dogmas; we want solutions that allow the active participation of all social groups in development processes, giving them equal opportunity to benefit from economic growth. Such solutions will produce the expected outcomes for restraining exclusion and poverty and for levelling out social inequalities.\nOur policy is therefore consistent with the ambitious vision of the 2030 Agenda, which we jointly decided to implement one year ago. I think the time has come to start a global coalition of States for the solidarity-based development of societies. Solidarity in international relations is, first and foremost, humanitarian and developmental aid in all territories affected by military conflicts, economic crises or natural disasters.\nThe unprecedented scale of migration flows in the contemporary world \u2014 a phenomenon that we need to confront directly \u2014 is a reminder of our great shared responsibility: to begin actions to eliminate the real roots of poverty and to guarantee everyone the right to live in his or her own home country.\nPoland has been watching with anxiety and concern the growing number of people affected by conflicts, especially in Syria and in Ukraine. Guided by our sense of solidarity, we have increased our humanitarian and development aid in the Middle East region and to the East.\nIn our efforts to build peace and sustainable development, we attach great importance to the education of children and young people. That is why we provide financial support to education projects in Africa. My country has been, and will continue to be, an active advocate for solidarity in the international arena.\nThe third pillar of sustainable development is justice. A just and equitable order, where the sustainable development model can be delivered, is founded on respect for human rights and the law of nations. Individual freedom, the dignity of the human person, the inviolability of human life and freedom of conscience and religion are all constituent parts of the catalogue of inalienable human rights, which nowadays call for particular protection. There are far too many places around the world where freedom is restricted by an oppressive political system, human dignity is violated and humankind\u2019s most fundamental right \u2014 the right to life \u2014 is encroached upon.\nOur fundamental objection is that there are so many places in the world where people die because of the religion they profess, which is only a matter of conscience. We cannot stay silent in the face of suffering Christians who are murdered in the name of religious fanaticism. The world must react to the phenomenon of religion-based genocide, which has become increasingly common.\nThat is why Poland welcomed with particular satisfaction the fact that the protection of human rights has been given pride of place among the priorities of the new development agenda. Through our global agreement, we have jointly reaffirmed the interdependence that exists between development and human rights and freedoms. Only through respect for all human rights \u2014 political, social, economic and cultural \u2014 can we fully harness human potential and eventually implement the sustainable development model. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that all human rights are derived from the most fundamental one, namely, the right to life.\nOur endeavours to make the world a better place to live will be futile, however, if we are incapable of safeguarding the absolute primacy of international law in relations among States. Last year, in this very Hall, I spoke about the need to ground international relations in law (see A/70/PV.13). I went on to emphasize that all States were equally obligated to carry out their international commitments and that any actions violating provisions of international law, among them political sovereignty and territorial integrity in particular, should be categorically denounced by the global community.\nToday, I wish to reiterate, in the clearest terms, that we must abide by the rules, a principle best expressed by a Roman proverb, \u201cex injuria jus non oritur\u201d, meaning that law cannot arise from illegal acts. A non-agressor has a right to the territory he occupies. We reject the system by which it is the politics of force and aggression that decides a nation\u2019s destiny. Peace and security are two fundamental preconditions for sustainable development. The effectiveness of global action in that regard will depend on international solidarity and concerted action among States.\nIn the meantime, any act of aggression that encroaches on international commitments undermines mutual trust among States and societies. It undermines the order that was so strenuously built in the wake of the Second World War. That is why it is so crucially important to ensure that the policy of force will always be met with the decisive opposition of the international community. For the law to be effective, any violation thereof must absolutely trigger the execution of significant countermeasures.\nI also wish to highlight the fact that the realization of the principle of justice in international relations is equally jeopardized if we decide to base it on the division of spheres of influence among super-Powers, for proxy wars would break out, respect for the subjective status of weaker States would disappear and the freedom and equality of States and nations would be encroached upon. Let us recall than any instance of peace made at the expense of someone else\u2019s freedom can hardly ever last and is never equitable.\nThis year, my country has hosted two events that restore faith in the power of international cooperation among States and nations. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in July testified to NATO\u2019s unity in the effort to build peace and freedom in the trans-Atlantic space. It was an expression of the failed responsibility of NATO countries that led to an agreement resulting in Europe\u2019s heightened security. The outcomes of the Warsaw Summit are an expression of allied solidarity and respect for the independence of free nations, and hence the values that underpin equitable international order.\nSoon after the NATO Summit, in my hometown of Krakow, we celebrated International Youth Day, during which young people from all over the world met with Pope Francis. Those days were a time of celebration, a time of joy, friendship and love. The young people who gathered in Poland taught us that the road to peace begins with human solidarity, based on concern for others regardless of origin or religion.\nResponsibility, solidarity and justice are the pillars on which Poland would like to build an international community for the sustainable development of free nations and equal States.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I hope that his able stewardship will lead this session to a successful outcome. I also hope that this session, under the theme \u201cSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, will make a meaningful contribution to promoting the peaceful development and prosperity of all countries.\nPeace and security are the permanent themes of the United Nations. The Sustainable Development Goals presuppose peace and security. Even at this very moment, when the United Nations aspires to a transformation through sustainable development, the world is besieged with the wild wind of terrorism, an unprecedented war-driven refugee crisis and an increasing number of global hot spots.\nThe Korean peninsula has now been turned into the world\u2019s most dangerous hot spot and could even ignite a nuclear war. A peaceful environment is the foremost prerequisite for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, which has embarked on the implementation of its national five-year economic development strategy to re-energize the overall economy and lay the foundation for its sustainable development.\nAs the international community witnesses every year, the Korean peninsula is often engulfed in a situation that can spiral out of control. Its root cause lies squarely with the United States of America, which refuses to abandon its hostile policy towards the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, but instead holds aggressive war exercises, one after another, in and around the Korean peninsula. The large-scale joint military exercises conducted by the United States in March and April and in August and September this year were extremely provocative and massive military manoeuvres. They involved over 500,000 troops and strategic assets that included strategic nuclear bombers and strategic nuclear submarines. Their scale is more than large enough to wage an all-out war.\nSuch nuclear war exercises are extremely offensive and aggressive, as they mainly include high- precision strikes, commando infiltration, landing and pre-emptive nuclear strikes aimed at the decapitation of the leadership of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the occupation of Pyongyang. Nowhere in the world today are such large-scale joint military exercises as those around the Korean peninsula conducted, nor do war games of such a provocative and offensive nature take place. Never have such undisguised military threats and extremely dangerous and aggressive exercises occurred right under the nose of an adversary.\nNo proper institutional peace mechanism has been established on the Korean peninsula. The war of the 1950s has not ended, but a temporary armistice remains in force. That means that neither side feels the need to make a declaration of war if it wants to begin fighting again. It is a place where provocative military acts such as large-scale joint military exercises can easily infuriate the other side, provoking a response.\n48/58 16-29667 Any incident could easily lead to a conflict and escalate into all-out war. Concerns are increasingly being voiced about the aggravation of tensions by these large-scale joint military exercises. We hear concerns being expressed in neighbouring countries, many countries of the region and even the United States of America and South Korea. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has made every possible effort to prevent an armed conflict and its escalation, while taking the necessary self-defensive countermeasures, whenever the United States and South Korea conduct provocative, aggressive joint military exercises.\nThe respected leader Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, noted at the seventh Congress of the Party that the United States should abandon its anachronistic hostile policy towards our country, replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and withdraw its armed forces and war equipment from South Korea. He also clarified that dialogue and negotiations were needed, above all, between the military authorities of North and South Korea so as to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula and achieve national reunification. But there has been no positive response, and the large-scale joint military exercises targeting the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea have continued. And they are becoming more and more provocative and aggressive.\nCurrently on the international scene, the fundamental, widely recognized principles of international relations are being openly ignored by the United States-led imperialist forces in their outrageous schemes for domination and intervention, while justice is being criminalized and transformed into injustice, depending on the interests of the imperialist Powers.\nTo safeguard international peace and security and achieve sustainable development, genuine international justice must be realized without fail. Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations refers to bringing about\n\u201cby peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace\u201d.\nHowever, when the Security Council deals with the issue of the Korean peninsula, it now covers up the high-handedness and arbitrariness of the United States of America in the name of the United Nations, ignoring justice and international law.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in accordance with Articles 34 and 35 of the Charter, has on several occasions requested the Security Council to hold an emergency meeting on the threat to international peace and security posed by the large-scale United States joint military exercises on the Korean peninsula. This year alone, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea made such requests to the Security Council in March and in August, but the Council rejected them every time. On the other hand, the Security Council takes issue with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s rightful self-defence measures to safeguard its sovereignty, dignity and national security.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea had no other choice but to go nuclear after doing everything possible to defend its national security from the constant United States nuclear threat, which has persisted since the 1950s. Our decision to strengthen our nuclear armament is a rightful self-defence measure to protect ourselves from constant United States nuclear threats. Nevertheless, the Security Council, as recently as in its resolution 2270 (2016), declared that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s ongoing nuclear and ballistic missile-related activities pose a clear threat to international peace and security. That resolution is the latest fabrication against my country. As for the legal basis for the resolution, neither the Charter of the United Nations nor any other international convention has a provision stipulating that nuclear and ballistic missile activity represents a threat to international peace and security.\nIn practice, countries that began the same activities long before the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea have never been called into question in the Security Council. One cannot help but ask on what grounds and with what authority did the Security Council adopt resolution 2270 (2016), which prohibits the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea from engaging in nuclear and ballistic missile activities. If the Council has such grounds and authority, why does it not adopt resolutions against countries that conduct the same nuclear and ballistic rocket tests? We submitted an official questionnaire to the Secretariat of the United Nations in this regard, but nearly four months have elapsed and the Secretariat has not responded.\nYet, the reason is clear. It is because the Security Council is the place where guilt or innocence is decided on the basis not of justice, but of whether one has the veto power. The United States of America does not have the moral authority to force United Nations Member States to implement this kind of undeserved resolution, and Member States have no moral obligation to implement these unfair and unjust resolutions.\nLast week, the 17th Summit of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM) was held on the beautiful island of Margarita in Venezuela. In the final document, the Heads of State and Government expressed concern that\n\u201cIn recent years, the Security Council has been too quick to threaten or authorize enforcement action in some cases while being silent and inactive in others\u201d.\nThey underlined that\n\u201cSanctions should be imposed only when a threat to international peace and security or an act of aggression takes place, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\u201d\nIn the Final Declaration of the Margarita Summit, the Heads of State and Government\n\u201cexpressed their condemnation at the promulgation and application of unilateral coercive measures against countries of the Movement, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly the principles of non-intervention, self-determination and independence of States\u201d.\nThis is the common position of the NAM countries that make up nearly two thirds of the membership of the United Nations. This is the true voice of the international community. International justice never comes by itself; it can be achieved only when the voice of independent countries against imperialism grows strong.\nOpting to become an armed nuclear Power is our State policy. As long as there is a nuclear-weapon State that is hostile to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, our national security and peace on the Korean peninsula can be defended only by means of a credible nuclear deterrent. The reason why we had no other option but to strengthen our nuclear deterrence unreservedly may not be easily understood by European countries, whose security awareness attenuated following the end of the Cold War 25 years ago, or by countries that have never had the nuclear weapons of a hostile Power on their doorstep and in their air space.\nThe successful nuclear warhead explosion test that we conducted recently is a practical countermeasure taken in reaction to the host of threats and sanctions from hostile forces, including the United States of America, that viciously make an issue of the exercise by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea of its right to self-defence. The test also demonstrates our Party\u2019s and people\u2019s strongest will ever in its readiness to wage a counter-attack against provocation by enemies.\nOnly a couple of days ago, the United States again threatened the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea by flying B-1B strategic bombers over the Military Demarcation Line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea. We will never remain onlookers to such acts of provocation, and the United States will have to face inconceivable consequences. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will continue to take measures to strengthen its national nuclear- armed forces, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in order to defend its dignity and right to existence, and to safeguard genuine peace vis-\u00e0-vis the increased threat of nuclear war by the United States.\nIn order to safeguard global peace and security by realizing genuine international justice, and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, the old international order, where injustice prevails under the guise of justice, must be destroyed to give way to a new international order of impartiality and justice.\nThe blockade unjustly imposed on Cuba by the United States of America for the past several decades is a typical example of the total absence of international justice. The delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea takes this opportunity to extend full support and solidarity to the Government and people of Cuba in their struggle to safeguard the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and realize international justice in the face of the high-handedness, arbitrariness and unilateral blockade of the United States.\nInternational justice should be realized as soon as possible in the Palestine issue and in those countries and regions like Syria, Iraq and Libya that face the turbulence of war and violence owing to the unbridled interference of the United States in the internal affairs of sovereign States.\nThe covert political attempts of the United States and Western countries to infringe upon the sovereignty of independent African countries by abusing recourse to the International Criminal Court should be held in check. The double standard of the United States and its supporting Powers should be resolutely rejected; they politicize human rights issues to intentionally demonize the anti-imperialist and independent countries, and they misuse human rights as a tool of colour revolutions.\nIf the United Nations relinquishes justice, no country will place its hopes in the Organization. Any country that the United States regards as an antagonist and has targeted for regime change is automatically categorized as a country with human rights problems, without exception. That is the practice pursued at today\u2019s United Nations. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is one such country, but that only goes to show that we are an independent country that is against the United States and its supporting Powers. The United States raises the issue of our human rights because it is at a loss in dealing with the nuclear issue. If it is at a loss again as to what human rights question to pursue, it will take up another issue to continue its attempt to stifle the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. However, our people will never renounce socialism and the system of absolute service that they themselves have chosen, as a result of United States policies.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will push ahead with its vigorous struggle to remove the root cause of the threat of nuclear war imposed by the United States. This it will do by having a powerful nuclear deterrent, with a view to safeguarding peace and security on the Korean peninsula, and in Asia and the world at large, and to denuclearizing the world.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Philippine Government and the Filipino people, I wish to convey our warmest congratulations to Ambassador Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also wish to commend him for choosing a theme that resonates very well among Member States and partners. The theme, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, strongly reaffirms the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations.\nThe Philippines is one of the founding Members of the Organization. For more than seven decades, our engagement and partnership with the United Nations has been a riveting story of our aspirations as a people, born of our colonial past and our independent present. With its central and strategic role, the United Nations remains a relevant and important platform where all nations can make that decisive push to empower us all to achieve and sustain our development agenda, which has the interests of our peoples at its core.\nToday, the Philippines is once again privileged to renew its commitment to the cause of peace, security and sustainable development through key priority areas and advocacies identified in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The global action to transform our world illuminates the urgency and importance of our efforts in the Philippines to explore new horizons and break new ground, anchored in our unremitting commitment as a democracy to the rule of law and the well-being of our sovereign people and to our desire to remain a responsible partner in the international community.\nThe guiding principles and core values enshrined in the Constitution of the Philippines include the sanctity of human life, the inalienable rights of each person, the supremacy of the law, freedom, equality, peace, justice and the nation\u2019s right to self-determination. Among the country\u2019s mandates is the pursuit of an independent foreign policy designed to promote national interests. With our hard-fought and hard-won independence, we have valued and zealously guarded our rights and liberties. To prevent abuse and unwanted excesses, the checks and balances of our democratic institutions are actively at play. They range from the three highly independent branches of government \u2014 the Supreme Court, the Congress and the Executive Branch \u2014 to the open and free press and civil society groups committed to guaranteeing the freedom and prosperity of every Filipino.\nThose fundamental and time-honoured principles and values give rise to the solemn duty of our people to choose their leaders. In turn, the Government has the obligation to fervently defend the people\u2019s rights and liberties. Reneging on that responsibility places the Government at risk of being removed by popular initiatives, including People Power \u2014- a glorious event in the Philippines that is admired and remembered around the world.\nFive months ago, our people, through our nation\u2019s democratic principles and processes, elected a new leader. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte triumphed in the democratic elections with an unprecedented and resounding electoral mandate. The Filipino people, proud of their democratic values, traditions and heritage, have spoken. Their vote is an unmistakable call for a deepening of our democracy, where our people will truly be liberated from the shackles of fear, conflict, poverty and injustice. Their choice represents the expressed wish of the people to revitalize the entire country as a sovereign equal among the community of nations. Their sacred ballots cast an unequivocal and resounding voice for change and for tearing down antiquated political and economic structures that have continued to generate and perpetuate numerous inequalities. They voted for the renewal of our communities and our society, for a life of constancy, dignity and honour.\nIn his address to the nation, President Duterte declared that the rule of law and the respect for due process will prevail at all times. Clearly, we will be guided by established norms and procedures under the law to deliver on the strong mandate given to the President by the Filipino electorate.\nFor far too long, the Philippines has been unable to fully advance because of corruption in high and low places, the worsening crime situation and the prevalence of illegal drugs. Our people recognize the peril that those evils pose to our development and our democracy. Corruption has become the breeding ground for the illegal drug trade, which seriously threatens the country\u2019s peace and order. Furthermore, corruption impedes our sustainable development goals. It has torn apart many of our communities, destroyed families and snuffed out the hopes and dreams of our people, young and old, for a bright future. For that reason, we are determined to free the Philippines from corrupt and other outdated practices as we eradicate illicit drugs and their manufacture, distribution and use in the country. The rule of law and strict adherence to due process fully governs our campaign against corruption and criminality, including the fight against illegal drugs.\nOur firm belief in the supremacy of the law is given concrete expression through the State policy, enshrined in the Constitution, to fully respect human rights and the value and dignity of every person. We even have an independent Human Rights Commission tasked to investigate and prosecute all human rights violations in the country. That national commitment is amplified internationally, as the Philippines is party to eight of the nine core international human rights conventions. We recognize that a secure, stable, and prosperous Philippines will require a secure and stable rules-based international order to which it must faithfully comply.\nWith the imperative to forge policies for our people aimed at achieving enduring peace and prosperity and at restoring trust in the Government\u2019s ability to protect their fundamental rights and freedoms, the President, going into his third month in office, enjoys a 92 per cent rate of approval and trust from the Filipino people. To him, that trust is sacrosanct; under no circumstances can it be breached, under no circumstance must it be compromised.\nOur actions have, however, grabbed both national headlines and international attention for all the wrong reasons. Consequently, we urge everyone to allow us to deal with our domestic challenges so that we can achieve our national goals without undue interference and so that we can be among the community of nations that can collectively make a universal push to transform our world and improve the quality of life for all of humanity, including the more than 100 million Filipinos. We urge everyone to have faith in the strong institutions of our democracy and in our people to defend the freedom and integrity of our country, and in the power of our people as they continue to freely participate, be involved and have a say in the actions and decisions of their democratically elected Government.\nLet me repeat, explicitly and unequivocally, that the Philippines is committed to the rule of law and the protection of the rights of all Filipinos. With that abiding commitment, we are pursuing our efforts within the existing democratic and legal framework, whish is governed by the overriding principle to uphold the dignity of every person and the right to due process and to the presumption of innocence. For the law to be credible, respected and effective, it has to be consistent and fair. The full force of the law will be applied at all times to serve the ends of justice, and not just those of a select few. There will be no double standard, no application of selective justice.\nOur campaign to rid the country of criminality, lawlessness and disorder, including our all-out war against illicit drugs, will remain strictly in accordance with the Philippine Constitution and the international norms and human rights treaties and covenants that we are party to. We have not empowered and never will empower our law-enforcement agents to shoot to kill individuals suspected of drug crimes. And yet, under our established rules of engagement, our police have the right to defend themselves when their lives are threatened. Extrajudicial killing has no place in our society nor in our criminal justice system.\nOur sustainable goals rest on the fundamentals of development, that is, human development. The path of change that we seek is grounded in the most enduring of precepts, namely, our own national interest, which addresses the immediate needs of the Filipino people. Our goals are guided by our article of faith that we leave no one behind in our development strides. We are working hard to ensure that each and every Filipino will be able to keep in step with the overall development pace.\nThe Philippines continues to enhance the delivery and quality of basic social services to our people, anchored in the implementation of what we view as a human approach to development and governance. We have benchmarked such services to global standards. That is true of our health, education, food, water and housing services. Environmental preservation, respect for culture and the pursuit of social justice form key components of our national development frameworks.\nSince 2013, the Philippines has made public its support for the core pillars of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Philippines is honoured to be one of the 22 pioneer countries that volunteered at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development to share its initiatives in the first year of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nIf we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in 15 years, we need to take a risk-informed approach. It is axiomatic to say that frequent and intense natural disasters can negate our gains in the reduction of poverty and even push back development.\nThe Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries. It is also vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate, change owing to many years of neglect and selfish practices by various countries. This has left us far behind in progress, because of their irresponsibility and greed at our expense. We reiterate our call for climate justice and the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibility in the implementation of the obligations under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nThe Philippines will remain a responsible partner of the international community. Our domestic concerns compel us to partner with like-minded countries in the areas of maritime security, counter-terrorism, disaster response and transnational crime such as, but not limited to, trafficking in drugs and humans. Our commitment to the rule of law, peace, our people and our relations with the international community also extends to the recent decision of the Arbitral Tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague with regard to disputes in the South China Sea. The decision has upheld the primacy of international law as the cornerstone for a rules-based regional and international order. The arbitral award, which is final and binding on all parties, is a clearly established legal fact that is now part of international jurisprudence in the maritime domain, in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nWe reaffirm our abiding commitment to pursue the peaceful resolution and management of disputes with a view to promoting and enhancing peace and stability in the region. We need to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes as we explore the best way forward. We reaffirm the need to enhance mutual trust and confidence. We must not overlook the importance of non-militarization and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities, including maintaining the freedom of navigation, the full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the adoption of an effective code of conduct.\nOver the past 71 years, the United Nations has demonstrated continuing resilience and relevance in the face of intractable challenges and emerging regional threats, both traditional and non-traditional. With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations has rightly returned development to the centre of global efforts to pursue peace, security and stability.\nThe Philippines, as a founding Member of the United Nations, walks with and works with the community of nations in truly transforming our world, where the universal values of equality, tolerance and human dignity must prevail. As we reason together in this honoured Hall of the United Nations, let us together move our development goals forward. For us to build our future, we must honour our past. As we reaffirm our common humanity, we have to keep faith with one another as we advance our noblest and highest aspirations based on our collective will and pursue our varying and often disparate national interests.\nDespite the odds and the complex challenges, we must press on, with courage and fortitude, for the sake of our peoples and seize the promise of a better tomorrow for future generations. Let us not forget \u2014 to borrow the words of a distinguished member of humankind \u2014 that in our determination to transform the world, it is not enough to see things as they are and ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Let us all dream of things that never were and ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "At this seventy- first session, it is indeed an honour to see a fellow Pacific islander elected for the first time as President of the General Assembly. Mr. Peter Thomson brings to the position qualities of experience, personality and leadership that are known in this Hall. Solomon Islands would like to assure him of our support and cooperation during his term in office, and we look forward to working with him on our common agenda as one of his Vice-Presidents.\nOur appreciation goes to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose term in office coincided with the adoptions of three development frameworks \u2014 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. President Lykketoft worked tirelessly to strengthen the role and authority of the General Assembly. He put in place an open, inclusive and transparent process for selecting the Secretary-General, and our new Secretary-General is expected to take up office in January 2017. For the first time in 70 years, I believe, the Assembly interacted with all the candidates for the position. We wish all of them the best in their bid for the position and leave an open invitation to the incoming Secretary-General to consider visiting the Hapi Isles.\nMr. Ban Ki-moon\u2019s tenure as Secretary-General comes to a close at the end of this year. We join others in paying tribute to his exemplary leadership of our Organization. Over the years, he has worked for the benefit of all and has been a voice of reason, particularly on the issue of climate change. He remains the first and only Secretary-General to visit Solomon Islands since we joined this body 38 years ago. It was also during his tenure that the United Nations country presence in Solomon Islands was upgraded. We have every confidence that his successor can further upgrade that presence to the status of a full-fledged country office. We remain steadfast in our commitment to working with the Secretary-General during the remaining four months of his term and thank him for his sterling service to Solomon Islands and humankind.\nLast year was one of agreements and the adoption of frameworks; this year must be about operationalizing the agreements and implementing the frameworks. In that regard, Solomon Islands welcomes the theme of this session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. We commend the President for putting together an SDG implementation team in his Office and look forward to working with him on unlocking the means of implementation so as to realize full and effective implementation of the SDGs. I am indeed proud to say that Solomon Islands has begun the work of domesticating the Sustainable Development Goals by integrating them into our national development strategy for 2016 to 2035, which provides a clear, coherent and harmonized whole-of- Government approach to delivering on our national policies and programmes.\nThe high-level meetings held this week to address the issue of large movements of refugees and migrants were also an opportunity to seriously examine the issue of climate-displaced populations and environmental migrants. The international community must do more by establishing a global mechanism to help small island developing States (SIDS) manage populations displaced by climate change. The treaties in effect are inadequate to addressing the issue of people forced out by climate change. We call for a legal framework designed to address and protect the rights of forced climate migrants and to compensate populations affected by climate change for the loss of their livelihoods.\nSolomon Islands is the current Chair of the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF), which is a bold attempt to address the issues of sustainable development through a structured and inclusive approach, under the tripartite leadership of Government, the private sector and civil society. The PIDF offers the Pacific island countries a seamless link to the high-level political forum processes envisaged under \u201cThe future we want\u201d.\nSolomon Islands welcomes the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and I would like to congratulate the French presidency of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference for its leadership in helping to restore trust and confidence in the multilateral system. We now have the Paris Agreement, with legally binding obligations to implement the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). I am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands has ratified the Agreement and submitted its instrument of ratification two days ago. We are all duty-bound to strengthen the Agreement and make it work.\nHowever, we remain concerned about the fact that ambitions under the Paris Agreement remain alarmingly low if we are to limit warming to well below 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We appeal to developed countries to scale up the ambition of their intended nationally determined contributions so as to protect the integrity of the Paris Agreement. We hope that in Marrakech we will be able to do more to establish the Agreement on firmer foundations by taking concrete steps to close the pre-2020 ambition gap. We therefore urge countries that have not ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to do so as soon as possible.\nI also welcome the decision taken in December by the parties to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons under the treaty. We hope that big emitters and industrial countries will see the urgency of preventing runaway climate change and will ratify the Paris Agreement to enable its entry into force as soon as possible.\nThis year, scientists reported that five of our islands had been claimed by the sea as a result of human-induced sea-level rise, while six others were severely eroded. Accelerating sea-level rise and ocean acidification continue to be serious concerns for us. Delaying action on tackling climate change comes at a cost, and we in the SIDS and least-developed countries are unnecessarily put in harm\u2019s way by the lack of commitment on the part of some.\nSolomon Islands welcomes and supports the initiative of the Moroccan presidency of the twenty- second session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in convening a facilitative dialogue on unlocking the means of implementation to operationalize the Paris Agreement. We also welcome the decision of the Green Climate Fund to disburse $2.5 billion by December 2016. Solomon Islands is in the midst of securing financing from the Fund for one of our hydropower projects. We continue to be grateful to partners such as Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Italy and the Republic of China for their ongoing renewable energy assistance to Solomon Islands.\nI am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands has just deployed five police officers for United Nations peacekeeping duties. We intend to step up our efforts to meet our global responsibility and send more officers to other missions abroad in the near future. On the regional front, Solomon Islands would like to express its gratitude to all 15 members of the Pacific Islands Forum, including Australia and New Zealand, for their steadfast partnership and commitment to Solomon Islands over the past 13 years. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) is winding down and will withdraw in June 2017. Solomon Islands is engaging with various partners, including Australia and New Zealand, on post-RAMSI arrangements.\nSolomon Islands remains committed to Sustainable Development Goal 16. We have conducted national reconciliation outreach and would like to thank the United Nations for making peacebuilding funds available for use in Solomon Islands. We are currently undertaking legislative and land reforms, including nation-building economic investments. We are committed to unifying our culturally richly diverse population.\nOn the issue of the oceans, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Solomon Islands is developing a national ocean governance framework that will rationalize and enhance coordination and the implementation of all ocean-related legislation. Solomon Islands has some of the world\u2019s most diverse marine species and is a member of the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI). The Initiative affords us a coordinated approach to marine and coastal management with Government leadership and a focus on people-centred natural-resource management We are mindful of the growing global attention to the oceans and welcome the Assembly\u2019s decision to convene a United Nations conference on oceans and seas next year. Solomon Islands also supports the establishment of a new agreement to deal with biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nThere is no single ocean entry point in the multilateral system, and I call for the establishment of a world ocean authority. Such an authority would coordinate all ocean-related treaties, entities and programmes, and move beyond the current sectoral approach to a single holistic and comprehensive framework.\nFisheries contribute significantly to the economies of the Pacific. Tuna has served to integrate the economies of the Pacific into global markets. This year the Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) celebrated Tuna Day here at the United Nations. I hope that it becomes an annual event, and we will explore the possibility of bringing a draft resolution to the General Assembly to declare 2 May as World Tuna Day.\nSolomon Islands is a party to the Nauru Agreement on Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest. We believe in a rights-based approach to fisheries management that guarantees resource owners their fair share of the benefits. The Vessel Day Scheme is one such rights-based mechanism. It has significantly increased the economic returns from our tuna.\nI am pleased to note that one of Solomon Islands\u2019 four continental-shelf claims submitted to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf is now awaiting decision by the Commission. The joint claim of the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands to the Ontong Java Plateau was considered by a subcommission in August. Solomon Islands would like to acknowledge the efforts of the joint delegation and thank the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for its assistance from its trust fund. We encourage all who are blessed with resources to contribute to the fund. I also thank the Commonwealth Secretariat for the technical support rendered to the joint delegation, and hope that similar support can be extended to the remaining claims.\nSolomon Islands recognizes the fundamental rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its 23 million people to participate meaningfully in the United Nations specialized agencies. Solomon Islands finds Taiwan\u2019s limited and restricted participation with the World Health Organization system regrettable, especially at a time when the spread of infectious diseases is impacting our children, and we need everyone to assist. We call for Taiwan\u2019s open and free access to all World Health Organization meetings. Similarly, Taiwan remains unjustly on the fringes of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) decision-making processes, Taiwan manages more than 1 million flights, equalling 58 million passengers, through the Taipei Flight Information Region. We also call for Taiwan\u2019s predictable and certain participation in ICAO meetings. There have always been two political systems along the Taiwan Strait. The reality is that the world works with one and turns a blind eye to the other. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for all hands on deck. Let us put the interests of humankind first and work with all, including Taiwan.\nThe year 2016 is Solomon Islands\u2019 second year as Chair of the five-member Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG). The Group has established the subregional Humanitarian and Emergency Response Coordination Centre so as to be able to respond to disasters in our subregion. The increasing occurrence of severe tropical cyclones requires timely international and regional responses in order to complement nationally led disaster- management responses. The Group recently concluded negotiations on a new MSG trade agreement. The new agreement, once signed by the five States, will deepen and tighten economic integration among the member States. The Group continues to follow the question of New Caledonia, which is on the United Nations agenda. We wish the people of New Caledonia all the best as they prepare to decide on their political future in 2018.\nSolomon Islands reaffirms its support for the inalienable right of the people of the territory of French Polynesia to self-determination, pursuant to the annual resolutions of the General Assembly, beginning in 2013 (resolution 67/265). Solomon Islands continues to request the Administrative Power to work and cooperate with the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization on the question of French Polynesia, and we hope that the Special Committee will visit the territory soon.\nSolomon Islands is gravely concerned about the human rights violations against Melanesians in West Papua. Human rights violations in West Papua and West Papua\u2019s pursuit of self-determination are two sides of the same coin. The many reports of human rights violations in West Papua corroborate the practice of direct violations of human rights by Indonesia in its attempts to smother any form of opposition.\nThe principle of sovereignty is paramount in any institution whose core rationale is the respect for sovereignty. If, however, the justification of sovereignty rests on a series of decisions that are questionable, then there is a case to challenge the legality of the argument for sovereignty, as outlined in the Agreement signed in New York on 15 August 1962 and the Act of Free Choice. Solomon Islands adds its voice to those of other Member States and civil-society organizations that are concerned about human rights violations in the Papua and West Papua regions of Indonesia. As the Chair of the MSG, which includes Indonesia as an associate member and the United Liberation Movement of West Papua as an observer, Solomon Islands affirms the need for constructive engagement with Indonesia and looks forward to cooperating with Indonesia to address the violations of human rights in West Papua.\nSolomon Islands welcomes the restoration of relations between Cuba and the United States of America. Solomon Islands continues to call on its friend and partner the United States of America to work towards completely lifting the embargo. On South-South cooperation, I would like to register my appreciation to Cuba for the medical scholarships offered to our students, and I am pleased to see the growing number of graduates returning to serve our people.\nThe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains a source of guidance and inspiration on gender equality and gender empowerment. Solomon Islands remains committed to the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Platform for Action, which should enable the realization of gender goals and targets under the Sustainable Development Goals. In April of this year, my Government welcomed the entry into force of the Family Protection Act. My Government\u2019s continued legal-reform programme will result in laws that complement the functions of the Family Protection Act.\nA reform of the Security Council remains elusive. We urge the Assembly to build on the work carried out at the previous session to make the Council more accountable, representative and transparent. Solomon Islands and fellow SIDS continue to seek a dedicated seat for SIDS in the non-permanent-seat category in the Council.\nIn conclusion, the journey to implement the SDGs has begun. The Assembly will be measured by our success in unlocking the means, tools and resources to transform our peoples\u2019 lives and ensure them a sustainable future. Let us not fail our people.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government and my people, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\nThis will be the last General Assembly at which His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon will serve the peoples of the world as Secretary-General. I wish to now place on record my country\u2019s great appreciation of his stewardship of our affairs. The task of the Secretary-General is not easy. Occupied with trying to resolve conflicts around the world, stop bloodshed, mediate diverse positions between Governments, address hunger and malnutrition, uphold human rights, including the rights of women, refugees and vulnerable communities, work tirelessly to secure peace and ensure development in its widest meaning. All of that is deeply challenging and enormously worrisome. Managing it all involves exhausting travel, the neglect of family responsibilities, and wearisome nights without sleep. Therefore, on behalf of my people, I wish to record our deep appreciation for all of the Secretary-General\u2019s unstinting efforts.\nI thank him particularly for the 10 years of diligence that he has devoted to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which our Governments adopted in September 2015. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice and tackle climate change by 2030 are of vital interest to the well-being of small countries, such as mine. Of course, we are disappointed that many of the Goals remain aspirational and lack a legally binding commitment to the funding that is crucial for their implementation. But we are realistic enough not to reject the good just because we did not get the perfect. We will continue to advocate for fairness and equity in the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nMy small island State is also grateful to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his conscientiousness in promoting an agreement on climate change, which our nations collectively signed in Paris last year. My Government was pleased to deposit its instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change earlier this week at here at Headquarters. I urge the countries that have not yet signed or ratified the Agreement to do so without delay. Time is not on our side.\nI remind the representatives of all nations gathered in this Hall that the present pledges to reduce emissions are still insufficient to limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0 Celsius and to build climate resilience. At a rise of 1.5\u00b0 Celsius, many of our countries \u2014 or parts of them \u2014 will still be washed away. Temperatures continue to rise, as the bell is tolling.\nThe bell may be tolling for small islands, but in the words of the poet John Donne, \u201cit also tolls for thee\u201d. The ravages of climate change will not end with the erosion of small island States, nor will its consequences disappear with the last surging tide. Its refugees, its displaced people and the misery of its effects will wash up on the shores of those who dismiss or neglect the issue today.\nOur small countries endure the problems caused by climate change not because we created it, but because we are the victims of the polluting profligacy of others. But we are not content to simply wring our hands in anguish or throw up our arms in despair. We are keen to help provide solutions. That is why my Government has repeatedly proposed debt swaps for climate-change adaptation and mitigation. Many of our small island States are burdened by high debt because we are denied access to concessionary financing and are forced to borrow at high commercial rates to rebuild after disasters and to mitigate against them. High debt is not only a drag on our economic growth; it constrains our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We are caught in a very vicious cycle.\nWe have proposed that we be provided with soft loans to stop further high debt accumulation while we build resilience to global warming and sea-level rise. However, for us to qualify for soft loans, the international financial institutions and donor Governments must stop using per capita income as a criterion. So far, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Beyond the facade of high per capita income is our increasing poverty, high levels of household and individual vulnerability, acute issues in health and education and worrying rates of unemployment, especially among youth. High per capita income distorts the reality that, because of the openness of our small economies and our dependence on foreign investment, a minority of the population earns the largest percentage of income, leaving the majority at subsistence level and below.\nThose facts are known to international financial institutions and those who govern them, yet they are ignored. The more appropriate criteria for allowing access to concessionary financing should be our very well-known vulnerability to shocks that are generated from outside our shores and over which we have no control. The cost to institutions, such as the World Bank, of refining their criteria would not be very high, but such access would represent a significant measure enabling our small countries to improve our economic performance.I have to admit a deep sense of frustration and disappointment that, year after year, other Heads of Government of small States and I have come to the Assembly and explained the challenges that confront us, but to no avail. We remain trapped in the reality of a narrow tax base, high debt, large trade deficits, small underdeveloped domestic financial markets, small private sectors and fragile banking systems. I remind the Assembly of Albert Einstein\u2019s observation:\n\u201cIn matters of truth and justice, there is no difference between large and small problems, for issues concerning the treatment of people are all the same.\u201d\nThe truth of the situation facing small States is obvious to all; so too should be the need for justice. My country, having resumed negotiations with the Government of the United States on the outstanding World Trade Organization matter, looks forward to a speedy resolution as we continue to find innovative ways to build our country.\nIn terms of the grave challenges to the economic viability facing my country and the Caribbean region, I can now point to an urgent and existential threat of considerable relevance to our survival. The latest challenge that our countries face is the decision by global banks to discontinue correspondent banking relations with our financial institutions. In the international campaign against money laundering and terrorist financing, very strict penalties have been imposed on banks by regulatory bodies in North America and Europe for any infringement of the stringent regulations.\nIn that environment, where even the slightest infraction could expose a bank to a fine of hundreds of millions of dollars, many banks have chosen to withdraw essential correspondent banking relations from financial institutions in the Caribbean, Central America and Africa. They call that process \u201cde-risking\u201d. I call it economic destruction. It is now prevalent in the Caribbean, but it also exists in parts of Africa and Central America. It will spread, with global consequences, unless it is curbed through collective action.\nAll those countries, including mine, are now at the point of losing vital correspondent banking relationships. The consequences would be calamitous. We would be severed from the world\u2019s trading system, unable to pay for basic goods and services that we purchase or to receive payments for goods and services that we sell to other countries. Remittances from our diaspora would be cut off, causing more of the population to depend on social welfare at a time when our economies are already under great stress.\nIn other words, a growing cancer is eating away at development \u2014 a cancer that is threatening the stability of our region and denying us the right to participate in the international economy. But that is not all. Since the consequence of being cut off from the world trading system would be economic collapse, not only would poverty and crime dramatically increase, so too would the very global scourges that every nation fears \u2014 an increase in refugees and human trafficking.\nThe consequences would not be limited to our countries. Worse yet, financial transactions that are now regulated and monitored by law enforcement agencies would be forced underground, creating huge opportunities for money laundering and terrorism financing. That would undermine the global, multilateral cooperation that is required to fight those scourges. And it is important to be aware of the fact that, in all the money laundering and terrorism financing cases that have been prosecuted in the world, not one of them involved a Caribbean financial institution.\nDe-risking is a substantial matter; its far-reaching consequences could create fundamental problems for our countries. The threat that we face in the Caribbean is real; the danger is imminent. But, make no mistake, no country will be immune from its consequences if it is left unchecked.\nI am grateful to the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Ms. Christine Lagarde, for her timely and important statement made on 18 July at the New York Federal Reserve, in which she said,\n\u201cI am concerned that not all is well in this world of small countries with small financial systems. In fact, there is a risk that they become more marginalized.\u201d\nShe went on to say that\n\u201call actors have a part to play: countries need to upgrade their regulatory frameworks; regulators in key financial centres need to clarify regulatory expectations and ensure consistent application over time; and global banks need to avoid knee-jerk reactions and find sensible ways to reduce their costs. There is a lot at stake. For both the big and the small. For all of us.\u201d\nMs. Lagarde could not be more right, and her summons to the international community should be a clarion call to all.\nIn the case of the Caribbean, my colleagues the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community mandated me to convene a high-level conference on that matter to address it in a holistic fashion. It will be held in Antigua on 27 and 28 October, and I have already issued invitations to key global stakeholders.. Our objective at that conference will be to work collectively to end that huge threat to the well-being of our region. We are acting responsibly, and I call on the General Assembly to recognize the substantial and dangerous nature of this issue, and to join us in addressing it constructively.\nOur nations operate in the United Nations system in the context of some kind of global order. It is a global order that is supposed to be underpinned by the Charter of the United Nations. Reference is often made to the first goal cited in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, which is \u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\u201d.\nIt is of course right that we should do so. For even though that principle is enshrined in the Charter and is legally binding on all Member States, conflict and carnage continue in several parts of the world, particularly the Middle East. And, as the Secretary- General lamented in his presentation of his report on the work of the Organization (A/71/1) to this session of the General Assembly, \u201cPowerful patrons who keep feeding the war machine also have blood on their hands.\u201d (see A/71/PV.8).\nBut, at least in recent years, wars have been reduced and isolated. In that regard, the commitment of States to the Charter has made our world a safer place for the majority of our people.\nHowever, it is the other three goals in the Preamble that our nations have yet to meet. And because of that failure, developing countries and small States such as mine remain marginalized, outside the bounty of the world. I remind everyone of those three goals:\n\u201cTo reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and\n\u201cTo establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and\n\u201cTo promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d.\nThe global order under which we live and conduct our relations pays only lip service to those principles and ideals. That is why Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba is still occupied by the United States and the United States embargo on that country continues, despite the wishes of the people and the Government of Cuba. That is why bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club for rich countries, Unilaterally make rules on financial matters, which they impose on other countries, which have no say. That is why powerful countries brand regions in the Caribbean and Pacific as tax havens, with all the negative and harmful consequences that such branding entails. That is why the Caribbean region can be arbitrarily and unfairly severed from vital correspondent banking relationships. That is why countries such as mine have no voice of our own and no vote in the decision-making councils of the international financial institutions that make and implement the rules that materially affect our lives.\n\u201cMight is right\u201d continues to be the principle underpinning the mentality of the powerful. But our world cannot be free from poverty, conflict, terror, inequity and injustice while the powerful take advantage of the weak. In the words of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d It is time that the global order recognize that self-evident truth.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me a great pleasure to join the cordial congratulations on the well-deserved election of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We are confident that his wisdom, diplomatic experience and skill will contribute to the success of the current session, and my delegation would like to assure him of its full cooperation to that end. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his able leadership during the previous session.\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his tireless efforts during his two terms in promoting global peace and security, development and well-being for all peoples of the world. His competent and effective leadership has been a positive force in reforming the Secretariat, easing crises and disputes, addressing current and emerging challenges and elaborating a new agenda on sustainable development and climate change. For all of those efforts, I would like to convey the sincere gratitude of the people of the Republic of Tajikistan.\nThe year 2015 was momentous because of the adoption of a number of key documents aimed at strengthening the global development agenda. Those documents are interrelated and will define the path of our development in the coming decades. However, we have been less successful in addressing issues affecting international peace and security. Armed conflicts continue to pose a growing threat in various regions of the world. Destructive and inhumane forces of terrorism and extremism have been gaining power by attracting into their orbits ever-increasing numbers of youth, thereby seriously undermining efforts to maintain security and peaceful development.\nCombating international terrorism and extremism has become a top priority. There is a need to develop national, regional and international mechanisms aimed at eliminating military infrastructure, channels for financial and logistical support, recruitment and violent propaganda, including counteracting the use of modern Internet and computer technology for terrorism purposes. Moreover, it is essential that we jointly seek ways of addressing the issue of poverty, the negative impact of globalization, and conflict prevention and settlement. There is also a need to strengthen intercultural and interfaith dialogue, mutual trust and tolerance. In that context, the United Nations remains the key platform for achieving consensus on the main issues of international security and development and for coordinating joint action by the international community in addressing the challenges and threats of today.\nEliminating illicit drug trafficking, which has become a breeding ground for terrorism and organized crime, requires the joint and concerted actions of the entire international community. We believe that the fight against drug trafficking is an essential part of the fight against organized crime, terrorism and extremism, and we reaffirm that international cooperation on drug control will remain a priority of the Government of Tajikistan. The special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem, held in April 2016, provided a unique opportunity for seeking new and additional ways of strengthening cooperation in combating the root causes of the drug problem and dealing with its consequences. During its membership on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, Tajikistan will continue its cooperation with donor countries and international organizations, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in order to implement the outcome document of the special session resolution S-30/1, annex).\nTajikistan stands for a comprehensive settlement of the crises in the Middle East, which will contribute to enhancing global security. We therefore support international and regional efforts aimed at restoring and strengthening peace and stability in the Middle East, including the efforts to resume and accelerate credible negotiations under the Middle East peace process.\nTajikistan supports the international strategy for a comprehensive settlement and post-conflict reconstruction in Afghanistan. We need to strengthen our support to the Government of Afghanistan, especially during Afghanistan\u2019s transformation decade 2015-2024. It is important for Afghanistan to become involved in the process of regional integration by strengthening its economic and trade ties with its neighbouring countries. We call for the expansion of targeted assistance to Afghanistan aimed at economic rehabilitation, the strengthening of its social conditions and the creation of new jobs in its economy. We are ready to take part in rehabilitating the social and economic infrastructure of Afghanistan by connecting the transport arteries of our two countrie by creating an energy bridge known as CASA-1000, and providing the Afghan population with essential commodities and training for specialists.\nWe are at the beginning of a transformation process that started with the setting of a new agenda that reflects the hopes and desires of every one of us for a decent and secure future. It is obvious that the path to sustainable development will be neither easy nor smooth. At the same time, our political will should be reinforced by adequate means of implementation. There is a need to mobilize additional financial resources, including official development assistance, which is the main component in financing development. Under the current circumstances, it is essential to revitalize international trade and investments, which are the main engines of productive growth, and encourage and promote transfers of innovative and ecologically sound technologies.\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda also requires clear and transparent mechanisms to follow up and review both progress and problems. As a new and first-time member of the Economic and Social Council, Tajikistan is willing to do its part in strengthening and coordinating the efforts to address the complex issues of achieving sustainable development. In our endeavours to achieve sustainable development, we need to remember our collective determination to lend a hand to countries that are confronted with difficulties. We need to remember that a number of countries will begin their implementation of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in unfavourable conditions. In particular, there is a need to provide support to countries in special situations, especially the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.\nAccess to modern and cost-efficient energy services is key to achieving sustainable development. Tajikistan actively supports the Secretary-General\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All initiative and the United Nations 2014- 2024 Decade of Sustainable Energy for All.\nI would like to emphasize that the 2030 Agenda regards water as the most essential element of life and the main component of development. That is a\n16-29811 35/52 positive shift, which makes the new water agenda more comprehensive and integrated by comparison with the previous water agenda, framed within the Millennium Development Goals. In that regard, we should take into consideration the fact that climate change, as well as the processes of urbanization and population growth, will certainly exacerbate any challenges. In addition, as a result of climate change, water shortages in many parts of the world will increase owing, first of all, to a reduction in the scale of glaciers and the snowpack. For instance, in Tajikistan during the past 35 to 40 years more than 1,000 massive glaciers out of a total of 13,000 have melted completely. That melting of glaciers and ice caps has caused increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters and the deterioration of ecosystems, which have translated to significant financial and material losses for the national economy and, unfortunately, have caused human casualties.\nNevertheless, the new water agenda is achievable. We have observed that significant progress can be made when countries and regions commit to prioritizing water challenges. What is clear is that countries and the international community as a whole must work together and undertake coordinated efforts and adopt both urgent and long-term measures. That is particularly true when water is shared among various sectors \u2014 health, agriculture, energy and navigation, for example \u2014 or when surface and groundwater are shared among communities and between countries.\nThose were among the issues related to the implementation of the global water agenda discussed at the High-level Symposium on SDG 6 and Targets: Ensuring that No One Is Left Behind in Access to Water and Sanitation, held in Dushanbe on 9 and 10 August and jointly organized by the Government of Tajikistan, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and various United Nations agencies. The Symposium provided a platform for a balanced discussion of policy measures, actions and the means to fast-track the implementation of the water-related SDGs and targets. It adopted a call for action that invites the international community to deepen its cooperation at all levels to address emerging water issues, to improve capacity in the implementation and monitoring of integrated water resources management and to support an International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d, 2018-2028.\nI would like to express our sincere gratitude to all Member States for their active participation in the Symposium. I hope that the members of the Assembly will also support the proposed International Decade, which will strengthen and enhance the progress achieved during the previous International Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, 2005-2015, and will create a solid platform for the consolidation of our efforts aimed at the sustainable management of water resources in the post-2015 period. The proposed International Decade will complement other initiated mechanisms, notably the High-level Panel on 2030 Global Water Architecture, and it can serve to fill any gaps that may arise in the implementation of new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n"

        "file_text": "I belong to a generation that was born into a globalized world. For us, globalization is not a threat \u2014 it is a fact of life. As Kofi Annan once said, arguing against globalization is like arguing against the laws of gravity. Let us be clear: the fact that the world has grown closer together has brought about enormous benefits. It has reduced international poverty, contributed to the spread of technology and reduced the distances between countries.\nBut we must also recognize that globalization has not only led to positive consequences; it also created new challenges. Events taking place on the other side of the globe can have a direct impact on our lives. That includes not only in the economic world, but in all spheres of life. Especially in recent years, we have seen a dramatic increase in threats to stability throughout the world.\nWhen I started out as Foreign Minister, in December 2013, Ukraine had full sovereignty over its eastern borders and Crimea. The Iraqi Government was still in control of Mosul and other parts of the country, and religious minorities, such as the Yazidis, still lived in peace and security in their homeland. Yet today, thinking in terms of confrontational blocs has returned to Europe. Today Da\u2019esh threatens whole States, and radicalization and violent extremism are on the rise worldwide.\nGiven those developments, I can understand that people are shocked and overburdened by the many images they see of violence, suffering and destruction, and that they would wish to block those images from their living rooms. But the truth is that, while one can turn off the television and block off the news from one\u2019s home, what cannot be changed in a globalized world is the fact that something taking place elsewhere can have a direct impact on our lives. The more interconnected our world becomes, the greater the responsibility of each one of us is to not ignore events taking place in other parts of the world. The more globalized our world becomes, the more interest each one of us must take in strengthening stability and prosperity in other parts of the world, not only out of solidarity but also out of self-interest.\nOne thing is very clear today: we all need to join forces. We need the United Nations, the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). And we need effective multilateralism to achieve what we most desire, namely, security and stability.\nToday threats to security and stability arise from many challenges at the same time. The destruction caused by military conflicts is increasing, violent extremism is growing and weapons of mass destruction still exist. The conflict that is closest to us in Austria is the one in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. We remain very concerned, because the Minsk Agreement has still not been implemented, and progress has been frustratingly slow. In our opinion, we need to find solutions beyond the ceasefires. We need a free and stable Ukraine that has good relations with both the Russian Federation and the European Union.\nTo achieve greater security, we must rebuild trust. In that respect, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which reaches from Vancouver to Vladivostok, is uniquely placed to promote stability and security. During Austria\u2019s chairmanship of the OSCE in 2017, we intend to contribute to rebuilding trust and defusing conflicts in the OSCE area, such as in eastern Ukraine, Georgia, Nagorno Karabakh and Transnistria. But we are also faced with a ring of instability in Europe\u2019s wider neighbourhood \u2014 in Syria, Iraq and Libya.\nOn Syria, we need to reinforce diplomatic efforts to establish a ceasefire, enable safe access for humanitarian aid and start a political process. That is the only way to end the ongoing humanitarian crisis in that long-suffering country. We are outraged by the attacks on medical facilities and aid convoys. Let me be clear: all of those who committed crimes against civilians must be brought to justice.\nAround the globe, radicalization and violent extremism pose serious threats to our societies, undermining security, development, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We must all realize that acts of religious extremism do not happen only in areas of conflict; there are religious extremists who radicalize our youth even in the heart of our own societies. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have joined the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in order to rape, kill and try to exterminate religious minorities in other parts of the world. They include more than 5,000 people from the EU, among them 300 from Austria. We cannot accept that our citizens commit such crimes in other parts of the world, and we have to be clear that when they return, they pose a major threat to our societies. We therefore have to increase efforts within our communities to prevent young people from being misled by those who abuse religion.\nWe also have to remain committed in our fight against Da\u2019esh and other terrorist groups in countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya, because destroying Da\u2019esh would be the most powerful measure to counter radicalization. The more we deny radical terrorists their success stories, the fewer new fighters will be recruited from other parts of the world. If we are unsuccessful in that fight, we will see increased radicalization and terrorism worldwide, with no safe havens, neither in Europe nor elsewhere.\nIn an ever less secure world facing ever greater tensions among the major Powers, nuclear disarmament remains the number one unfinished business. The recent nuclear tests by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea serve as a warning sign. We all agree that the humanitarian consequences of a nuclear-weapon explosion would be unacceptable. We must therefore finally rid ourselves of all nuclear weapons. Experience shows that the first step in eliminating weapons of mass destruction is to prohibit them through legally binding norms. Together with other Member States, Austria will submit a draft resolution to convene negotiations on a legally binding comprehensive instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons in 2017.\nBut that is not enough. We also need to put an end to the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. When such weapons are used in cities and other urban areas \u2014 as we have seen in Syria \u2014 more than 90 per cent of the victims are civilians. The destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure forces people to leave. The world would be a safer place without such weapons, especially for children, women and elderly people. We will therefore convene a meeting in early October to promote that goal, and we hope for Members\u2019 support.\nThe United Nations is central when it comes to tackling the global challenges of our time. We need an effective guardian for our shared values and principles. We need a strong United Nations to provide security, achieve stability and restore people\u2019s confidence. In that context, I would like to express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership during his two terms at the United Nations. His moral leadership has made it possible to achieve success, inter alia, through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Let me assure all of those present that Austria will remain committed to supporting the United Nations and its goals, both as a Member State and as the host country to one of its headquarters.\n"

Mexico has always been a staunch ally of the United Nations and a nation that firmly believes in its transformative power. From this Hall, vital collective efforts have been undertaken in pursuit of humankind\u2019s noblest causes.\nFor over seven decades, global voices have called for a better future. Each generation has taken on the challenges of its time with determination. It is incumbent upon us to continue in the same spirit to confront the enormous challenge of making sustainable development of the planet a reality. We have already taken the first step in that direction, specifically by defining the Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we formulated and agreed on here at the United Nations, is without a doubt the boldest, noblest and most demanding action plan that the international community has adopted in recent history. It is a road map for national and subnational Governments, just as it is for all of society\u2019s stakeholders that have the mission of improving the lives of billions of people and leaving no one behind. Because of its scope and goals, the 2030 Agenda is the framework that harmonizes the agreements reached last year in the areas of human rights, environment and sustainable peace.\nWhat have the national efforts of Mexico been in this arena? First of all, we have taken on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda as a national commitment. Along the same lines, work is under way to establish a high-level council for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, which will be headed by the President of the republic. Its purpose will be to coordinate the work of the various stakeholders, including local authorities, lawmakers, and representatives of civil society, academia and the private sector. Mexico has also set up a specialized technical committee composed of the main federal institutions, tasked with measuring and monitoring the Agenda\u2019s indicators. Similarly, we are creating a public monitoring dashboard in order to transparently share our successes and remaining challenges with the public. As part of that commitment to transparency and accountability, Mexico was one of the 22 countries that on 19 July presented their voluntary national review documents to the high-level political forum.\nMexico is also committed to promoting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the regional level. In April next year we will chair the Forum of the Countries of Latin American and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development. Given that human rights are now a cross-cutting element in the 2030 Agenda, my country has adopted a national social inclusion strategy focused on ensuring the full enjoyment of social rights, thereby reducing poverty and increasing equality.\nWe applaud the recognition in the 2030 Agenda of migrants as subjects of rights and as vital allies in the development of their countries of destination and origin. As I stated yesterday at the plenary meeting (see A/71/ PV.4B), Mexico will work actively for the creation of agreements on migration and refugees. To that end, we have offered to host an international preparatory meeting for reaching a better definition of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In the face of these challenges, we should leave behind our indifference and promote the shared responsibility and joint action of the international community with regard to migrants and refugees.\nAnother cross-cutting theme of the 2030 Agenda is gender perspective and the empowerment of women. In keeping with the commitments of last year\u2019s Global Leaders\u2019 Meeting on Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment: A Commitment to Action, Mexico now has a more robust institutional framework in its national system for equality between women and men. The fact that that system is headed by Mexico\u2019s President ensures that the policy of equality is upheld at the highest level and is reflected in the national Government\u2019s actions.\nAdditionally, driven by a sense of urgency, Mexico has adopted the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. A few days ago my country\u2019s Ssenate ratified that international treaty, which will be submitted for entry into force at tomorrow\u2019s high-level meeting. Our priority now is to develop national mechanisms to coordinate, verify and report on compliance with the commitments assumed under that agreement.\nWe must henceforward change the way we live, produce and consume. We must harmonize economic development with social inclusion and environmental protection. One example of that balance can be seen in my country\u2019s energy reform, which includes a law of energy transition whereby, by 2018, 25 per cent of its electric energy will be generated using clean sources, reaching 70 per cent by 2040. Similarly, at the regional level, the three North American nations have committed to reducing our oil and gas sectors\u2019 methane emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2025.\nAs part of its global responsibility to the environment, Mexico will host the thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, to be held in December. That forum seeks to align actions to protect and preserve our natural heritage with the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and those of the 2030 Agenda. By the same token, next year we will host the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, which will assess the first two years of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and will set goals for reducing and mitigating development risks.\nThirdly, Mexico has reaffirmed its pacifist vocation and its commitment to achieving sustainable global peace. The international community has confirmed that the stability of countries affected by armed conflict depends not only on their security conditions, but also on their respect for human rights, on the effectiveness of their institutions and the rule of law, and on their ability to foster inclusive development. This cross- cutting vision is fully in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. In that regard, the Goals are key to preventing and avoiding social and political crises and will also be crucial to finding peaceful solutions to the armed conflicts in many countries.\nThe most recent example is the peace agreement reached in Colombia. Mexico applauds that achievement, and we will show our solidarity with the attainment of its goals. Similarly, in the pursuit of reduced tension and greater understanding in our region, Mexico repeats its call for the lifting of the economic, trade and financial blockade imposed upon Cuba.\nIf peace is to last, it must be sustainable. To that end, the new paradigm entails focusing efforts on conflict prevention and using a proactive, strategic and long- term approach. We recognize that one of the greatest threats is the existence of nuclear weapons. Historically, Mexico has been a proponent of disarmament and has emphatically condemned nuclear tests. We will continue to work towards a world free of that global threat.\nI would like to take this opportunity to recognize the positive work of Mr. Ban Ki-moon at the head of the United Nations Secretariat. Mexico appreciates his dedication and commitment. Thanks to his vision and leadership, agreements of great importance for the future of the planet have been reached in recent years. That is no minor feat, especially given the highly volatile and complex international context in which he has had to perform his duties.\nIn recent decades, the world has made great progress, including major improvements in the quality of the lives of millions of people. Even so, it is also true that many societies are clearly dissatisfied with their current conditions. That situation creates a divide between citizens and their authorities, which fuels mistrust in institutions and heightens uncertainty about the future. In Latin America, for example, the the clear deterioration in public support for democracy revealed by the Latinobar\u00f3metro survey is extremely grave. Faced with that challenge, the world cannot fall into the trap of demagoguery or authoritarianism.\nThe only viable path ahead, the only true response to a demanding citizenry, is democracy itself. The response must be more openness, more transparency and better accountability. As Governments, we must be able to listen to and to deal with an increasingly well- informed citizenry that has more means at its disposal for expressing opinions and participating in public affairs. Social networks are enabling greater public participation, turning each individual into a potential agent for change.\nIn that context, Governments must make greater efforts to better communicate with the societies they serve. Governments must communicate to publicize achievements, to recognize and explain missteps, but above all to map out the road ahead together with their societies. It is essential that we promote public debate, contrast ideas and assume shared commitments, using the new communication technologies that are increasingly available and accessible to the entire population. Let us recognize in our pluralism and ongoing dialogue the ideal tools for building in democracy a better future. The response to disillusionment with democracy lies in democracy itself. Our Governments must foster societies that are increasingly inclusive and participatory, where all citizens enjoy the benefits of development.\nGoing forward, we already have a clearly defined road map, based on the Sustainable Development Goals. These are very clear Goals for overcoming poverty and ensuring equal opportunity, gender equity, protection of the environment and justice and peace on which all our countries must concentrate our efforts. Mexico reaffirms its strong commitment to democratic principles as the only path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, at the outset, to convey my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. The Republic of the Congo, as one of the Vice-Presidents who will help to lighten his burden during the session, is fully committed to his success.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay heartfelt tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, who is coming to the end of his term of office as Secretary-General. Thanks to his leadership, he has been able to mobilize world leaders and all actors on the international stage around the great global challenges of our time. He has laid the foundation for the reform of the Organization and created conditions conduciveto its fully undertaking its historic mission in global governance.\nThe Republic of the Congo welcomes the work accomplished by the outgoing President, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose wisdom and foresight facilitated the unanimous adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda heralds the historic advent of a new era of sustainable development.\nI would like to remind the Assembly that the Government of my country expended considerable resources on the implementation of the Millenium Development Goals. We now seek to build our future on these beginnings and continue our commitment by achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the ultimate aim being to guarantee the welfare of the Congolese people.\nHowever, the efforts of our Government today require the support of the international community, specifically through financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund, the Blue Fund, the Adaptation Fund and the Green Economy Fund in Central Africa. I can assure the Assembly that the Government of my country will invest all available resources and spare no effort to ensure that all Congolese people live in dignity and that no one is left behind. Such was the commitment undertaken by my country in adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe Republic of the Congo appreciates the value and significance of the decision at the Group of 20 (G-20) Summit held recently in Hangzhou, China, to support the industrialization of developing countries, in particular in Africa, where this is greatly needed. This timely decision reassures us of the commitment of the G-20 countries with a view to implementing Sustainable Development Goal 17 in its target of revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. We fail to see how Africa can develop sustainably and modernize without first undergoing industrialization. We know that industrialization is contingent upon an energy supply, and it is for that reason that the Republic of the Congo fully supports the electrification plans for the continent that are currently being discussed. We trust that this is not a pious hope.\nFive years ago, we all welcomed the birth of the youngest nation of this world, that is, the Republic of South Sudan. Unfortunately, two years after its independence this country was plunged into seemingly endless fratricidal conflicts, for which its civilians have paid a heavy price. From this rostrum, we encourage all stakeholders in that conflict to demonstrate their political will and perseverance by committing in good faith to the implementation of the peace agreement signed in August 2015 in Addis Ababa. The severity of the situation in South Sudan today requires the rapid deployment of a regional protection force under a Security Council mandate. Such deployment is imperative in all respects, for the time has come to end this intolerable bloodbath that risks compromising the future of this young nation forever. Equally imperative is the need to build a climate of trust among the various protagonists to the conflict in order to ensure that national reconciliation can indeed be achieved.\nJust yesterday the Central African Republic fell prey to a grave crisis. Today, thanks to international solidarity and the commitment of the United Nations, the European Union, France, the United States and members of the Economic Community of Central African States, that country was able to successfully manage a political transition, which concluded with presidential elections, thereby paving the way for a better future with collective hope. The Republic of the Congo welcomes that accomplishment, which is an expression of the will of a people determined to rid themselves of their old demons and to restore peace and stability after several years of chaos. The Republic of the Congo encourages the efforts for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction that President Faustin Archange Touadera and his Government are undertaking with courage and self-sacrifice. My country reiterates here \u2014 just as it did at the ninth meeting of the International Contact Group on the Central African Republic, held recently in Bangui - our support for, and solidarity with, our brother country within the framework of both the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic and the International Support Group.\nWe cannot but deplore the tragic events that have for nearly a week now shaken Kinshasa and plunged the brother people of the Democratic Republic of Congo into mourning. As the Secretary-General did a few days ago, we invite our Congolese brothers to seek peaceful solutions through an inclusive dialogue in a spirit of mutual tolerance.\nThe post-electoral crisis in Gabon has engendered acts of violence that continue to be a source of concern for us all. We very much hope that the brother people of that country will draw on that Bantu wisdom we share with them in order to emerge reconciled from that difficult ordeal.\nI could not conclude my statement without mentioning the recent institutional developments that my own country has undergone following the referendum held on 25 October 2015. The referendum led to the adoption of a new Constitution, better adapted to the requirements of a law-abiding State in its most widely accepted form. We now have a Constitution that strengthens the principle of the separation of powers, enshrines the independence of the judiciary, abolishes the death penalty, affirms the equality of men and women, recognizes the fundamental rights of our indigenous peoples and lays the groundwork for a participatory democracy. We have a Constitution that, alongside our national human rights commission, establishes bodies whose duty it is to maintain social cohesion through justice and equity, but also by bringing peace and tranquillity to hearts and minds. They include a national dialogue council, a women\u2019s advisory council, a youth advisory council, a national council of elders and an advisory council for people with disabilities.\nIn short, all of these many innovations, which seek to respond to the desires of our sovereign people and the many challenges facing us today, will undoubtedly improve political, economic and social governance in our country. All of them are intended to benefit the greater good of our people.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to address the Assembly once again. I would like to start by joining the previous speakers in conveying my Government\u2019s congratulations to Ambassador Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\nLast year, we, the leaders of the international community, came together in the realization that, in an increasingly interdependent world, all of our actions are, more than ever before, closely connected and impact one another. We therefore collectively pledged to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to transform our world for the benefit of humankind. The universal, comprehensive and indivisible 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents a common reference point for all of us and our guiding tool as we attempt to effectively tackle the universal challenges that transcend boundaries and threaten regional and international cohesion.\nChallenges such as poverty, hunger, child mortality, social and economic inequality, lack of adequate health standards and educational opportunities have, in turn, aggravated worrying phenomena such as religious fundamentalism, sectarianism, terrorism, civil war and ethnic conflicts. The combination of all those factors has resulted in the extraordinary humanitarian crisis we are witnessing in the forcible displacement of millions of people, with the consequent unprecedented wave of refugees and migration flows that we are all witnessing, some of us at our doorstep. In that regard, it goes without saying that, in order to reverse such disturbing developments and establish more prosperous, just and peaceful societies, we need to address collectively and in an effective manner the root causes that have led to the uncontrolled exacerbation of those flows, through a two-fold interrelated approach.\nFirst, by directing and concentrating our efforts so as to finally make sustainable development possible in all of the countries and regions in need. That can be achieved only if we adopt a targeted and results-oriented approach towards development cooperation, which will create the political and socioeconomic conditions needed for institution-building, stability and economic growth by, inter alia, eliminating inequality and social exclusion, addressing gender inequality and combating gender-based violence, facilitating investment in human capital via capacity development and education, especially by promoting girls\u2019 education, strengthening the role of key productive sectors, such as agriculture, energy and health, building resilience and fostering full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and enhancing good governance and promoting the rule of law, as well as combating corruption.\nSecondly, we need to resourcefully confront the threats posed by ongoing conflicts, as well as prevent future ones, in order to achieve lasting and viable political solutions that will promote regional peace, security and predictability. To that end, I wish to recall that the current session of the General Assembly was preceded by the High-level Meeting on large movements of refugees and migrants, during which we confirmed our shared responsibility to collectively address the issue of enforced human displacement. In parallel, all of us should direct our efforts, in an inclusive way, to combat human traffickers and the enablers of terrorism. Given that in today\u2019s globalized world, all of us, even if in different contexts and to varying degrees, inevitably face some or all of those challenges, meaningful and effective multilateralism should be reinforced. That is critical. To that end, we should reconsider the prevention and conflict-resolution mechanisms at our disposal, with a view to making them more efficient, effective and immediate.\nThat can be achieved only by strengthening our support for and commitment to the United Nations, which is the only international forum that was established by all of us with the aim of cooperatively resolving regional and international threats to peace and security. Otherwise, we run the risk of an indefinite perpetuation of the current humanitarian crisis and ongoing conflicts, which would serve the best interests of their perpetrators at the expense of our universal principles.\nAs his 10-year tenure is coming to an end, I wish to convey both my Government\u2019s and my personal appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General, for his service in the promotion of our common values, and for his hard work and accomplishments. In particular, I wish to commend him for his instrumental role in getting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted, for his work on the recent agreement on the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework and, of course, for bringing the United Nations Conference on climate change to a successful conclusion through the Paris Agreement. It is an agreement that Cyprus is committed to ratifying by the end of the year. Moreover, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his active role in achieving a peaceful and comprehensive settlement on long- standing international issues, including the Cyprus problem \u2014 a problem that, sadly, is the second-longest- standing unresolved international issue on the United Nations agenda.\nFollowing the tragic events of 1974 and Turkey\u2019s invasion, the continuing military occupation of more than a third of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus and, at the same time, the forced displacement of approximately 40 per cent of the population, the Greek Cypriot side, in a spirit of compromise, accepted the transformation of the unitary State into a federal one. Since then, a plethora of Security Council resolutions have reaffirmed the basis of the settlement as a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as well as the high-level agreements, with a single international legal personality, a single sovereignty and a single citizenship. At the same time, successive leaders of the two communities have engaged unsuccessfully so far in numerous rounds of talks.\nFollowing my election in 2013, a renewed effort at negotiation on 11 February 2014 led to the adoption of the Joint Declaration by the leaders of the two communities and the resumption of the negotiating process. On the one hand, the Joint Declaration encapsulates the following fundamental principles: the reaffirmation of the basis of the settlement; Cyprus\u2019 continued membership in the United Nations and the European Union (EU); the values upon which the EU is founded shall be safeguarded throughout the island, with full respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms; and union, in whole or in part, with any other country or any form of partition or secession or any other unilateral change to the state of affairs shall be prohibited.\nOn the other hand, it established the methodology of the talks. All chapters would be discussed interdependently. The process would be led by the leaders, and only an agreement freely reached by them might be put to simultaneous referenda. Any kind of arbitration would, therefore, be excluded. Nothing would be considered as agreed until everything is agreed. The leaders would aim to reach a settlement as soon as possible, without any enforced or artificial timelines. Thus, both communities have agreed on the overarching rules and modalities that are to guide the negotiating process. That has enabled the two leaders to have a clear and shared understanding on the framework of the envisaged settlement and on the ways and means of achieving it.\nLast year, following the change in the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot community, I spoke of my revived hope that the new round of negotiations would end the unacceptable status quo. This year, following a series of\nfrequent meetings between the two leaders, I have the pleasure of informing the Assembly that progress has been achieved on the important aspects of the Cyprus problem, confirming, inter alia, that United Cyprus will have a single international legal personality, a single sovereignty and a single citizenship, thereby guaranteeing, for all Cypriots, the freedom of movement and the right to acquire property, reside, practise a trade or profession and establish and operate a business or engage in any economic activity throughout Cyprus; full respect for the individual\u2019s right to property; ensuring that the demographic character of the island on the first day of the settlement will reflect, with a slight deviation, the traditional demographic composition of the Republic of Cyprus as established in 1960; ensuring that the said demographic composition will not be altered by outside influences; the implementation of the EU acquis throughout the territory of Cyprus, without deviations or permanent derogations; and protecting the bizonal and bicommunal character of the settlement through specific clauses.\nAs agreed by the two leaders, the federal Constitution shall prescribe that the United Cyprus Federation shall be composed of two constituent States of equal status, establishing the mode in which political equality will be exercised, including the effective participation in decision-making at the federal level. I must admit that further convergence has been reached on most aspects in the chapters on governance, economy and the European Union to the benefit of all Turkish and Greek Cypriots. At the same time, what is also encouraging is that, in contrast to previous negotiations, discussions in the form of brainstorming have, for the first time, commenced in relation to the chapters on territorial readjustments and security.\nI do not wish to overlook the significant progress that has been achieved; however, I feel obliged to stress that differences remain on a number of issues regarding the chapters on governance, the EU and the economy. But the most significant divergences lie in the core and fundamental chapters on property, territory, and security and guarantees, which will significantly impact whether a solution could be feasible in the very near future.\nMy aim is to avoid the failures of the past and to present to the people a clear and well-prepared settlement with no interpretive or other ambiguities and deficiencies, ensuring that the solution will be politically and economically viable, functional and lasting. In that respect, we need to address the financial dimension of the settlement, including costs related to the property issue and the institutional functioning of the Federal State; the safeguarding of the smooth implementation of the agreement; the first day of the solution and what it would entail; the introduction of the euro as legal tender on day one of the settlement; and, one of the most important issues, the speedy implementation of the various aspects of the agreement, among others.\nI wish to reiterate yet again my resolve to continue working with the same determination and intensive pace, in order to reach a solution as soon as possible, hopefully, by the end of the year. I believe that this ambitious goal is achievable, provided that all interested parties and stakeholders show a similar degree of commitment, engage constructively and proceed with concrete and tangible steps that positively reinforce the negotiating process.\nWe need a solution that will reunite our country, its people, the economy and our institutions; create a win-win situation for all Cypriots \u2014 we do not want to create winners or leave behind losers; address the expectations, sensitivities and concerns of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots; ensure the building of a modern EU and United Nations Member State, enjoying full sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity; restore and fully respect the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens; establish Cyprus as an international paradigm of peaceful coexistence and prosperous collaboration between all of its citizens, irrespective of their different ethnic, cultural and religious diversity; and rid Cyprus of third-country military troops and guarantees, an anachronism in today\u2019s world.\nIt is my firm belief that the solution of the problem in Cyprus would, first and foremost, be to the benefit of all Cypriots, by creating conditions of peace, prosperity and a flourishing society, and unlocking the country\u2019s full potential for future generations. Regionally, it would turn Cyprus into a model country of stability and predictability, and would broaden the role of Cyprus as a security-provider in one of the most turbulent areas of the world. At the European level, it would end the oxymoron of one of its Member States being divided, while it would also positively reinforce relations between the European Union and Turkey, as well as strengthen the rest of the security architecture of the EU. Last but not least, solving an international problem that has been on the agenda of the United Nations for the past several decades will offer a beacon of hope, showing that even the most intractable problems can be solved peacefully through the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Thomson on his election as President of General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I commend the exemplary manner of his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, who presided over the Assembly last year.\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon marks the completion of his tenure this year. I recall our many meetings and conversations on a host of important issues. Always a true and trusted friend, he recognized Bangladesh\u2019s development gains as a model for the rest of the world. I wish him and Mrs. Ban continued success and good health.\nBangladesh\u2019s Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, standing before the General Assembly in 1974, stated:\n\u201cOur total commitment to peace is born of the realization that only an environment of peace would enable us to ... mobilize and concentrate all our energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and unemployment.\u201d (A/PV.2243, para. 12)\nOur world is now at a juncture where the end of those scourges is in sight. There are many creative and practical solutions in our hands. The amazing power of technology, ideas and global citizens help us to imagine a brave new world. Yet our world is not free from tension and fear. Violent conflicts continue to rage in several places, with a heavy toll on human lives. Those fleeing from the conflicts are often denied protection across borders. Dire humanitarian needs are at times ignored and access to those in need is blocked. What was the crime of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned at sea? What was the fault of 5-year- old Omran Daqneesh, who was seriously wounded in his hometown of Aleppo by an air strike? As a mother, it is indeed hard to understand those cruelties. Will our global conscience not be stirred by such events?\nWe have just concluded the historic summit for refugees and migrants. The outcome of the summit should help redefine perceptions and realities of human mobility in our time. Migrants and refugees must be seen as potential agents for change both in their places of origin and destination. Bangladesh offers to co-facilitate the work of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. We look forward to a constructive dialogue on all related issues at the Global Forum on Migration and Development, which we will host in December.\nIn 2015, we adopted a transformative development agenda with a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The political will behind the agenda needs to be translated into concrete and meaningful support for countries that are lagging behind. In order to catch up, the developing world needs access to transformative technologies. The internationally agreed development commitments for the least developed countries (LDCs) must be fulfilled in order to pave the way for their graduation. The Technology Bank for the LDCs should be geared to promoting innovation and predictable resource flows.\nIn Bangladesh, we have already mainstreamed most of the SDGs into our national development plans. A platform under the supervision of the Prime Minister has been created to coordinate and monitor the work. Consultations are now ongoing with local government, civil society, media and academia. They are being carried out in tandem with our Vision 2021 and Vision 2041 policies, which seek to realize Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman\u2019s dream of building a \u201cSonar\u201d, or Golden Bangladesh, that is free from hunger, poverty, illiteracy and exploitation.\nOur aim is to build an inclusive, empowered, digital and knowledge-based society. My Government is focusing on innovative public service delivery, mass access to information, and enhanced transparency and accountability. We have set up about 10,000 digital centres across the country in order to deliver 200 different services to people\u2019s doorsteps. Health services through mobile phones and a 24-hour web portal are complementing the work of 16,438 community and local health clinics. Digital laboratories and multimedia classrooms are operating in a growing number of educational institutions.\nThe growing web of physical and virtual connectivity is creating new opportunities for our people. As a key enabler of economic development, broadband connectivity should be available to every citizen of the world. I invite world leaders and other international partners to join hands in making this possible. Our Government is committed to providing a voice and data connection to every citizen by 2021.\nBangladesh\u2019s strategic location makes it an emerging hub for regional connectivity, foreign investment and global outsourcing. We have embarked on large-scale infrastructure projects to match our development aspirations. Multimodal transport networks are being built to promote trade and people-to-people contacts among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal.\nThe work of the 6.15 kilometre-long Padma Multipurpose Bridge was commissioned with our own resources. Discussions are under way to build a deep seaport, while our third seaport in Paira has commenced operations. Work on the metro rail in our capital, Dhaka, is also under way. One hundred economic zones are being developed across the country to allow potential investors to invest in Bangladesh.\nSuch forward-looking thrusts in our progress are supported by the impressive performance of our macroeconomic and socioeconomic indicators. In the fiscal period 2015-2016, our economy posted a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of over 7 per cent. Bangladesh has experienced one of the fastest poverty reduction rates in countries with a modest resource base. We have brought poverty down from 56.7 per cent in 1991 to 22.4 per cent today. We have already gone from the low to the medium category in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Report and have reached the World Bank\u2019s lower- middle income status. Over the past seven years, despite the global recession, our export earnings more than tripled to reach $34.24 billion, remittance flows have increased nearly threefold, and our foreign currency reserves have multiplied 8.5 times, from $3.5 billion to over $31 billion. During the same period, power- generation capacity almost tripled, as did foreign direct investment. A key to our development strategy is our focus on addressing inequality through social security, decent work and financial inclusion. We allocate over 13 per cent of our budget to social-safety-net spending, which is 2.3 per cent of our GDP.\nClimate change threatens many of our development gains. The landmark Paris Climate Agreement recognizes the importance of adaptation, loss, damage and climate justice. Bangladesh has ratified the Agreement, and we hope that the large carbon-emitting countries will ratify it soon.\nWe must join ranks to preserve our natural resources for succeeding generations. Bangladesh reaffirms the need for the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources so as to tap the potential of a blue economy.\nThe life-sustaining force of water is a finite resource. We have a shared responsibility to ensure the judicious and equitable use of our common waters. We must stand by our pledge to provide clean drinking water and sanitation for all. I shall continue to champion these issues as a member of the High-level Panel on Water.\nI firmly believe that without women\u2019s participation, sustainable development will simply not be tenable. A host of measures, including the promotion of girls\u2019 education, undertaken half a decade ago have started to yield dividends. Women in Bangladesh are now increasingly becoming an integral part of our development endeavours. Around 3.5 million women are now working in the garment industry, a leading export earning sector. The percentage of women in all professions is rapidly rising. Bangladesh is perhaps the only country in the world today where women hold the posts of Prime Minister and Leader of the House, Leader of the Opposition, Speaker and Deputy Leader of the House. Presently, we have 70 women members of Parliament, constituting 20 per cent of the House. More than 12,500 elected women representatives are serving in local government bodies.\nLast year, I mentioned terrorism and violent extremism as one of the two major global challenges of our time (see A/70/PV.19). We see these menaces sweeping across borders. No country seems immune, no individual beyond their reach. Terrorists are now often killing many innocent people everywhere, from the United States of America to Europe, and from Africa to Asia.\nWe believe that terrorists have no religion, caste or creed. We must unite in our resolve to defeat and degrade them in all their forms and manifestations. We have to identify the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism. At the same time, we have to identify the mentors, masterminds, abettors, financiers, arms suppliers and trainers of these terrorists and extremists, and we must take strong action against them.\nAs a victim of terrorist attacks myself, I have a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism and violent extremism. Our Government has succeeded in dismantling homegrown terrorist groups, plugging their regular financing pipelines and flushing out their regional operatives from our territory. With the vicious rise of certain international terrorist entities, it appears that some local fringe elements have drawn inspiration and managed to regroup and rebrand themselves.\nBangladesh, a unique country of religious harmony, experienced a grisly attack on 1 July 2016, when homegrown terrorists killed 20 people at a Dhaka restaurant. We were able to rescue 13 hostages unharmed, but that horrific incident left a deep scar on the hearts of the people of Bangladesh.\nWe are now battling this new wave of terrorism. We have undertaken massive programmes to awaken people and warn them against radicalization and to stand against militancy and extremism. The whole-of- society response I called for has been unprecedented. I am confident that with our people\u2019s resilience and support, we will ensure that terrorists have absolutely no place on our soil.\nI would also like to urge the world community to work globally to dry up the sources of funds, arms and ammunition as well as moral and material support for militants and terrorists.\nBangladesh will carry on promoting the culture of peace that is at the heart of the agenda of the United Nations. We shall uphold our contribution to peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Our decision to set up a peacebuilding centre in Dhaka will allow us to share our experience with other countries that are emerging from conflict.\nLikewise, we will remain vocal about recognizing the role of national judicial processes in ensuring accountability and justice for mass atrocities. We have moved past decades of impunity to ensure the trial of the local perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity during our liberation war, in 1971.\nThe recent efforts to relaunch the Middle East peace process and end the hostilities against the brotherly Palestinian people must be pursued, in the right direction.\nIn our globalized world, there are challenges. But there are also potential opportunities and benefits for all, but only if we know how to manage the process properly. We are all gathered here to serve our one humanity. Let us work through our differences and find common ground to make the pragmatic changes we wish to see in the world around us. The United Nations provides us with a unique platform to do so. Let us renew our resolve to create an Organization of enduring relevance.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, may I warmly congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. He may rest assured of the full support of my delegation in working towards the complete success of this session of the Assembly.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark on the outstanding way in which he presided over the previous session. May I also pay warm tribute to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, not only for what he has done since the previous session, but also for all the laudable work he has so untiringly carried out to achieve the noble objectives of the United Nations since he was elected 10 years ago. I particularly commend and am grateful for his personal involvement and focus on my country, the Central African Republic, during the hard times that it has passed through.\nIt is a great honour for me to address the Assembly to describe the evolution of the situation in the Central African Republic and to share with it my country\u2019s vision regarding the major issues facing our Organization.\nI stand before the Assembly today to bear witness to the entire international community of the recognition by the Central African people of the invaluable support to my country, the Central African Republic, which has now returned to stability and constitutional legality. From this rostrum, on behalf of the Central African people, I wish to pay tribute to all actions carried out by the United Nations system, particularly in connection with the deployment of the international forces who are at this very time working to bring security and peacebuilding in my country.\nI wish to express once again the gratitude of the people of the Central African Republic to the international community in its entirety for its solidarity and constant support during our efforts to return to constitutional legality, thereby putting an end to the political transition that was established after the coup of 24 March 2013.\nMay I also acknowledge the spirit of the people of the Central African Republic, who, in such large and determined numbers, voted in an exemplary election, thus demonstrating their espousal of democracy and constitutional order. I also pay a warm tribute to the entire political class in the Central African Republic for the maturity it displayed to the entire world in respecting the voice of the people in the elections.\nAs President, in whom is vested the trust of the entire Central African people, I have taken stock of the immense challenges we face and the expectations of my fellow citizens, who understandably yearn for peace, national reconciliation and socioeconomic development.\nThe Central African Republic has turned the page on its dark history. Central Africans are more than ever determined to finally break the cycle of violence so as to be able to aspire legitimately to peace, security, justice, freedom and sustainable development. Since my accession to the presidency of the country, steps have been taken to ensure that the Government and all State institutions share the common goal of rebuilding the country through the necessary reforms.\nNo State can claim to be able to develop while its economic, social or indeed its political fabric remains plagued by the evils of corruption, injustice and impunity. I can assure the Assembly that the fight against corruption is at the heart of our concerns. Therefore, the Government that I have the heavy responsibility of leading will spare no effort to establish a mechanism for the relentless fight against corruption and financial crime.\nThe Central African Republic has certainly begun to revive the democratic process, but the situation still remains fragile. Much remains to be done. That is why as soon as I was inaugurated as President of the Republic, I expressed my ambition to bring together all Central Africans around a State reconstruction project, so that we in the Central African Republic would become the masters of our own destiny and of the development of our country.\nI am committed to leading the work for a political, economic, social and cultural transformation that will enable us to dispel the evils of insecurity, the dysfunction of political institutions, corruption, the deterioration of living conditions and the loss of moral standards, all of which have undermined our society. The priorities of my Government are therefore based on four main pillars: peace and security, national reconciliation and administrative reform, economic recovery, and justice and human rights.\nWith regard to peace and security, the imperative for the Government consists in the rapid application of the disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and repatriation programmes so that all Central African men and women of all walks of life can live in peace and security with one another throughout the land.\nSimilarly, security-sector reform remains a major concern of the Government. A delegation of the Central African Republic outlined the strategies and programmes for such reforms in the Central African Republic at United Nations Headquarters in June. A decision was taken to support my country\u2019s endeavours in the recognition of the efforts at dialogue with armed groups that I have undertaken since my assumption of responsibility. That is why I am taking this opportunity to urge a major mobilization of our partners at the next Brussels Conference for the Central African Republic, scheduled for 17 November, with regard to their contribution to finance the security-sector reform component.\nOn the issue of the restoration of State authority and the process of redeploying the Administration, the Government has undertaken, with the assistance of the international community, including the United Nations, actions to ensure the presence of public authority throughout the territory and tot ensureg peace and security. The defence and security forces must therefore continue to bolster our border control against the threats of cross-border crime, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, money-laundering, trafficking in drugs and narcotics, and terrorism, particularly by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, and human trafficking.\nThe Government has undertaken emergency measures aimed at rebuilding the Central African armed forces, which will help to enable the establishment of an inclusive republican army. To achieve that, the Central African Republic, through me, calls for the total lifting of the arms embargo imposed on it. It must be remembered that the ban, even if necessary at the time, is no longer justified today in this new era of national reconstruction.\nJustice and human rights involve the rehabilitation of the institutions of the judiciary so as to guarantee the rights of citizens and strengthen the fight against impunity. In that regard, it is appropriate to strengthen the Special Criminal Court for the Central African Republic so as to bring the perpetrators of crimes to justice before the competent courts and to deal with the issue of reparations for the harm suffered.\nConcerning economic recovery, the Government has implemented reforms aimed at improving the business climate in order to attract private investment and has committed itself to reestablishing State infrastructure to support growth. The cyclical, repetitive crises in the Central African Republic have led to the precarious living conditions of our people and to widespread impoverishment. I welcome the fact that the international community has understood what is at stake here.\nMy Government, for its part, is firmly committed to peacebuilding, national reconciliation, the re-establishment of the defence and security forces and an economic recovery plan. Those are our goals; those are our priorities. I have every confidence that, together, Central Africans will pursue those goals with all their strength and all their energy.\nThe Central African Republic is once again among Member States. The Central African Republic has taken its place as a free and democratic State among the community of nations. It is ready to contribute to building a world of peace, tolerance, freedom, justice and democracy. Despite our determination to take charge of our destiny, the Central African Republic is still fragile, absolutely in need of the support of all our partners, both bilateral and multilateral. On behalf of my country, I again call for the support of fellow Member States.\nThe United Nations remains the indispensable forum par excellence for addressing global issues and researching appropriate solutions. As a Member, the Central African Republic can assure the Assembly of our abiding commitment to the ideals of the Organization, founded on the values of equality, peace, security, justice and development, to which all peoples throughout the world aspire.\nI welcome the relevance of the theme of the seventy-first session of the General Assembly: \u201cSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, chosen a year after the adoption of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The choice of that theme is justified by the desire to see those Goals realized by 2030. For the time has come to reverse the trend of extreme poverty, which continues, unfortunately, in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The time has come to reduce inequalities between rich and poor and to create an environment that provides a good place to live for the well-being of everyone.\nIt is recognized that the majority of the least developed countries and post-conflict countries, including the Central African Republic, did not attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There are several reasons for that, chief among them political instability. In fact, in 2011 the Government developed a framework for accelerating the effort to achieve the MDGs dealing with hunger and food security, but the crisis of 2012 ended those actions, leaving them incomplete.\nThe Central African Republic has officially launched the implementation process for the Sustainable Development Goals, involving all national stakeholders \u2014 the public administration, civil society, the private sector, international partners, development partners and international non-governmental organizations. That clearly indicates the willingness of the Government resolutely to lead the process of achieving the SDGs and avoid the uneven results that characterized the process of the attainment of the MDGs, for the reasons I cited earlier.\nThe Government learned lessons from the experience and has undertaken to implement the SDGs on new bases involving partnership and the participation of all strata of our society. Thus the Government has undertaken, within the framework of its national reconstruction policy, the preparation of a recovery and peacebuilding programme in the Central African Republic that includes humanitarian assistance, early recovery and development. There are three main planks: peace, reconciliation and security; the renewal of the social contract between the State and the people; and economic recovery and the revitalization of the productive sectors.\nTo achieve this, the Government intends to develop a partnership with national and international non-governmental organizations, the private sector, development partners and community-based organizations so as to create the synergies necessary to emerge from the crisis. To that end, the planned study on the vision of the Central African Republic through 2040 will be carried out within the framework of the 2063 Agenda for Africa and will include concrete objectives.\nWith the support of technical and financial partners, we will set up an appropriate institutional framework for the follow-up and monitoring of the work to achieve the SDGs. Under its auspices we will define our priorities in the context of the recovery and peacebuilding programme, the recommendations of the Common African Position and the conclusions of the consultative regional meeting on the SDGs, held in October 2013.\nThe issue of migrants and refugees, which affects the entire world, has in recent years worsened and is now a major concern of the international community. It is a very pressing problem that requires the attention of every country, regardless of their involvement in the management of migratory flows.\nThe high-level meeting that was just held was an opportunity to highlight the pressing global challenges caused by these mass movements of peoples, in order to devise well-thought-out solutions within a framework of international responsibility-sharing. I welcome the commitment of Member States to seek a more humane solution to the issue. At the Valletta Summit on Migration and the first Global Humanitarian Summit, held in Istanbul, world leaders shared their views on the root causes of migration and displaced persons.\nIn the Central African Republic, sustainable solutions to ensure the return of our compatriots who have been displaced within our country to their areas of origin, as well as to the issue of refugees, are being studied in order to create a national platform for disaster risk management and the prevention and management of poor socioeconomic conditions such as low wages, unemployment, underemployment in rural areas, poverty and lack of resources, which are very often the cause of these movements.\nOn climate change and sustainable development, it is urgent that the world adopt sound policies that can generate growth and take into account the problem of climate change. Such growth must be able to reduce poverty. Protection of the environment, effective management of resources, and economic growth integrated into green growth provide a valuable opportunity for African countries. It is not fair that Africa should pay a higher price when it is but a victim. That is why I urge the international community to focus in particular on the adoption of an appropriate mechanism to support Africa. The commitments made at the Paris climate summit must be respected so as to bring about true sustainable development.\nBefore I conclude, let me say that we trust that Member States all will decide to provide our Organization with the means to attain the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The Central African Republic will continue to make its modest contribution to our Organization and in our common quest for peace, security and development for all.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate His Excellency Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also wish to express my delegation\u2019s deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, for his leadership and able stewardship.\nMalaysia is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For Malaysia, the nation\u2019s development agenda has always been people-centred, which runs parallel to the aspirations of the SDGs. I am pleased to state here that Malaysia has set in motion initiatives and actions to achieve the 2030 Agenda. Our current five-year development plan \u2014 the eleventh Malaysia plan, covering the period from 2016 to 2020 \u2014 was formulated with people at the centre of all development efforts and with the theme \u201cAnchoring growth on people\u201d.\nThe plan embraces three main principles: achieving high income, inclusiveness and sustainability. In many of its aspects, the plan mirrors the multidimensional nature of the 2030 Agenda. As the 2030 Agenda is implemented, the SDGs will be integrated into the national framework of the plan. Malaysia is also in the process of formulating a national SDG road map, establishing a broad-based and inclusive committee to oversee the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs and strengthening the data requirements for them. That road map will serve as an overarching and guiding policy for Malaysia\u2019s sustainable development.\nIn the meantime, every effort is being made to ensure that the initiatives outlined in the eleventh Malaysia plan are duly implemented. They include a technical and vocational education training (TVET) component. By providing essential skills through TVET programmes, we are not only preparing the youth for the labour market, but also preparing human capital for nation-building. Graduates of our TVET programmes, which involve cooperation between the National Youth Skills Institute and various multinational companies, have a 90 per cent employability rate.\nNext, I want to talk about our very own magic, or Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre (MaGIC), which will work to make Malaysia the startup capital of Asia. Our mission is to catalyse the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Malaysia by bringing together the abundant resources of partners and communities alike in order to develop entrepreneurs that will start enduring and high-growth companies, thereby exerting a positive impact at the regional and global levels. MaGIC, which is located in Cyberjaya, Malaysia, was jointly launched by the President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, and our Prime Minister, Mr. Najib Tun Razak, in April 2014. On that memorable day, MaGIC signed a memorandum of understanding with UP Global to further foster and develop a vibrant ecosystem for startup companies in Malaysia and beyond.\nIn Malaysia, we no longer work in silos. We have moved into a new working environment that we call the \u201cblue ocean\u201d and have bid farewell to the archaic \u201cred ocean\u201d. We have introduced a unique national development strategy based on creativity and innovation known as the National Blue Ocean Strategy (NBOS). It is a strategy in which over 80 ministries and agencies \u2014 from the police and military, to women, youth and higher education organizations \u2014 are collaborating to formulate and execute creative NBOS initiatives that are transforming the country. The unique Strategy also involves public and private partnership. NBOS gave birth to our unique urban transformation centres and rural transformation centres. One only needs to go to either centre for all Government services.\nMalaysia is also no stranger in the area of volunteerism. I am referring to our very own organization of Malaysian-based Hospitals Beyond Boundaries (HBB), as well as to other voluntary organizations and non-governmental organizations. HBB is a non-profit organization that is committed to providing accessible health care through community- run clinics in underprivileged communities in Cambodia and Malaysia. HBB is led by a recipient of the United Nations Young Leader Award, Dr. Mohd Lutfi Fadil Lokman, who was selected under SDG 3, \u201cEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\u201d.\nWe have heard testimonies from various small island developing States on the devastating impact of climate change on their countries and populations and the existential threat it presents to their subsistence. We have seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters, such as floods, coastal erosion and landslides, in many other countries across the globe.\nSuch extreme weather events have affected economic activities and the livelihoods and safety of people. If left unchecked, I am afraid climate change could, in fact, constitute the greatest threat multiplier for global security. Realizing the increasingly urgent need to address the impact of climate change, we came together in Paris last December and took the historic step of adopting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We must now follow through and carry out the commitments assumed thereunder. Malaysia is committed to reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions of its gross domestic product by up to 45 percent by 2030. Malaysia is currently working towards its ratification of the Paris Agreement.\nAn international environment that enables peace and security is also important for the successful implementation of the SDGs. Yet we are witnessing various conflicts in several parts of the world. The rise in the phenomenon of non-State actors such as Da\u2019esh, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab has caused the instability and insecurity of nations. The international community continues to witness horrific acts of cruelty by these non-State actors. They employ terror tactics and extremism as ways of spreading their influence and reach.\nThe fight against terrorism cannot be won through force or punitive measures alone. Malaysia has established deradicalization and rehabilitation programmes that are oriented towards changing the mindsets of radicalized extremist individuals. The programmes are complemented by various forms of humanitarian assistance to facilitate the reintegration of those individuals into society. Such measures are important to avoid relapse. The success rate of our deradicalization programme thus far is around 97.5 per cent. Malaysia has come up with a deradicalization module and a standard operation procedure, which we stand ready to share with other nations.\nNo nation is immune to the threat of international terrorism. Hence, there is an urgent need to address terrorism comprehensively. We need to counter it from an ideological perspective by addressing the narratives and root causes of terrorism and exploring how they could be used to attract people into supporting terrorist groups. We need to explore new solutions and continuously work to enhance our domestic legal framework in the fight against violent extremism. The continuous efforts should involve a diverse cross section of our population. We should enhance our interactions by winning the hearts and minds of religious leaders, women and our youth. We should build networks at all levels of society where they can help by providing counter-narratives and counter-messaging through community-based efforts \u2014 the arts, media, sports, and culture.\nToday, we are still grappling with the problem of determining and identifying the root causes of terrorism. Many people speculate that those root causes could be poverty, deprivation, alienation, suppression or any of myriad other factors. Malaysia therefore joins others in calling for robust and effective international action in our collective fight against terrorism. Such action must be based on full respect for the Charter of the United Nations and for universally recognized principles of law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Only if and when the international community stands united can the terrorists be defeated.\nSeven decades after the inception of the United Nations, the question of Palestine remains unresolved. The protracted crisis highlights the inherent flaws in the workings of the United Nations, where the use of the veto continues to perpetuate the longest occupation in modern history. Over the years, the situation on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory is slowly but surely moving away from a two-State solution. The blockade on Gaza by the occupying Power, the unrelenting expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, the continued construction of illegal walls, the forced transfer of Palestinians from their homes and the gross violations of their human rights continue unabated despite mounting international pressure and criticism.\nI would like to take this opportunity to highlight the lingering problem pertaining to the resettlement of existing refugee populations in host countries to third countries. Lengthy delays in the resettlement of refugees inevitably result in economic, social, political and security hardships for the host country. We therefore urge the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration and the States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its related Protocol to address this matter and act promptly on it. While we are cognizant of the elements contained in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), we emphasize that no initiative should place a State that is not a signatory to the relevant international instruments in a position that is inconsistent with the provisions of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nMalaysia\u2019s robust, rapid development and economic growth have attracted people throughout our region, by both legal and illegal means, who seek better living conditions and greater employment opportunities. These are the main drivers of migration within the South-East Asia region. Malaysia recognizes the contributions of the foreign workers to its economic prosperity and considers it equally important to protect their safety and welfare. Accordingly, the Government of Malaysia pays attention to cases involving labour exploitation, including forced labour, and the definition of trafficking in persons under the Malaysian Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 has been broadened to include labour exploitation. This is in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which requires immediate and stern measures to eradicate forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking. Malaysia works in concert with the international community to tackle and eliminate those heinous crimes, which have caused grave injustice as well as untold suffering.\nMalaysia joins the other Member States in expressing its profound gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his able leadership as Secretary- General of the world body since 2007. It is our fervent hope that the incoming Secretary-General will have strong leadership traits, a transformative vision of the United Nations, in particular the reform of the Security Council, and the ability to address the present and emerging challenges that threaten international peace, security, development and human rights.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate the President on his election, and I commend his predecessor for his effective leadership at the previous session.\nLet me also, on behalf of the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, applaud His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and commitment to the advancement of global peace and development during his 10 years of service to our Organization as Secretary- General. I commend him for his vision and initiatives, including the major high-level panel reviews, the historic adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change and convening the first World Humanitarian Summit. We in Sierra Leone will always remember the Secretary-General with deep appreciation for his exemplary role in mobilizing support for the successful fight against the deadly Ebola disease.\nThe theme chosen by the President for our debate this year, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, could not have been more thoughtful. In order to achieve that goal, we must universally promote the Sustainable Development Goals. We must push forward with energy, compassion and resolve to save the millions of women and children still trapped in poverty, bring peace to our troubled region, and prevent and contain disease outbreaks.\nIn Sierra Leone, drawing on the lessons learned from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, we have taken action to quickly integrate the SDGs into our national development planning processes by linking each of the 17 Goals and 169 targets to our national development programme \u2014 the Agenda for Prosperity. Sierra Leone was one of the 22 countries reviewed during the Economic and Social Council\u2019s High-Level Political Forum in July. We shared our views on how we want to implement the SDGs, on the challenges we foresee and on how we hope to overcome them. At the same time, we have formulated a national integrated results framework that aligns the SDGs with our Alliance for Prosperity monitoring and evaluation mechanism. We have also established an international benchmarks system for Sierra Leone, which will enable us to address the challenges involved in obtaining the reliable statistical data we need in order to report on our progress.\nBut whatever we do at the national level, whatever efforts we make on the global stage, whatever projects the brightest among us design, we will not be able to deliver on the SDGs\u2019 promise of an inclusive, fairer and better world without the reform of the United Nations. Let me be blunt. Our premier global institution lacks the democratic characteristics needed to tackle the development, security and other challenges facing Africa and many other parts of the world. Without strong African voices at the highest level of our premier global decision-making body, without the energetic voices of the region that is home to the world\u2019s largest number of young people, and without the decisive contribution of the continent that is most affected by Security Council decisions, no solution that the United Nations might propose to our challenges can be sustainable, inclusive or lasting.\nYes, Africa\u2019s position is about righting historical wrongs and enhancing its voice in the United Nations. But most of all, Africa\u2019s position relates to our contribution to making the United Nations more effective, democratic and forward-looking. That is why we believe that the dilution of any of its key elements is akin to continuing a status quo that is unfair, unjust, non-inclusive and unfit for the requirements of the twenty-first century. Africa has asked me, as Coordinator of its African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State on United Nations Reforms, to tell the world that we will stand united behind the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. At the African Union\u2019s July summit in Kigali we reaffirmed the African position, and we deplore any attempts to weaken any of those positions through divide-and-rule policies that are reminiscent of the colonial era.\nIn September last year at the Leaders\u2019 Summit on Peacekeeping, we committed to enlarging and modernizing United Nations peacekeeping operations. I made a pledge at the Summit to contribute further to United Nations peacekeeping with commitments to provide two formed police units, special weapons and tactics units and police guards to the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, and we are now ready to deploy at short notice.\nSierra Leone welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s report prepared for the World Humanitarian Summit (A/70/709) and its annex, the Agenda for Humanity. This year\u2019s World Humanitarian Summit was a turning point at which we collectively pledged to improve our response to people caught in natural disasters and conflicts, empower them as agents of their own recovery and summon greater political will for preventing and ending the wars that have caused so much suffering. Millions of people need humanitarian help, and millions more have been forcibly displaced from their homes. We must set the right tone in addressing the lingering challenges facing our world. My delegation endorses the Assembly\u2019s adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) and fully subscribes to its call to address the root causes of the problem, including efforts aimed at preventing crisis situations before they erupt.\nSierra Leone also welcomes the simultaneous adoptions in April by the Security Council of its resolution 2282 (2016) on post-conflict peacebuilding, and by the General Assembly of its resolution 70/262, reviewing the United Nations peacebuilding architecture. The parallel resolutions demonstrate our commitment to take a comprehensive approach to transitional justice and to accountability in the security sector, both of which are critical to consolidating peace, reducing poverty and preventing countries from relapsing into conflict.\nIn Sierra Leone, our commitment to continue to address the key underlying causes of fragility and the drivers of conflict is underlined by our participation as a pilot country in the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States. As the current Chair of the Group of Seven Fragile States Plus, Sierra Leone emphasizes the importance of incorporating SDG 16 into our efforts. We also recognize that the effective management of our natural resources is central to ensuring sustainable socioeconomic development and a resilient future for Sierra Leoneans.\nMy Government remains committed to good governance and will continue to build on our post- conflict peacebuilding and democratic gains by further strengthening our democratic institutions and by providing access to the justice sector and establishing a level playing field there. To that end, we have taken steps to improve the conditions of service in our justice sector in order to attract and deploy more qualified personnel to the bench and as state counsels in every region and district of Sierra Leone. We have established a legal-aid board so as to ensure that every indigent person has legal representation, that no one enters our correctional institutions without an indictment, and that court cases are speedily heard and justice is fairly served. Those strides represent important contributions to our journey towards attaining a resilient and inclusive Sierra Leone. They remain the bedrock of our aspirations to become a middle-income country by 2035.\nThat is why we have hastened to put in place major relevant policy decisions and enacted appropriate legislation to empower women, improve the situation of youth and ensure that the physically challenged are not marginalized. My Government\u2019s vision for the empowerment of women as enshrined in pillar 8 of our Agenda for Prosperity is consistent with global aspirations, in recognition of the crucial importance of women and gender parity in our development process. Most of my Government\u2019s programmes are youth- oriented and range from education to health, community development and employment.\nEfforts to address youth empowerment and unemployment remain at the heart of our Agenda for Prosperity. My Government has also made a record number of appointments of youths and women into top- level decision-making positions, including ministerial, ambassadorial and leadership posts in Government departments and agencies and in the military, police, Parliament, the judiciary and local government.\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa shone a spotlight on the critical need for the world to have a more robust and effective global health architecture, with strong and accountable leadership to deal with health crises, including pandemics. In this context, my delegation commends the High-Level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises for its comprehensive report. We strongly consider its 27 recommendations as the way forward for appropriate action at the national, regional and international levels. We must collectively commit ourselves to the full implementation of the Panel\u2019s recommendations in order to protect humankind from the scourge of future health crises.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, let me express our appreciation to the international community for supporting us in our efforts to defeat the Ebola virus. We are now implementing our post-Ebola recovery programme. We applaud the support that we have received, but we still face enormous resource gaps. I would therefore like to remind our bilateral friends and the international community to fulfil their pledges to our recovery programme.\nThough we contribute almost nothing to global warming, Sierra Leone is the third most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change. Dealing with climate change is therefore an urgent life-and- death matter for us. That is why we welcome the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and we will implement its provisions in Sierra Leone. My Government, in collaboration with our development partners, is implementing projects on adaptation, including climate information and early-warning systems. We remain committed to these efforts, and we seek further collaboration in confronting this global threat against humankind.\nAs we move into the implementation of the first phase of the SDGs, we must remember that fragile States were unable to make remarkable progress in the implementation of the MDGs largely owing to the absence of peace, justice and effective State institutions. It is therefore urgent for all parties to cooperate with global initiatives in finding enduring peace in Syria, South Sudan and Libya. This is why the world must accelerate its efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in fighting terrorism and in stemming the dangerous escalation in the arms race.\nWe cannot sustain this world with bombs and the unending threat of war. We cannot achieve a universal push towards development when armed conflicts continue to drive millions into refugee camps and when millions find themselves trapped between warring factions. We cannot champion the cause of justice and legitimacy when Africa remains excluded from and underrepresented in the highest decision-making organ of our global Organization. The reforms must start here, and they must be deliberate and enduring.\nWhile we acknowledge the gradual progress made so far, particularly in the transparent process of selecting and appointing the next Secretary-General, let me again reiterate that African Member States are unhappy about the slow pace of Security Council reform.\nIn concluding, let me once again reiterate Africa\u2019s strong concern over the continuous failure of the United Nations to adopt measures, including text-based negotiations, that will lead to a comprehensive and early reform of the Security Council to reflect contemporary realities. I would therefore urge that the reform process move faster so that Africa can take its rightful place in the Security Council. The United Nations must change with the times and must do so by effecting the relevant reforms.\nRedressing the much-acknowledged historical injustice done to the continent will be a remarkable step in our universal push to transform our world. We cannot effectively deal with the evolving challenges of our time if we continue to hold on to the edicts and structures established 71 years ago. Equitable geographical representation, with the attendant privileges in the membership of the Security Council, will only make it more legitimate, representative, effective, transparent and accountable.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and to thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the Assembly during the seventieth session, for his fruitful leadership of the Assembly\u2019s work.\nKyrgyzstan supports the theme of our debate, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, which seems very timely to us in the wake of the Assembly\u2019s adoption last year of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nOn 31 August, Kyrgyzstan marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence. Over the years we have been progressing along the difficult path of building a democratic, lawful and economically developed State. Only six years have passed since the people\u2019s revolution of April 2010, which paved the way for Kyrgyzstan\u2019s rebirth. We are proud of what our country has achieved since then. We have taken our own particular and very difficult road to freedom and democracy, and we have paid a high price for it. The freedom-loving people of Kyrgyzstan have learned hard lessons from the mistakes of their first 20 years of independence. Today, they have emerged from that onto the road to stability and shown the world the experience that they have gained in overcoming acute social and political crises and building a free society.\nKyrgyzstan has suffered, but has made a conscious choice to build a parliamentary democracy. In October 2015, for the first time in the country\u2019s history, we held national parliamentary elections using biometric technology. The election results were accepted by all political parties, a testimony to the unity of our people, and have been unanimously recognized as democratic by the international community. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General and all friendly countries for their support for our election preparations. In 2017 we will hold presidential elections, and we urge the United Nations and our partner countries to continue supporting Kyrgyzstan\u2019s efforts to conduct the elections to choose our next leader in accordance with international standards.\nKyrgyzstan fully supports the adoption of a comprehensive agenda for international development in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We welcome the fact that the Sustainable Development Goals take into account the lessons of the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the needs of mountainous and landlocked developing countries such as ours. For Kyrgyzstan, the biggest priority areas in the Sustainable Development Goals include poverty reduction, food security, quality education and health care, economic growth, energy and the preservation of the environment.\nAs we know, one of the three pillars of the 2030 Agenda consists of environmental issues. In Paris, we all worked together to reach a consensus on climate change. Kyrgyzstan fully supports that global agreement, and yesterday we signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on the margins of the general debate. In Kyrgyzstan, the effects of global warming are already leading to natural disasters and extreme situations, with fluctuations in the volumes of mountain rivers, excessive melting of glaciers and the degradation of unique mountain ecosystems. All of this has led to negative social consequences and significant harm to economic sectors. We estimate that the annual damage from natural disasters in Kyrgyzstan amounts to about $35 million, rendering us in need of international assistance in adapting to climate change.\nWe are particularly concerned about the increased melting of our glaciers, which represent Central Asia\u2019s natural storage of water resources. The prediction is that by 2025 Kyrgyzstan\u2019s total glacier area could shrink by an average of 30 to 40 per cent, resulting in a drop of between 25 and 35 per cent in the volumes of our rivers. Kyrgyzstan therefore supports the undertaking of joint projects aimed at conserving glaciers in countries in our region with mountain rivers.\nOn top of that, climate change is threatening the biodiversity of our mountain ecosystems. In particular, since the 1990s, our snow leopard population has fallen by half, from 600 to 300 animals. In 2013 we held the first Global Snow Leopard Conservation Forum, which has become the starting point for cooperation among countries that have snow leopard habitats, as well as with our international partners. Next year, Kyrgyzstan will convene a second Global Forum, where we will consider the results of the work that has been done and decide on future joint action for conserving those rare animals.\nAnother serious problem that cannot be solved without the international community\u2019s participation is the presence of the numerous uranium tailings scattered throughout the countries of our region. The scale of the problem requires focused and coordinated work within the framework of resolution 68/218, entitled \u201cThe role of the international community in averting the radiation threat in Central Asia\u201d. In that connection, we have proposed holding a high-level international forum on the resolution in May or June 2017. The Kyrgyz Republic is ready to do the necessary preparatory work for the forum along with other concerned countries and international organizations, and we hope to have the support of the international community for those efforts.\nFor every State, sustainable development depends on security and stability, including at the global level. Unfortunately, the current session of the General Assembly is taking place against a backdrop of international tension in Afghanistan, the countries of the Middle East and North Africa, and Ukraine. The differences between the world\u2019s major Powers on current international political issues remain, and the pressures of sanctions persist. Such international circumstances and the confrontational attitude of some countries are not conducive to dealing with today\u2019s challenges and threats through a collective approach conducted under United Nations auspices. Rather, their global nature demands that every country, without exception, continue to cooperate and collaborate in the interests of all humankind. We believe that the world Powers must put aside their differences and pool their efforts to combat the threats to international security.\nIn an era of globalization, the processes involve other countries as well as the parties to a conflict. Kyrgyzstan is no exception. We have unfortunately not been spared by phenomena such as terrorism, extremism, religious intolerance and radicalization, although they began and evolved far beyond the borders of Kyrgyzstan. We have been obliged to act to protect the interests of the State and our citizens. However, we believe it is more effective to deal with them locally from the start, in their own breeding grounds. It is crucial that we provide international assistance to the countries that are battling the problem at the national level, including within the framework of the Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism proposed by the Secretary-General in January.\nIn combating terrorism and extremism, it is important to ensure that force is accompanied by preventive measures and intercultural dialogue. Kyrgyzstan, like every other people, ethnic group and country, has its own unique history and culture. In order to popularize the peaceful values, traditions and customs of nomadic civilization, in 2011 Kyrgyzstan launched an initiative to stage the World Nomad Games, and thus in 2014, on the shores of the mountain lake Issyk-Kul, the first-ever World Nomad Games were held. Two weeks ago, also by Issyk-Kul, we held the second World Nomad Games, in which representatives and athletes from 62 countries took part. Thousands came to watch the uniquely spectacular and original athletic contests.\nThe World Nomad Games are helping to strengthen mutual understanding and cooperation among countries and peoples from many different cultures and religions. With regard to , the Assembly\u2019s resolution on the promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace, Kyrgyzstan supports the inclusion of a provision supporting the periodic holding of the World Nomad Games, and we are counting on support for that initiative from the States Members of the United Nations.\nKyrgyzstan believes that if the countries of Central Asia are to have sustainable development and security, they must strengthen their mutual trust and cooperation. We have been compelled to confront the fact that many of the region\u2019s problems are a long way from being solved successfully and functionally. Our active efforts to provide regional security, liberalize trade regulations, encourage transit through inter-State road and rail routes and deal with other issues are not enough. Resolving border issues has to be a major factor in regional stability.\nUnfortunately, situations today in which individual States attempt to pursue their own development at other countries\u2019 expense and limit their opportunities are becoming more common. We believe that such trends should have no place in the modern civilized world. In order to truly protect the right to development, it is vital that we ensure that powerful States and transnational corporations do not dictate conditions, limit other countries\u2019 development, hinder the implementation of effective projects or, especially, interfere in their internal affairs. In a civilized world no one should prevent development for some States in order to encourage it in others. We believe that any international cooperation should be based on the principles of mutual benefit and respect for each other\u2019s interests. In order to achieve that, we believe it is vital to strengthen international law on the right of States to development.\nThe issue of the relationship between water and power in Central Asia deserves special attention. As we know, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, processes in Central Asia began to disintegrate. Mutually agreed- on arrangements for exchanging water and energy resources collapsed. Despite that, the Kyrgyz Republic has continued to accumulate water in its reservoirs at a time when prices of energy resources supplied by neighbouring countries have been increasing every year. Frankly, it has been a game with only one set of goalposts. In the circumstances, Kyrgyzstan has been obliged to switch to producing affordable, clean electrical power through its hydroelectric plants in order to provide its people with heat and electricity. We still have electricity shortages, especially in winter. Within the framework of its existing relationships, Kyrgyzstan, with its considerable reserves of fresh water, is not adequately compensated economically for the services it renders through its accumulation and storage of water resources that are important to the entire region.\nIn that connection, we believe that the countries of Central Asia should come to a unified understanding of the meaning and significance of our complex use of water and energy resources. Today the region possesses considerable potential when it comes to achieving a transition to clean energy. Implementing construction projects for hydropower stations in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan could meet the energy needs of every country in the region and thereby create favourable conditions for our sustainable development, while being fully consistent with the provisions of Sustainable Development Goal 7 regarding affordable, clean energy.\nAnother important factor in Central Asia\u2019s regional stability is finding ways to achieve the speedy settlement of border issues based on the principles and norms of international law. We call for using exclusively political and diplomatic means to resolve current regional problems peacefully, in accordance with the principles of international law, mutual understanding and compromise, without the use or threat of use of force. For its part, Kyrgyzstan remains open to dialogue and cooperation with all interested parties.\nThe role of the United Nations in our combined opposition to today\u2019s challenges and threats has grown enormously. However, alongside the Organization\u2019s growing importance, its responsibility for taking decisions on the fate of the entire world community has also grown. For all practical purposes, the 15 members of the Security Council currently make decisions about the security issues of every country on the planet. Questions of war and peace, security and stability in every corner of the world depend on the positions they collectively arrive at. On top of that, the five permanent members of the Security Council can block any decision.\nIn that regard, we believe that reform of the primary international organ of the United Nations, which should take into account the interests of a much larger majority of States, is long overdue. When the Organization was created and the founding Member States numbered only 50, limiting the membership of the Security Council to 15 was justified. But now there are 193 Member States. We believe that the expansion of democracy should not be confined to States\u2019 national borders. The time has come to introduce democratic principles into the election of members of the main organs of the United Nations, including the Security Council.\nWe should also reform the process for selecting the Secretary-General. We welcome the procedural changes whereby, for the first time in the Organization\u2019s 71-year history, all Member States have had the opportunity ahead of time to get to know the candidates for that important position, and their proposed programmes, during consultations. However, we should not stop there. We are in favour of introducing direct elections for the post of Secretary-General through a vote in the General Assembly.\nI would like to bring up another problem here. From 20 to 23 September, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) provided a platform for the claims of Kadyrzhan Batyrov, who has been convicted by the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic and sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for the serious crimes of organizing and fomenting inter-ethnic strife in 2010. In 2013 he was also cited by the Russian Federation in connection with an investigation of large-scale fraud. Kyrgyzstan and the OSCE have cooperated in achieving many brilliant successes. However, the ODIHR policy is fomenting a conflict that could lead to a destabilizing situation and unpredictable consequences in our country.\nWe are a country that has laboured to begin the process of building parliamentary democracy. We have strictly and scrupulously abided by all the OSCE and ODIHR recommendations, and will continue to do so. We believe that the aforementioned actions of the ODIHR represent a sign of extreme disrespect not only for a State\u2019s judicial system but also to the entire people of Kyrgyzstan. We can only see it as a challenge to the Kyrgyz Republic as it treads the thorny, difficult path towards building a genuine democracy. In this way, the annual meetings of ODIHR could become a platform where criminal elements who have committed very serious crimes have the right to speak. If ODIHR acts this way with regard to Kyrgyzstan and other countries today, it is possible that in future it could see representatives of the terrorists of the Islamic State, soaked in the blood of their horrific crimes against humanity, participating in its efforts. The Kyrgyz Republic fully shares the democratic values of the OSCE, and we act to uphold them. However, we categorically reject double standards and the transformation of that organization into an institution of provocation and intervention into the domestic affairs of sovereign States.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm our conviction that the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement should remain a top priority in the international community\u2019s coordinated initiatives. We must ensure that no one be left behind, and especially not the mountainous landlocked developing countries. We must vanquish the destructive forces of terrorism and extremism, which undermine peace and stability throughout the world. In this matter, we need the full cooperation of leading world Powers. They should also stop imposing sanctions on each other, as that affects other countries.\nThe role of the United Nations in our joint efforts to counter contemporary challenges and threats is becoming increasingly significant. We call for full support for and a strengthening of our Organization to collectively address global challenges to advance sustainable development.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. Allow me also to thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his tireless efforts throughout his presidency during the seventieth session. I would also like to extend special thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We thank him for his annual report on the work of the Organization (A/71/1) and for the high priority that he has given to the issues of the Middle East and Lebanon.\nI take this opportunity to reiterate Lebanon\u2019s commitment to assuming its role in achieving the lofty goals of the Organization. My country had the honour to have been among its founding Members. Foremost among those goals is the maintenance of peace and security, the promotion of world peace, securing the right of peoples to self-determination and ensuring respect for human rights.\nIn 2016 we have witnessed tremendous international efforts to mobilize goodwill, reduce the number of armed conflicts and strengthen communities. Such efforts have come about either under the auspices or with the contribution of the United Nations, with the goal of improving the international community\u2019s ability to meet the unprecedented challenges that are the mark of our era. Perhaps the most noble milestones were the signing by 175 States of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which took place in April, and the holding of the World Humanitarian Summit, which was held in Istanbul in May.\nLebanon emphasizes the need to reactivate and revitalize the role of the General Assembly so as to make it more effective in addressing issues of concern to the whole of humankind. Lebanon laments that the Security Council has repeatedly failed to address the conflicts raging in many countries, particularly in the Middle East. Lebanon stresses the importance of reforming the Security Council in a way that would reflect the latest political, economic and demographic realities emerging in our world.\nMy country is undergoing a severe political crisis, the most salient aspect of which is the inability of Parliament for the past two and a half years to elect a President of the Republic. The crisis has led to the near paralysis of the legislative authorities and the slowdown of the work of the executive branch. It has also had negative repercussions on our economic situation.\nAll countries that consider themselves brothers and friends of Lebanon \u2014 all those who are familiar with the Lebanese scene \u2014 are well aware of the specificities of the political situation in my country and the extent to which it is influenced by external factors. The main external factor has been sharp regional polarization, which has turned into an open conflict in the entire region. Realism compels us to recognize that the solution to the problem of the presidential vacancy is not just in the hands of the Lebanese. I therefore call on all of Lebanon\u2019s friends and supporters and all who are keen to avoid the emergence of a new area of tension in the Middle East to help the Lebanese elect a President of the country. The election of a new President will help rebalance our constitutional institutions and protect the Lebanese model of coexistence, which is the last surviving model based on plurality in the Levant.\nWe reiterate that the distressing war in Syria has produced a displacement crisis that has imposed an unbearable burden on Lebanon that exceeds our capacities. My country, with its limited surface area, is hosting numbers of displaced Syrians equivalent to one third of our population. We are shouldering our humanitarian duty towards those people with our limited resources and with insufficient support from the international community. We are disappointed with the level of international response to our needs as a host country \u2014 a response that is not commensurate with the pledges made or the goodwill expressed on so many occasions.\nLebanon cannot and will not assimilate additional displaced persons. Lebanon urges the United Nations to craft an overarching vision for resettling displaced Syrians living in our territory in areas inside Syria and for working with the parties concerned to turn such a vision into a workable plan at the earliest possible time. As we await the realization of that plan, we stress once more the temporary character of the Syrian presence in Lebanon. Let me declare that Lebanon is not a country of permanent asylum. Lebanon is the homeland of the Lebanese and only the Lebanese.\nLebanon continues to suffer from the threat of terrorism. Lebanon is engaged in an open confrontation with terrorism \u2014 a confrontation for which we have paid dearly with the lives of our soldiers, civilians and children. We declare a commitment to fight the scourge in all its forms. We stress the importance of regional and international cooperation in that fight.\nWe believe that the isolationist tendencies of some communities \u2014 retreating behind separation walls with the unhealthy encouragement of Islamophobia \u2014 are aimed at an Islam that is being deceitfully brandished and branded by terrorists to justify their crimes. Such isolationist tendencies do not represent a panacea against terrorism. Rather, they are a recipe for the emergence of violent, extremist and racist tendencies, which have been rejected by advanced democracies for a long time. Combating terrorism is a long-term process that requires major efforts at all levels. A precondition for the successful elimination of the terrorist phenomenon lies in eradicating its roots and the contributing factors that fuel it. We ought to address deprivation and injustice, which are the incubators of extremism, by meeting the legitimate demands of people for freedom, dignity and equality and by rejecting all forms of violence and exclusion.\nOn the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon reiterates its commitment to that resolution with all its provisions. Once again, Lebanon calls on the international community to compel Israel to cease its violations of Lebanese sovereignty, to fully cooperate with the United Nations peacekeeping forces and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, to demarcate what is left of the Blue Line and to withdraw from the northern part of Ghajar, the Shaba\u2019a farmlands and the Kfar Shouba Hills.\nLebanon reiterates its strong determination to safeguard its full rights over its water and natural resources, including oil and gas, within its exclusive economic zone. Lebanon called on the Secretary- General, during his visit to Beirut last March, to make use of his good offices in resolving the issue of the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone between Lebanon and Israel. We look forward to his heightened role in that area.\nWe condemn Israel\u2019s continuing occupation of the Palestinian land and its blockade of the Gaza Strip, as well as its obstruction of the efforts to rebuild what was destroyed by the Israeli aggression in the summer of 2014. We call for the principle of legal accountability to be applied in the case of the war crimes committed by Israel, to prevent those crimes from going unpunished.\nWe hold Israel responsible for foiling all attempts to reach a peaceful settlement, and we stress the need for a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the conflict, based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the Madrid terms of reference, including the principle of land for peace, and the Arab Peace Initiative. We furthermore stress the right of Palestinian refugees to return home, pursuant to international resolutions.\nAt this very moment, as I speak before the Assembly, a major cycle of violence continues to rage in the Arab Levant, causing the destruction of homes and livelihoods, hospitals and places of worship. Communities are being uprooted from their homelands and hurled into the abyss of an unknown future. Great cities are being razed to the ground and erased from the map without any consideration for their historical importance, or indeed their human heritage value.\nWe renew our call to all influential Powers to cease procrastinating and hesitating and to assume their responsibilities by acting with determination to stop the bloodshed and restore security and stability in our region. We appeal to everyone to join wholeheartedly and effectively in the fight against obscurantist terrorism. We warn against the dangers of tampering with maps, demolishing existing entities and changing the demographic nature of communities or threatening their social cohesion and religious diversity.\nWe believe that the main prerequisite for consolidating stability and eliminating hotbeds of extremism in the Middle East is to meet the just demands of the people to live independently, with dignity and freedom, and to find a just solution to the Palestinian cause. We would like to stress the importance of establishing peaceful relations among the countries of the region, based on good-neighbourliness, respect for the sovereignty of other countries and the principle of non-interference in their internal affairs. We call for the promotion of the culture of peace and dialogue to protect the oases of diversity in the Levant.\nAmid the violent maelstrom that is sweeping across the Levant, where everything is in flux and endless waves of displaced persons are leaving their homes and communities, a small entity called Lebanon stands firm against the aftershocks of the crisis that is tearing everything apart around it, and offers the world a model other than that which is intended to prove the inability of our region to tolerate the possibility of coexistence among different entities.\nLebanon is a shining star, an example of affinity among various affiliations and a model totally opposed to the notion of a single-colour racist State that rejects all other shades. It is a laboratory of partnership at a time when sects, nationalities and ethnicities are fighting one another and populations are fleeing their countries. Yet that model is suffering from political weakness and needs the world to offer it a helping hand. Meanwhile, the Lebanese people will remain in the heart of the oppressed Levant \u2014 firmly committed to living together in one unified State.\n"

        "file_text": "The tenor of our times is change \u2014 accelerating at a pace and on a scale unprecedented in all of human history. In less than a generation, billions have been lifted out of poverty, and billions more have been enabled to connect to each other and to a world of knowledge and ideas in a manner barely imaginable a generation ago. Economic freedom between markets and within them, supercharged by the Internet, innovation and technology, has made possible the longest run of economic progress in the history of the world.\nThere are threats. At the meeting of the Group of Twenty we focused on how to resist the rising tide of protectionism, which is not a ladder to escape the low-growth trap, but a shovel to dig it deeper. But most important of all is the threat of conflict and instability. Where there is peace and the rule of law applies to both governors and governed, to both large States and small, we have seen remarkable strides in every measure of human progress. But in too many places there is no peace \u2014 wars that seem to have no end, intractable disorder that, in a connected world where technology has trumped geography, affects us all.\nAnd yet despite setbacks to secure lasting peace, notably in Syria, over the past five years the United Nations system has produced a global Arms Trade Treaty, a pivotal global agreement on climate change, a transformational set of Sustainable Development Goals and a global blueprint for disaster-risk reduction. These successes add to the less high-profile, but hugely important work of the United Nations in the field \u2014 whether it be vaccinating children, helping subsistence farmers to improve their crop yields, facilitating democratic elections or delivering emergency humanitarian support. They demonstrate the approach we need to take as we face the challenges of the future.\nWe need strength to respond firmly and decisively in the face of tyranny and abuse, to stand up to those who seek to divide societies through terror or to exploit desperation for their own benefit. We need compassion to assist those less fortunate than ourselves and to help rebuild communities that have been devastated by war or natural disasters. And now, more than ever, we need to work together towards common solutions.\nThat is why Australia\u2019s response to the global surge in migration is based on three pillars. First is strong border controls, with effective measures to combat people-smuggling and terrorism, supported by a planned migration programme. Second is a compassionate humanitarian policy, one that does not focus merely on the numbers that we take in, but offers substantial resettlement programmes and supports those countries hosting large numbers of refugees themselves. The third pillar is effective international and regional cooperation. These three pillars are inherently interlinked. They cannot and do not work in isolation. We believe that in order to secure and maintain public support for immigration, multiculturalism and a generous humanitarian programme, the public needs to know that it is their own Government that controls their borders.\nIn the year before Australia\u2019s strong border protection policies were introduced, over 25,000 irregular migrants arrived in Australia by boat. Over 1,200 people tragically died as a result, the victims of the criminal enterprises that prey on vulnerable people for profit. Without policies to ensure that we can decide who enters Australia, it would not have been possible for our Government to maintain the world\u2019s third- largest permanent refugee resettlement programme. It would not have been possible for Australia to commit to taking an additional 12,000 refugees displaced by the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, or to increase our broader humanitarian intake by more than 35 per cent.\nWe are one of the most successful multicultural societies in the world. We are both as old as the oldest continuous human culture of our first Australians and as young as the child in the arms of her migrant parents. We are not defined by race, religion or culture, but by shared political values of democracy, the rule of law and equality of opportunity \u2014 a \u201cfair go\u201d. More than a quarter of us were born overseas, almost half of us have a parent born overseas, and each year we welcome around 200,000 permanent migrants to join our 24 million. We have a long experience of, and commitment to, settlement services to ensure that our immigrants, especially refugees, become successfully integrated into our society. We are indeed a nation of immigrants who are as diverse as the society that they have joined.\nOne such story is that of Aliir Aliir, who grew up in a refugee camp in Kenya after his family fled the bloody civil war in the Sudan. For Aliir, his family, and 150,000 other men, women and children, the Kakuma refugee camp was home. The camp provided the bare necessities of meals and shelter, but sports equipment was unimaginable. Aliir and his friends would improvise with a balloon wrapped in strips of old clothing to serve as a football. He was seven when he and his family came to Australia. Tall, fast and agile, Aliir was a natural for Australian Rules Football, and he has not looked back since he took up the game. Earlier this year, I was delighted when Aliir debuted for the Australian Football League (AFL) team I support, the Sydney Swans. Now 22, Aliir is one of the first Sudanese immigrants to play for the AFL and has become a role model in our multicultural nation, especially for young people in Sydney. There are thousands of migrant stories like Aliir\u2019s \u2014 leaders of Government, of business, of science and of the arts.\nAustralia would not be the country it is today without their contribution. Their stories are our stories, their successes are our successes. Of course, each country must adopt approaches that meet the needs of its own population and geography. But Australia\u2019s experience sheds some light on what the solutions are \u2014 strong borders, vigilant security agencies governed by the rule of law, and a steadfast commitment to the shared values of freedom and mutual respect. These are the ingredients of multicultural success. And they are lessons we can share to drive more effective, coordinated approaches to meet our humanitarian responsibilities.\nThat is why the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), adopted here at the United Nations on Monday to drive a more orderly and coordinated approach to migration and refugees, is so important. And that is why Australia and Indonesia, as Co-Chairs of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, are working with the countries of our region to protect migrants in vulnerable situations and to combat people-smuggling.\nNow we need to see the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, or as we fondly imagine it once was. Secure borders are essential. Porous borders drain away public support for multiculturalism, for immigration and for aid to refugees. Most important of all, the only way to stop the scourge of people-smuggling is to deprive the people-smugglers of their product, and secure borders do just that.\nAnother fact we must recognize is that, while it would be desirable for more nations to increase their humanitarian intake, as Australia is doing, the truth is that the scale of the refugee and internally displaced persons problem is so great \u2014 65 million \u2014 that resettlement in other countries can never come close to being near enough. The most urgent priority is to re-establish stability and ensure security in the regions of conflict and, in addition, ensure that there are greater opportunities for economic advancement in the source countries of so much of this irregular migration. All of this requires cooperation, and that includes, as noted in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, the willingness of Member States to accept the return of their citizens who do not qualify for protection, whether on a voluntary or involuntary basis.\nRegional and national initiatives are crucial in our response to the surge in displaced people. Ultimately, we will find sustainable solutions only by addressing the root causes and drivers of this displacement. The largest of these are conflict and instability. Conflict \u2014 in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Libya, Yemen and other countries \u2014 is taking an unprecedented toll on innocent civilians who, like all of us, wish to live their lives and raise their families in peace and security.\nAustralia\u2019s armed forces are supporting the Government of Iraq in its efforts to liberate its territories from Da\u2019esh. In defence of Iraq, we are joining with our coalition partners to defeat Da\u2019esh in Syria. It is of vital importance that Da\u2019esh\u2019s so-called caliphate is defeated in the field. As Nadia Murad said on Monday in the General Assembly (see A/71/PV.3), we must defeat these terrorists, these monsters, who killed or enslaved her family, once and for all. Our support has helped to put Da\u2019esh on the back foot \u2014 it has now lost around 50 per cent of its territory in Iraq.\nBut conflict resolution is not enough. Establishing and maintaining a credible peace in the aftermath of conflict is just as important. In that regard, the United Nations must play a vital role in building and sustaining peace.\nAustralia is proud to have worked with Angola to facilitate a resolution to reform the United Nations peacebuilding architecture. As the sixth-largest donor in 2015, Australia is pleased to be a key supporter of the Peacebuilding Fund, which provides crucial assistance to peace agreements and supports capacity-building and rule-of-law projects in post-conflict societies. The United Nations role illustrates that vigilance against the risk of new conflicts requires investing in and protecting the international rules-based order.\nWe were all reminded of that recently when North Korea launched three medium-range ballistic missiles. Days later, Pyongyang conducted what we understand to be its largest-ever nuclear test. The provocative and dangerous actions of this rogue State breach unanimously agreed Security Council resolutions and threaten global peace and security. This shows why it was important for Australia and Myanmar to secure agreement at the East Asia Summit on a new commitment to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to work to support non-proliferation. Such provocation requires action, and Australia will work with the Security Council to support additional sanctions against North Korea.\nIt is this maturity and honesty that Australia would bring to the Human Rights Council should we be elected for our first-ever term, from 2018 to 2020. Rather than denying problems, we will seek to identify them, address them and learn from them. And we will hold others to the same standard as we hold ourselves.\nAustralia has prioritized five key areas in our approach to human rights: gender equality, governance, freedom of expression, the rights of indigenous peoples, and strong national human rights institutions and capacity-building. We are committed to providing principled and pragmatic leadership across these five areas \u2014 both through our actions at home and our advocacy and cooperation abroad. Over the course of the next decade and beyond, working together to combat terrorism and conflict, prevent global health pandemics, ensure universal access to clean water and sanitation, and address climate change will require enhanced global cooperation.\nI do not need to reiterate the significance and complexity of the threat of climate change. We all understand what is at stake: the future of generations around the globe and the well-being of our planet itself. If we are to be successful, we must all, every one of us, act together to build a better world. And we are. The Paris Agreement last year was a shining example of global cooperation for the common good. In a historic display of commitment, over 170 nations signed the Paris Agreement in New York in April. Even more have submitted plans for action, and Australia will play its part. We are committed to ratifying the Paris Agreement, and we are confident that we will meet our ambitious 2030 target of cutting our per capita emissions by 52 per cent \u2014 just as we will meet and beat our Kyoto Protocol commitments.\nAustralia has also increased the profile of climate change in our overseas aid programme, including through our $200 million commitment to the Green Climate Fund, because we know climate change amplifies many development challenges. We also know that our commitment to action creates new opportunities for innovation and growth, which means more jobs.\nWe are combining reductions in emissions with strong economic growth, which, from a rate of 2 per cent a year ago, has been running at 3.3 per cent over the past year. Our new cities policy, too, is focused on clean development, enhanced amenity, sustainability and livability. And, as the land of droughts and flooding rains, we have learned how to make every drop count and share our experience in water management with other nations, including earlier today at the High-level Panel on Water.\nIt would be remiss of me not to offer our deepest thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and his commitment to addressing, over the past decade, so many of the challenges I have mentioned here. The Secretary-General leaves an important legacy that his successor must now take forward with the international community. And as his successor does so, we, the United Nations, must stay the course. We must remain committed to displaying sufficient strength and courage to do what is needed in the face of great adversity. We must continue to show the compassion and understanding needed to ensure that our societies are inclusive, diverse and resilient. And we must continue to cooperate at the regional and international levels to find common solutions to these global challenges. I am confident that together, as the United Nations, we will ensure a better future for all.\n"

        "file_text": "Before I came here, Sahar Afzal, a representative of Dutch youth, asked me a simple question. \u201cMinister,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you still believe in the United Nations?\u201d That question made me think. A plain and simple yes is the answer one would probably expect from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a nation with a strong tradition of cooperation, dialogue and partnership and a founding Member of the United Nations, with an active commitment to peace, justice and development. But my answer was not that simple. The English art critic Clive Bell wrote that while we believe, what we believe is not necessarily true. There can be a lot of wishful thinking in believing something. Believing is not always enough. It is what we do that matters. And so it is when we look at the United Nations, as the world\u2019s premier global multilateral organization.\nThere is widespread agreement that the United Nations needs to reassert and transform itself, and I think that is correct. The challenges are enormous; according to some, the world is at a tipping point. And the outlook is indeed gloomy. Geopolitical fault lines are deepening. Shifts in the global economy are fuelling tension and uncertainty. Growth has stagnated. Inequality within and among countries has grown. Worldwide, the number of refugees is the highest it has been since the founding of the United Nations. Promising democracy movements have turned into bloody conflicts, and new wars have broken out, the most tragic examples being the conflict in Syria and the brutal extremism of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Terrorism has taken a deadly toll in many places around the world, including on my continent, Europe. Violence against women in war zones and elsewhere is a scourge.\nThere is no denying it \u2014 too many people in the world have drawn the short straw. In a world of globalization, climate change and conflict, they are losing out. The longer we permit that to go on, the further we drift from the inclusive United Nations ideal of \u201cwe the peoples\u201d. Not \u201cwe, some people\u201d, but \u201cwe the peoples\u201d. Will we be able to strengthen our positive forces, or will we let the negative forces tear the world apart? At this pivotal moment in history, the United Nations and the other institutions that were built to bring us together must be strong enough to prevent that from happening. But are they? The idea of unstoppable, progressive global integration has lost its aura of inevitability. On my own continent, the process of European cooperation is being debated. In many places inside and outside Europe, ghosts of the past have come back to haunt us \u2014 nationalism and xenophobia. And when I see the kinds of stories about the United Nations that are being reported in my own country, the Netherlands \u2014 which has traditionally been a very strong supporter \u2014 I realize that the United Nations is too often seen as helpless and fragmented, an overwhelmed Organization struggling to cope with the challenges it faces.\nAnd yet the United Nations has no choice but to play a key role in delivering solutions, now and in future, in order to make the world safer, more just and better prepared for what the future brings. There is no alternative. The United Nations is the best imperfect global Organization we have, the only global Organization that embodies the principles of multilateralism \u2014 legitimacy, universality and standard-setting authority and that has not only convening power, which is very important, but also the ability to deliver services on a global scale.\nWhat must be done? As the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and, only this week, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) have shown, the United Nations remains the one legitimate institution where international goals and ambitions are set and where we can agree on new global challenges. But now is the time for implementation. We must walk the talk. I know that implementation is not always very sexy. It does not often make headlines. It is not usually accompanied by Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo or Shakira singing onstage, as they did last year in this very Hall during the magnificent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. But implementation is necessary to deliver on the goals we set, and it is necessary for the Organization to remain relevant and credible \u2014 to survive.\nThat is why I believe that a shift from outcome documents to action and execution should be the top priority of both the United Nations membership and the new Secretary-General. The new Secretary- General should be an \u201cImplementer-General\u201d, working on the basis of a twenty-first-century vision of global cooperation. There is plenty of work to do. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is leaving his successor an impressive body of standards, objectives and recommendations, and the Netherlands is grateful for his enormous leadership during a very difficult period. The new Secretary-General can hit the ground running and boost further implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, of peacekeeping and peacebuilding reform, including real zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as the very important issue of reform of the United Nations development system.\nBut the Secretary-General cannot do it alone. The membership must shoulder its responsibilities. At a time of so many false notes, we need to work on our global orchestra. Maybe the States Members of the United Nations should declare a moratorium on new and lofty outcome documents until we have delivered on the commitments and promises made in the ones that we already have adopted. Let us pause in the talk for a while and get the action going for the people whom we represent.\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is ready to support the new Secretary-General in a drive for implementation. Implementation is not just technique; it is mastering the political will to get things done. We have made a good start with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in our own country. We look forward to sharing our national voluntary presentation with the membership next summer. Globally, we are committed to an integrated approach to peace and security, development and human rights that leaves no one behind. The Netherlands is a top-10 humanitarian donor, a supporter of and a contributor to peacekeeping. We will ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change shortly. We would like the migration compact and the refugee compact provided for in the New York Declaration on Migrants and Refugees to be clear and actionable.\nUnited Nations reform needs to pick up steam now. The Security Council continues to fulfil a crucial role, imperfect as it may be. But it is no longer 1945. The Council is simply not representative enough. We need to devise a way to fix that shortcoming before it is too late, even if it means thinking outside the box. As the Assembly may recall, I have suggested that a Council seat be assigned to the European Union in due course, and I invite other regions to also reflect on collective regional representation on the Council.\nThe right of the veto should not render the Security Council powerless, especially when \u2014 as we see every day, including this week \u2014 mass atrocities are being committed. Council members should be more conscious of their responsibilities and be held more accountable if they block action against breaches of international humanitarian law. Last year\u2019s important reviews \u2014 and I think they were very important \u2014 of peace operations and peacebuilding underline the primacy of political solutions and of sustaining the peace. I could not agree more.\nMore focus on conflict prevention is also needed. Indeed, this community has been underlining the need for conflict prevention for 50 years. Successful preventive diplomacy can keep situations of concern from spiralling out of control. It can keep cases from being added to the Council\u2019s agenda; once a case is taken up by the Security Council \u2014 let us face it \u2014 we in a sense have already collectively failed. We need to make sure that there are sufficient resources for political missions, mediation and other preventive actions. In its recent report, the Independent Commission on Multilateralism recommends a fundraising drive for prevention. While that is an admirable suggestion, I would say that what is needed is not fundraising for prevention, but budgeting for prevention. If we agree that conflict prevention is crucial to the mandate of the United Nations, then we must devote sufficient resources to it from the regular budget, through assessed contributions by all Member States and not just through the extrabudgetary generosity of a few. That may require a thorough review and reprioritization of the way in which budget resources are allocated at the United Nations.\nThe points that I am making are part of an integrated approach that my country has long advocated, including during our previous term on the Security Council. We intend to pursue that approach during our 2018 Council term as well. Conflicts cannot be resolved unless the root causes are addressed. Peace, justice and development are closely interlinked and should not be dealt with in isolation. The Peacebuilding Fund, which was established in 2005, is a good example of an integrated approach to sustaining peace, as the great pledging conference that we held yesterday illustrates. I am pleased to say that, earlier this week, the Netherlands pledged \u20ac10 million to the Fund. The growing recognition of the importance of accountability is another example. There can be no durable peace without justice and respect for human rights. Tomorrow I will deposit the instrument of ratification of the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on the crime of aggression.\nOther Security Council priorities for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2018 include the protection of civilians and addressing the peace and security implications of climate change. As a Kingdom consisting of one low-lying country, the Netherlands, and three small Caribbean island countries, Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten, that is an issue of particular concern to us.\nFortunately, the grim tableau that I sketched a moment ago is not the whole picture. There has been genuine and significant progress. In the past 20 years, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has been halved. That was one of the Millennium Development Goals, which we achieved well before the 2015 deadline. I remember that many of us in this Hall believed that that would not be possible. Well, that Goal was reached.\nSometimes lightning does strike twice. The international community has reached agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Another major achievement and a victory for diplomacy in a time of so much strife is the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. With the recent ratifications by China and the United States, there is a real prospect that it will enter into force, hopefully before Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon leaves office at the end of this year. That is in large part his legacy, and we commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for it.\nAnd, yes, there have also been positive developments in the area of security. New and important work has been undertaken to stop foreign terrorist fighters from travelling to conflict zones, to halt the financing of terrorism, to impose sanctions on ISIS, and to work in communities on deradicalization and local support, putting together hard and soft security. The Netherlands, together with Morocco, is trying to do its part as co-Chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Preventing violent extremism is now also high on our United Nations agenda, thanks to the Secretary- General\u2019s plan of action.\nAnd, yes, peacekeeping has evolved and has been transformed from traditional ceasefire monitoring missions into very complex missions with integrated mandates. More attention is being paid to the entire spectrum of peacekeeping, from early warning and prevention to peacebuilding in the fragile post-conflict period. And more consideration is being given to the protection of civilians \u2014 the goal of peacekeeping missions \u2014 including the tackling of gender and sexual abuse and the important task of establishing the rule of law.\nThat is not just theory or statistics. Ask the 12,000 people who sought refuge at the United Nations compound in Bor, South Sudan. Head of Mission Ken Payumo had the courage to let them in and protect them. Ask the women of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where, thanks to the gender unit in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission, sexual violence has decreased substantially since 2013. Ask the people of Nepal, where, in 2006, the United Nations helped the Seven-Party Alliance to sustain the peaceful solution to the conflict.\nAllow me to briefly go back to the previous term of the Netherlands on the Security Council. Our first meeting was on Sunday, 2 January 1999, when the Council convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon. A United Nations-chartered plane had just been shot down in war-ravaged Angola. United Nations personnel were being held hostage by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Two decades later, Angola has seen substantial improvements; it is currently a non-permanent member of the Council. Or take Sierra Leone, another country that was frequently on the Council\u2019s agenda that year. The international community helped to broker a peace agreement and put in place a large peacekeeping operation. In 2004, a United Nations-backed war crimes court, located in the Netherlands, began trying senior leaders on both sides of the conflict. Sierra Leone now has a democratically elected President and, with international support, is emerging from the recent Ebola crisis.\nIn all these cases, we can see the results of hard work, sustained effort and prolonged investment by the international community. Those are results that should make us proud and hopeful. But such successes soon fade from the public mind when they are replaced by images of children suffering the trauma of wars for which they are not responsible. We cannot deny that there have been peace and security failures. The list has the power to shock: Rwanda, Srebrenica. Now it includes Yemen and, of course, Syria, with Aleppo as a terrifying symbol.\nThe number-one priority now is to restore the cessation of hostilities and ensure humanitarian access. I call upon the parties most closely involved to do everything in their power to make that happen as soon as possible. And I call upon them, as I have done before, to ensure proper and transparent monitoring of any such cessation of hostilities. If non-compliance becomes the norm, how can we expect Syrians to trust the international community and to put their faith in the United Nations system?\nIn resolution 2254 (2015), the Security Council unanimously expressed its support for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria. If violence continues to be the norm, I urge the Council not to remain silent. Like my French colleague, I wish to ensure better monitoring and follow-up when a ceasefire is breached. At the International Syria Support Group, which will meet this afternoon, we will call for more qualitative and transparent monitoring and for the systematic violations of ceasefires to be dealt with by the Security Council.\nAt the same time, let us not forget the primacy of politics. While we work frantically to relieve the tragic humanitarian situation, work on a political transition plan for Syria should go ahead, since only a political solution can end the horrific tragedy. We wholeheartedly support the outstanding efforts by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Staffan de Mistura, and others to that end.\nWhat is the value of the United Nations and where is its credibility if we talk about the responsibility to protect but are not capable of resolving the Syrian conflict or ready to answer the call by the High Commissioner for Human Rights for an independent international investigation into serious human rights violations in Yemen?\nIn conclusion, what we do matters greatly. That is why I have stressed the need for an era of genuine implementation under the guidance of an \u201cImplementer- General\u201d. But how we talk about the United Nations also matters. By that I mean we must tell the real story, the whole story. We should not simply paint the usual gloomy picture of a powerless United Nations. We need to counter the entrenched view that the Organization is simply a burden to be borne and a scapegoat for our failures. The United Nations can be greater than the sum of its parts only if we allow it to be. And we must \u2014 there is too much at stake.\nFinally, let me return to the question that I was asked: do I still believe in the United Nations? My answer was yes, but only if we show the determination and resolve of which the Charter speaks. The agenda is clear. The goals have been set. Now is the time to implement and deliver.\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands will continue to do its part and will remain a steadfast supporter of the United Nations and its institutions, as it has been since the Organization\u2019s inception. It is with that in mind that we are cooperating closely with Italy to prepare for membership of the Security Council.\n"

        "file_text": "As the first representative of the new Government of Myanmar to speak before the Assembly, it is my duty and my privilege to reaffirm our faith and confidence in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The strength of the Organization lies in its universality and legitimacy, anchored in the Charter and in the fundamental principles of international law. For all its imperfections and limitations, the United Nations remains a receptacle of our hopes for a more peaceful and prosperous world, a kinder, more compassionate home for all humankind.\nMy country joined the United Nations as the newly independent Union of Burma in 1948. It was an era of determined hope, when the peoples of the world rose out of the ravages of war to build anew their countries and their faith in the human capacity for achieving peace with egalitarianism, prosperity with justice. Now, once again, it is a time of determined hope for Myanmar. When our people cast the overwhelming majority of their votes in favour of the National League for Democracy during the elections in November 2015, they were demonstrating their support, not just for a political party, but for a political culture founded on a belief in their right and their capacity to fashion the future of the country in the shape of their dreams and aspirations. And those dreams and aspirations echo the dreams and aspirations that led to the founding of the United Nations.\nThe dream of turning swords into ploughshares \u2014 or, to use a more modern idiom, converting weapons of destruction into farm machinery \u2014 is one that our people, who have long been compelled to sacrifice their sleep and their fields to the exigencies of conflict, understand in their hearts and their minds. To be safe in our own homes, to be confident in our capacity to realize our full potential, to be happy in the promise of progress for our young and security for our elderly, to be strong in our rights and duties as citizens of a peaceful and prosperous Union \u2014 those are our simple aspirations. They are simple, but, it hardly needs to be said, not easy to achieve. And the only path that will lead us to our goals is the path of peace, the path that we must follow with hope and determination.\nThe people of Myanmar have long been deprived of their inherent right to live in peace and security, to fundamental freedom and to development \u2014 to sustainable development, in the context of the Goals of our 2030 Agenda. For a country that has experienced over six decades of internal armed conflict, nothing is more important than the achievement of lasting peace and national reconciliation. It is a difficult and complex task and one which the new Government of Myanmar is taking on as a major challenge and a high priority.\nRecently, we convened the first session of the Union Peace Conference, also known as the 21st Century Panglong Conference, as it embodies the spirit of Panglong, the 1947 conference that paved the way to the founding of the independent Union of Burma. Attended by representatives of the Government, Parliament, armed forces, ethnic armed groups, political parties and civil society organizations, the Union Peace Conference is based on the principle of inclusiveness and embodies the spirit of Union. The Conference is not an end in itself. It is the first vital step on our journey to national reconciliation and lasting peace that will save succeeding generations from the scourge of fraternal strife, which has brought untold sorrow to our peoples.\nOver the past few years, the world has focused its attention on the situation in the country\u2019s Rakhine state. As a responsible member of the community of nations, we do not fear international scrutiny. We are committed to a sustainable solution that will lead to peace, stability and development for all communities within the state.\nOur Government is taking a holistic approach that makes development central to both short- and long-term programmes aimed at promoting understanding and trust. The Central Committee for the Implementation of Peace, Stability and Development in Rakhine State was established soon after our new Government took office. The working committees established under the Central Committee are undertaking the tasks of establishing security, peace and stability, and rule of law; scrutinizing immigration and citizenship; facilitating settlements and implementing socioeconomic development; and coordinating and cooperating with United Nations agencies and international organizations in providing humanitarian assistance. To buttress our efforts to address the issue comprehensively and more effectively, we have also established the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, chaired by Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nThere has been persistent opposition from some quarters to the establishment of the Commission. However, we are determined to persevere in our endeavour to achieve harmony, peace and prosperity in Rakhine state. Here, I would like to take the opportunity to ask for the understanding and constructive contribution of the international community. By standing firm against the forces of prejudice and intolerance, we are reaffirming our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person.\nPeace and national reconciliation are prerequisites for the successful implementation of policies and programmes aimed at fulfilling the social and economic needs of our people. Myanmar\u2019s 2016 national economic and development policy is designed to meet many of the Sustainable Development Goals, including those concerning the enhancement of infrastructure investment, agriculture, the private sector, small and medium-sized enterprises and, in particular, poverty alleviation. National reconciliation, job creation and conservation of natural resources, capacity-building and creating opportunities for the young are the key objectives of our people-centred inclusive policy. Many of our shared concerns as Members of the United Nations have already been discussed comprehensively in the Assembly since the general debate opened yesterday. Mindful of the President\u2019s exhortation to keep within the limits of the time allotted to each of us, I will therefore touch upon just a few issues: migration, terrorism, nuclear disarmament. I asked my delegation how it would be if I spoke for less than 15 minutes, and they assured me that it would make everybody very happy.\nDurable solutions to problems can be found only by investigating their roots. The unprecedented scale of migration in recent years and the consequent sufferings make it an imperative to address the two most important causes of irregular migration: lack of peace and lack of development. While talking about building peace and development, we cannot neglect the important aspect of enhancing respect for human rights, equality, diversity and tolerance with a balanced implementation of multidimensional economic policies. It is a challenging task, and there is a need for countries to work in collaboration with each other to seek just and comprehensive solutions in compliance with international law.\nMigrants contribute to the economies of their host countries and to the global economy. I therefore believe that building cooperation and collaboration between the host country and the country of origin in ensuring the rights of migrant workers will be mutually reinforcing for both. Our planet is a place to be shared by all. Sharing values and wealth will create a better world for all of us.\nWe must be united in standing against all forms and manifestations of violent extremism related to religious, cultural and social intolerance. Having identified extremism as a root of terrorism, we need to explore the causes of extremism. Lack of social and economic security are, no doubt, important factors, but I believe that we also need to consider the possibility that lack of purpose, of a sense of direction in life, could be a force that drives many, especially the young, into the snare of ideologies that appear to offer certainty.\nMyanmar advocates a world free of nuclear weapons. The annual resolution tabled by my country on nuclear disarmament aims at achieving peace and security for present and future generations. Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the world contributes to this goal. I am happy to inform the Assembly that we will be depositing our instrument of ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty this afternoon.\nWe have known the cost of contention and suffered the wounds of strife. It is something that we do not wish for anybody or any country in our world. I would like to thank all those who have helped us along our road to build a truly democratic federal union. It has been a hard road and we have been helped by compassion, by loving kindness and by understanding. We would like to see these qualities displayed more often in addressing the problems of our world today. I have witnessed too much anger, hatred, resentment, and demands for rather than offers of service. We would like our world to be a kinder world, one that places giving above receiving.\nWe are taught in Burma that the causes of corruption are greed, anger, fear and ignorance. I am not talking of corruption as simply the offering or taking of bribes, but rather the corruption of human nature. Anger, greed, fear and ignorance corrupt human nature, and as a result our whole world is corrupted. I would like to call on all to help us in making the world a truly better place for us to live in, and for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren to live in. Where but in this gathering of nations can I make such an appeal? So, I appeal to all to stand up against anger and hatred, against fear and ignorance, and to find a way to build a better world through our capacity for compassion and loving kindness, and our ability to be happy in the good fortune of others.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to deliver to the General Assembly a message from the His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingb\u00e9, President of the Togolese Republic.\n\u201cIt is with a feeling of shared joy that we take part in the seventy-first session of the General Assembly dedicated to the theme \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. First of all, I would like to express my congratulations to Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\n\u201cI also wish to pay tribute to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, who has worked tirelessly to strengthen the work of our Organization during the past decade. Mr. Ban Ki-moon was able to successfully guide the United Nations in the process towards the design and adoption of a new framework that will lead the Organization and the people of the planet for the next 15 years. I am speaking of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\u201cA year ago, we adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim of transforming the world. Since then, we have together begun the process of implementing the 2030 Agenda to build a more prosperous, inclusive and secure world. I am therefore happy to see the relevance of the central theme submitted to Member States, because the realization of the SDGs definitely requires a new impetus of our countries individually and collectively and a resolute commitment by the entire international community.\n\u201cAt the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in July, Togo, a pilot country for the Sustainable Development Goals, offered to participate in an exercise on the advancement of the integration of the SDGs into the strategies and national development programmes. On that occasion, we were able to show progress in the implementation of our SDG road map, and we were also able to share the significant progress we have made in the implementation of key actions to leave no one behind.\n\u201cSpecifically, our country has made significant progress in economic growth, the reduction of poverty and the promotion of peaceful democracy, and remains determined to do everything we can to ensure genuine, inclusive and sustainable growth. Because of that determination, we launched, with national financing and the assistance of United Nations Development Programme, the implementation of an emergency community development programme to help significantly improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable populations in our society.\n\u201cMoreover, the encouragement we received in the progress in the area of human development, such as recognition by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of the Togolese programme on the fighting hunger and malnutrition, inspires our enthusiasm to intensify investment in development favouring the most vulnerable sectors. We also welcome the fact that the SDGs confirm the validity of strategic initiatives that we have been implementing in recent years, at the level of infrastructure and economic diversification and in the improvement of the business climate and the promotion of young people\u2019s and women\u2019s entrepreneurship. Actions are under way to begin the adoption process by the end of the year of the implementation of our national sustainable development plan, which seamlessly integrates the SDGs and will follow on our accelerated growth strategy and the promotion of employment for the 2013-2017 period.\n\u201cRecognizing that accountability for the results and mutual learning processes among countries are determinants for speeding up our progress towards the achievement of the SDGs, Togo will participate in the voluntary review to take place at the next high-level political segment on the implementation of the SDGs. We therefore take this opportunity before the Assembly to thank all entities of the United Nations system that have helped us in this exercise.\n\u201cIt is our conviction that the SDGs should make it possible to transform the world by giving priority to the most vulnerable groups \u2014 women, young people and children, populations threatened by conflicts and disasters, migrants and refugees. The need to look out for the fortunes of our peoples who had been left behind will assume a whole new dimension as we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development. Making development for the most vulnerable a priority is becoming increasingly crucial in the current context, which is marked by multiple and pressing challenges of persistent poverty and unemployment and threats to human security linked to climate change, disease, conflict and terrorism.\n\u201cOn actions for the protection of the environment, Togo is facing major climate challenges, such as coastal erosion, flooding, desertification and unpredictable rainy seasons. I take this opportunity at the Assembly to renew our firm commitment to the Paris Agreement. My country signed the Agreement and will do everything it can to aid in concluding the ratification process by the end of 2016. We are also doing everything possible to implement it. We welcome the ratification of the Agreement, which is so important for the future and survival of our planet.\n\u201cThe era we live in is also marked by a resurgence of new health challenges that compromise the progress we have realized in human and economic terms. Since we are aware of that reality, in my position as a coordinator of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in West Africa, I would like to thank all partners and organizations that made it possible for us to contain and even eliminate this epidemic.\n\u201cContinuing in the area of health, I would like to pay tribute to all the organizations and Member States that contributed to reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Despite the progress, we must not lower our guard because new health threats are on the horizon \u2014 diseases that in the past were under control but might resurge. We need to reinforce our health systems and policies in order to eradicate diseases, such as HIV/AIDS,\nbetter fight maternal and infant mortality and protect our world against antimicrobial resistance.\n\u201cNo development programme will be able to succeed and be sustainable if the national context in which it is to be implemented is not imbued with peace and cohesion. That is why my Government has deployed so many efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger, which are considered to be the root causes of insecurity and terrorism. Furthermore, we are working towards strengthening democracy and the rule of law by implementing political and institutional reforms that are consistent with the realities in our countries. In that regard, the recently created the Togolese High Commission for Reconciliation and Strengthening National Unity organized a workshop in July to reflect on and exchange views among all components of the Togolese nation with regard to establishing the bases for reforms that have not yet taken effect.\n\u201cWe are also working to step up democracy at the local level in order to provide a better chance for the success of our development strategy to reduce regional disparity. In order to do that, an accelerated plan of action and decentralization is also being implemented and should lead in the near future to local elections.\n\u201cIn the area of the protection and promotion of human rights, we are determined to strengthen our achievements in order to better guarantee fundamental freedoms. We also plan to make better use of our term in the Human Rights Council for the 2016-2018 period. In that regard, my country, which has undertaken a number of reforms in accordance with the recommendations resulting from the first cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, is preparing for the second cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, which will take place from 31 October to 11 November.\n\u201cThe noble objectives that our countries have set for themselves, in particular in the areas of sustainable development and the protection of the climate for future generations, cannot be achieved unless peace and security are guaranteed throughout the world. In that regard, despite the efforts that have been made under the auspices of our Organization and regional institutions, peace and security continue to be threatened or put at risk in certain regions. In Africa, Togo very much hopes that the efforts made by the United Nations and regional African organizations will help to bring peace to South Sudan and Libya, to cite but two countries. In that regard, Togo welcomes the fruitful discussions that took place in the African Union Peace and Security Council several days ago regarding South Sudan\u2019s future, and calls upon the parties involved to spare no effort in strengthening the country\u2019s foundations. Elsewhere in the world, my country calls upon all parties involved in the Syrian conflict to work in good faith to ensure that the Syrian people, crippled by a long conflict that has destabilized the whole region, can once again find peace, security and stability.\n\u201cAs we all know, the Syrian and the Libyan crises in particular are fuelling the scourge of terrorism, from which no region in the world is currently spared. I would like to once again remember the countless victims of terrorism and to express Togo\u2019s solidarity with the countries and populations that have recently fallen victim to the scourge. An effective counter-terrorism strategy requires States to continue working together by further strengthening the cooperation among their relevant technical units. The wealthiest countries must also agree to support more than they do already States like Togo that do not have the necessary resources to effectively fight terrorism.\n\u201cIn the light of the increasing risks and threats in our world today, our top priority must be to equip ourselves with the means to effectively and swiftly address the varying challenges that are affecting the well-being of our populations and limiting our economic development. Security threats are a huge risk for our agenda of transforming the world and require us to intensify our efforts to promote international peace and security. To meet that requirement, my country will host the African Union Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government on Maritime Security and Safety and Development in Africa from 10 to 15 October. The Summit\u2019s aim is to agree on a joint declaration that can better prevent and address maritime insecurity and promote sustainable and inclusive development of the blue economy in line with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. I wish to once again take this opportunity to extend an invitation to Member States to take part in the high-level Summit, which will involve all stakeholders from my country.\n\u201cSeventy years after its creation, the United Nations has greatly contributed to progress in the world by promoting peace, sustainable development and human rights. It has been able to bring about such change by reforming some of its own organs in order to take into account the world\u2019s shifting circumstances, which Togo welcomes. However, our Organization, which continues to work towards the rooting of democracy in its Member States, has found it difficult to reform the Security Council. Its current composition does not reflect real development in the world. My country believes that it is high time for Member States, and particularly for the five permanent members of the Council, to resolve to undertake a reform of the organ, which is the only way to avoid the frequent deadlock that prevents the Council from taking action and rapidly solving crises and conflicts. At a time when the international community is resolutely committed to pursuing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for the benefit of all, any further delay in the process of reforming the Security Council can only be harmful to the fulfilment of the SDGs.\n\u201cAddressing all of those challenges calls for effective and inclusive mobilization with the means to bring about the necessary changes for a better world. More specifically, a transformation of the African economy is key to eliminating poverty and hunger, providing young people with a future and curbing economic migrants. Such transformation is also the best protection against terrorism and the world\u2019s growing insecurity and is essential in giving fresh impetus to growth and in reducing pressure on the environment. Transforming the African economy will help to solve the world\u2019s challenges, but we must stay in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and be mobilized for subsequent investments through various mechanisms, in accordance with Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\n\u201cOur collective ambition is the well-being of everyone, which means that no one should be left behind. In that regard, efforts need to be undertaken that favour Africa, which is home to the greatest number of poor countries, in order to ensure its inclusion in the world economy. Moreover, the African continent remains an important lever for transforming the world in the SDG era, as it offers huge potential for a profound transformation of\nour world, with a youth population full of vitality, dynamic demographic growth, a wealth of natural resources, ingenuity and resilient men and women. In order to benefit from Africa\u2019s potential, we must remove the obstacles that impede its social and economic development as soon as possible, in order to reap the positive benefits at a global level, including in the areas of climate, peace, security, health and the right to development.\n\u201cIn the hope of an innovative United Nations partnership that can transform the world, starting with Africa, I welcome the commitment shown by the international community in its adoption of the SDGs. I remain convinced that the current session of the General Assembly will allow us to capitalize on the commitment to strengthen our collective working capacity between now and 2030, so as to bring about a world that is more secure, prosperous and equal, and which demonstrates solidarity and respects human rights, in response to the deep- seated aspirations of our peoples.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that we participate in this session of the General Assembly under the wise presidency of Mr. Peter Thomson, at a time when we are facing great challenges and witnessing humankind\u2019s legitimate desires and aspirations for a world of greater justice and solidarity. We are particularly proud and pleased to see a representative from a small island developing State conducting the work of the Assembly. We wish him every success during his term in office and assure him of the full cooperation and readiness of the delegation of Cabo Verde.\nWe also express our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his excellent work and congratulate him on his tireless efforts and dedication, as well as the transparent and inclusive manner in which he conducted the process of hearing candidates for the position of Secretary-General. We are certain that, under his guidance, the steps taken in the process of reform that is under way in the Organization were important ones.\nOn behalf of the Government of Cabo Verde, we would also like to applaud and thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as we approach the end of his two terms in office. We are grateful for his work and efforts aimed at building international peace and security, seeking relationships based on greater solidarity, brotherhood and fairness, combating poverty and pursuing balanced and sustainable development for all. As a small island developing State, Cabo Verde greatly appreciated his dedication to building a better world, in particular his contribution in successfully organizing and holding the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, held in Samoa, and for bringing about the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sutainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. With regard to the Paris Agreement, Cabo Verde is pleased with the number of States that have ratified it since April.\nAs a small island State, Cabo Verde bases its foreign policy on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and is certain that multilateralism is the most appropriate way to approach issues on the international agenda. Cabo Verde advocates for, and gives priority to, the consensus to keep pursuing international peace and security, promoting and fostering dialogue in conflict resolution and defending international law as indispensable elements for the advancement of humankind.\nWe note with concern that armed conflicts are proliferating in general, but more particularly in Africa and the Middle East. We have seen the resurgence of instability in several areas of the world, the unprecedented humanitarian crisis leading to the high number of refugees, irregular migrations, massive violations of human rights, poverty and lack of social cohesion, the widening of the inequality between rich and poorer nations, increasing acts of terrorism and atrocities and the growth of transnational crime, in particular drug trafficking. All of those phenomena, which we have been closely observing and cannot ignore, call for and compel us to act collectively.\nThe conflicts and sources of tension that persist on the African continent continue to be a concern for us, particularly the situations in Libya, South Sudan, Somalia and Mali. Cabo Verde supports the African Union in the search for solutions to those problems affecting the peace and security of our sister nations. Also with respect to our continent, we welcome Morocco\u2019s recent decision to rejoin the African Union. We hope that the reasons that compelled its withdrawal will be resolved in the framework of strengthened regional cooperation among the members of the Arab Maghreb Union, thereby contributing to stability and security in the Sahel region.\nWith respect to the Middle East, Cabo Verde understands the urgency of finding solutions to existing conflicts and encourages the pursuit of negotiations as the sole means to that end. We wish to specifically refer to the need to resume negotiations leading to a lasting peace that would allow both States \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 to live side by side in peace and security. In addition, we encourage the continuation of efforts to seek a negotiated solution in Syria that would put an end to the conflict and the suffering of the Syrian people.\nTerrorism is a phenomenon that affects all countries and all regions of the planet either directly or indirectly, and no one can remain indifferent to the immense suffering and violence it brings to entire populations. As a global problem, it is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and it therefore requires a global response. No country \u2014 large or small, rich or poor \u2014 is in a position to fight it alone or effectively.\nCabo Verde condemns, without reservations, acts of terrorism in any form or manifestation. We reaffirm our willingness and readiness to cooperate with other States, as well as with the United Nations system, to implement recommendations aimed at preventing and combating this threat. Accordingly, Cabo Verde welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, launched in January, as well as the results of the fifth review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nTaking into account the iniquities and inequalities that exist everywhere in some form, it is the understanding of my Government that such a scenario compels us to join forces in our efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Optional Protocols thereto constitute the basis for building more peaceful, just and inclusive societies, with fundamental rights and freedoms at the core of their development. In addition, we consider the role of institutions advocating in favour of human rights and civil society to be indispensable in promoting the rights inherent to human beings.\nAs was highlighted in the high-level thematic debate on human rights last July, under the theme \u201cHuman rights at the centre of the global agenda\u201d, the challenges associated with climate change, terrorism, violent extremism, conflicts and humanitarian crises require not only coordinated actions on all levels, but also the continuous fostering of good governance and the rule of law.\nMassive violations of those rights and the denial of civil, political, social and cultural rights hinder the full achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly the protection of and the enjoyment of rights by the most vulnerable populations. We are also convinced that the right to development constitutes a basic principle for social cohesion and the reduction of social inequalities within and among nations. As we celebrate the thirty-first anniversary of the Vienna Declaration on the Right to Development, it is important that the principles established therein be observed and fulfilled. With respect to protecting the most vulnerable, Cabo Verde welcomes the Political Declaration adopted at the high-level meeting on HIV/ AIDS (resolution 70/266) in June, which advocates for access to treatment, particularly for the most vulnerable, based on the principle of non-discrimination and non-stigmatization.\nCabo Verde recognizes and is concerned with the humanitarian crisis resulting from the large number of refugees and migrants and welcomes the organization and adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex) during the high-level meeting on migrants and refugees on 19 September. We believe that a significant part of the current difficulties may be overcome through the effective implementation of the planned global compacts on responsibility-sharing for refugees and on safe, regular and orderly migration, which are expected to be adopted next year. Furthermore, we call for the correct implementation of the international conventions related to that issue and stress the need to fight against the root causes of such phenomena.\nThe theme chosen for this General Assembly session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, could not have been more appropriate. The choice was judicious and pertinent. It was judicious because a significant portion of the work and attention of the United Nations upto 2030 will indeed focus on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and it was pertinent because, one year after the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda, we have the opportunity to express our points of view on how we intend to achieve the Goals that we established and overcome the challenges that persist and that could jeopardize the global commitment to leave no one behind.\nFor us, the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development implies enhancing the means of implementation, particularly financing, technology transfer, capacity-building and participation in international trade. Furthermore, we will need to develop the capacity to implement and follow up on a system to monitor national and regional policies, of which the United Nations system must be aware.\nThe devastating consequences of natural disasters resulting from climate change, which have a significant impact on the poorest and most vulnerable countries, remind us of the urgency of implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the importance of implementing the recommendations of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. Developing a low-carbon economy and creating resiliency and capacity to adapt are no longer just an option for many. They have become essential requirements to build a sustainable economy, particularly in island and archipelago countries, whose survival is being threatened by climate change.\nDespite the challenges inherent in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, its ambitious nature offers a unique opportunity to promote international solidarity and cooperation at an unprecedented level in the history of humankind. It is therefore against that backdrop that the United Nations system will be called upon to work as a unified front, avoiding duplication, increasing the monitoring and application of capacity at the national and regional levels, identifying emerging challenges, offering solutions that are not one-size-fits- all, and respecting the idiosyncrasies and specific contexts of each country.\nI cannot conclude without noting that Cabo Verde, as a small island State, is striving for the development of a sustainable and dynamic economy with a robust private sector and strengthened regulatory institutions. In order to build a resilient economy that is in line with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the Government that I am honoured to be a part of plans to develop strategic partnerships so as to reduce risks and minimize weaknesses. However, the challenge facing a small and vulnerable country such as Cabo Verde goes beyond our national capacity to mobilize technical and financial resources and calls for more coordinated and predictable support from the international community in general and the United Nations system in particular.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\nThe theme for this session is \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. This is a good topic. It adds another nail in the coffin of the old parasitic arrangement where only a small portion of humankind \u2014 those living in the United States of America, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 lived in affluence while the rest of the world lived in abject poverty.\nThe reasoning then was that one could not be affluent without doing so at the expense of somebody else. This logic has now been challenged. Between 1981 and 2010, 380 million and 270 million people in China and India, respectively, came out of poverty. Even in Africa, a continent with a lot of accumulated disadvantages, 414 million people have come out of poverty. In Uganda\u2019s case, in 2004 56 per cent of its people were living in poverty. Today that figure is 19 per cent. It is hoped that by 2017, it will be reduced to 10 per cent.\nIs the world not a better place with the spread of affluence? Have not the old affluent societies and the new ones both benefited? The United States is today exporting goods and services to China worth $120 billion per year. The European Union is exporting goods and services to China worth $356 billion. Has not the spread of affluence benefited more people?\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) understood this very well. There are 17 of them, and they are: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, to end hunger, to ensure healthy lives, to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, to achieve gender equality and so forth. I do not have to read out all 17 SDGs because representatives know them.\nAll this is a different way of providing a prescription for the problems of underdevelopment. We are happy at last. The global agenda includes most of the ingredients necessary for growth and the transformation of societies, as happened in the past for those societies that pioneered the Industrial Revolution. In particular, the inclusion of energy on the list of SDGs is a departure from past global agendas.\nThese SDGs fluctuate with many of our own 10 strategic bottlenecks. These are ideological disorientation; a weak State, especially the army, which needed restructuring; the suppression of the private sector; the underdevelopment of human resources, that is, a lack of education and health; the underdevelopment of infrastructure, that is, the railways, roads, electricity, telephones and piped water and so forth; a small internal market; the lack of industrialization; the underdevelopment of the services sector; the underdevelopment of agriculture and the attack on democracy.\nAs the Assembly can see, there are two crucial bottlenecks that are missing in the SDGs. These are ideological disorientation, which for us is bottleneck number one, and market integration, which is bottleneck number six. One can of course say that the idea of ideological disorientation is subsumed in SDG 16 \u2014 that of peace, justice and strong institutions. Nevertheless, there is no harm in singling out and highlighting this problem of the pseudo-ideology that exploits the identities of people \u2014 of religion, tribe, race, gender and so forth \u2014 and eclipses the interests of the people, such as balanced trade. That equal relationship between the producer of a good and the producer of a service and the buyer of the same, both in ancient and modern times, is the greatest stimulus for global prosperity.\nThis, however, is many times eclipsed by the shallow promotion of the chauvinism of religion, tribe, race or gender, even when one\u2019s religion mates, tribe mates and race mates are doing nothing or little for one\u2019s prosperity. Yet the recent growth through trade of China, India and so forth in their interaction with the United States of America, the European Union, Africa and so forth shows the power of the stimulus. Let the global body therefore understand and blacklist the pseudo-ideology of the sectarianism and chauvinism of groups. All the past mistakes and the present ones are linked to this problem. Imperialism, the slave trade, colonialism, neocolonialism, the ongoing sectarian conflicts in many parts of the world \u2014 all, in one way or another, spring from this pseudo-ideology. The fair and authentic ideology of being my brother\u2019s keeper, as it says in the Book of Genesis \u2014 chapter 4, verse 9 \u2014 is the true antidote to this poison. Abandon all forms of chauvinism and the world will be safer for everybody. In my dialect we say, \u201cThe one who shoots arrows at others should expect arrows to come his way\u201d.\nFinally, our sixth bottleneck \u2014 the bottleneck of fragmented markets in Africa and possibly in other places \u2014 should also be addressed. It has eased its trade with China, with India, with the United States, with Russia, with Brazil and Indonesia, because they are markets of $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, $150 million, $200 million and $200 million, respectively, because they are societies under one political authority each.\nWe and the others that have fragmented markets must struggle to rectify this deficiency.\nIn Africa, we are already moving forward. Hence, our East African Community, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of West African States and, ultimately, the common m+arket of the whole of Africa, as we agreed recently, in Kigali. These markets are taking us in the right direction. Remember that when I buy what is produced by your factories, I am supporting your prosperity; and when you buy what I produce, you are supporting my prosperity. Long live the SDGs. But, please, do not forget to add the bottlenecks that we observed here.\n"

        "file_text": "It is special pleasure to speak to the General Assembly under the presidency of a Pacific island friend.\nThe world is facing serious challenges. Borders are closing to people and products, and to investment and ideas. Many States are turning inwards. The politics of fear and extremism are gaining ground. Too many States are flouting the rules. But no country can face today\u2019s challenges alone. Now more than ever, we need to show that we are united in our respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. They are the basic principles that underpin our global system, born from the bitter experience of war, and they are as relevant today as they were in 1945.\nMy country, New Zealand, is a proudly independent, multicultural trading nation in the Asia-Pacific region. The international system matters to us. We are committed to being a good global citizen and to playing our part. We rise on the fortunes of all Member States. We believe that it is in all our interests to be open and outward-facing, to work through our differences, to have rules and, most of all, to play by them. Now is the time to reinforce the relevance and standing of the United Nations in our response to today\u2019s challenges.\nThere are many areas where the United Nations could be more efficient, more representative, more responsive and show greater leadership. It is our collective responsibility as Member States to face up to the political commitment necessary to make the United Nations the body that we want it to be.\nFor the past two years, our focus has been on the Security Council. We are using our term on the Council to raise the tough issues, because we believe that that is what the Council is for and what our supporters expect us to do. New Zealand is working for a Security Council that shows more leadership on the toughest political issues, that works harder to get the incentives right so as to broker solutions and that is better at responding to political crises before they spiral out of control.\nThe Council has put its weight behind many successes, from the adoption of the Iran deal to ending the long-running war in Colombia. But the Council also has shortcomings that, if not addressed, risk undermining its relevance and standing in world affairs. For the vast majority of Member States, which are dependent on a fair, rules-based international system, a weak Council is not an option. We acknowledge that the Council does not have a role in every crisis. But the reality is that we need the Council to respond when no one else can. That is why we have consistently called for Council action to revive the Middle East peace process.\nWe have also been deeply troubled to see the Council, the pre-eminent body for international peace and security, fail to live up to its responsibilities on the most serious crisis of our time \u2014 Syria. There the Council has fallen short. The internal politics within the Council and the sheer complexity of the Syrian crisis have obstructed a unified Council response. But we believe that no matter how difficult and sensitive the issues, the Council cannot watch the situation go from bad to worse for the Syrian people. The Security Council was established to address crises such as that which we see in Syria. That is why New Zealand is using our presidency of the Council to convene a leaders\u2019 level meeting tomorrow on Syria.\nA meeting by itself will not stop the conflict. But after more than five years of brutal fighting and horrific humanitarian suffering, we do not think that it is credible for leaders to come to New York and not address the stark realities driving the conflict. We hope that tomorrow\u2019s meeting will provide an opportunity for Council leaders to take stock of developments, examine the fundamental issues at the heart of the conflict and discuss how we can move towards a sustainable political solution.\nWe also hope that the meeting will be a chance for the Council to put its weight behind the ceasefire agreement reached between the United States and Russia. That agreement is the best chance we have had in some time to stop the fighting, get aid to those who need it and get back on track for a political resolution to the crisis.\nAnother critical issue on which New Zealand supports unified Council action is the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. New Zealand believes that a strong international response is required to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s nuclear test on 9 September and its recent missile tests. The regime\u2019s efforts to advance its nuclear and missile programmes, its callous disregard for the North Korean people, as demonstrated by the human rights situation in the country, and its leader\u2019s unpredictably ruthless rule have made it one of our most pressing international security threats. Its provocative actions show blatant disregard for Security Council resolutions and pose a grave threat to international law. They have raised tensions on the Korean peninsula to a point where the risk of conflict is dangerously high. We cannot afford further escalation.\nNew Zealand therefore welcomes recent steps by the United States and China to begin negotiating a new Security Council resolution, following the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s recent nuclear test. We hope that this will send a clear signal to the North Korean leadership that continued provocative and dangerous actions are unacceptable and that a return to the negotiating table represents the only sensible way forward. The international community must stand together in conveying these messages, including through fully implementing Security Council sanctions.\nThe Council has impact and influence when it is unified, but we have to get better at identifying incentives that encourage unified Council positions. For a country with a proud tradition of being a pragmatic bridge-builder and problem-solver, the Council can be an incredibly frustrating place to work. But we are committed to trying to make it work because it is in our collective interest to have a strong and relevant Council.\nWe all need to make an investment in keeping it on track where it is needed most: in preventing and stopping conflict. That means coming to the Council ready to find a way to get beyond vested political interests and being prepared to work on compromise solutions that stop the fighting.\nThe veto plays a huge part in the Council\u2019s effectiveness. No matter how hard we work to find compromises, time and time again we come up against the veto. The use of the veto, the threat of the veto, the exploitation of the veto is well beyond what the founders of the United Nations ever envisaged.\nWe acknowledge that addressing regional and national interests is a fundamental part of the process of finding durable solutions. But increasingly the Charter is being ignored and the Council seen as irrelevant as countries put pursuit of their national interests before almost anything else. The time for moving forward on Security Council reform is now. We will be pushing more than ever for action in the General Assembly to make the Council better reflect today\u2019s realities and needs.\nNew Zealand is also working to make the Council more effective in conflict prevention. We want to make the Council better at responding to political crises before they spiral out of control. There is no lack of mandate for conflict prevention. It is in the Charter. There is no lack of information about escalating situations. We see the evidence of this, often in the most heart- breaking images in the media. The problem is that we do not always have the will, and we do not use the tools available to us.\nMany States block action, asserting sovereignty and ignoring the rest of the Charter. Others do not want to spend the money. Most have bilateral or national interests. And leaders of countries in political crisis often do not want their actions to be on the Council\u2019s agenda.\nBut we cannot ignore the growing gap between the humanitarian costs of picking up the pieces after conflict and the amount that the United Nations allocates to prevent conflict. The shortfall is growing at an unsustainable rate, while the peace operations budget is increasing year on year.\nBut this is not about money. It is about saving lives. That is why New Zealand is trying to get the Council working more closely with regional organizations and getting the Council to be more willing to engage at an earlier point with countries in crisis. This is a focus of our presidency, and it will continue to be a focus of our work when we come off the Council.\nBeyond the Security Council, parts of the United Nations system are stepping up. There have been significant steps forward on development, climate, financing, humanitarian issues and disaster risk reduction. These issues are of significant importance to our closest development partners, small island developing States.\nFor economic development to be fully realized, the Sustainable Development Goals must be implemented by all. But developments here in the United Nations do not exist in a vacuum, apart from the global economy and trading system. Sustainable economic development is a key driver of global growth, prosperity and, most of all, stability. This requires a fair, rules-based trading system, more open trade and the removal of trade barriers.\nThe multilateral trading system has been a critical factor in this respect. Last year, we welcomed an agreement by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to eliminate agricultural export subsidies. This was the first legally binding international trade outcome in agriculture since 1994. This matters for development and will make a real difference for rural communities.\nBut the types of challenges that the United Nations faces are similar to those that have hindered more progress in the WTO in recent years. New Zealand believes that the WTO needs to do more to set global trade rules. We need it to find common ground that overcomes vested national interests and agree to new international trade commitments that benefit all countries.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, closer economic integration through trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will also bring us closer together. Agreements like these will make our region and people better off by setting the conditions for more open and transparent trade. A more prosperous and integrated region will also be a more secure one, and that is in all of our interests.\nWe must guard against creeping protectionism and be willing to make the case for more economic engagement clearly. We cannot turn inward. We cannot allow fear or narrow domestic interests to turn us away from an open global trading system that has lifted millions out of poverty. Countries that close their borders cannot and do not do business. History has shown that this does not work for our countries. It will not help our peoples, and protectionism will have a chilling effect on our ability to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.\nA decision of critical importance to the future of the United Nations will be made in the coming weeks. In April, I was very pleased to nominate former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark to be the first United Nations Secretary-General from the Pacific. This is not the time for a business-as-usual appointment of a Secretary-General. We need someone who is up to the job. The next Secretary-General must have the courage, experience and skills necessary to lead this Organisation, to keep it relevant and responsive. I have worked across the political divide from Helen Clark for years, and I know her to be a natural leader. She rallies people together to find common ground, even when the issues are difficult and the differences vast. She gets things done. We think it is time for a Secretary-General like Helen Clark.\nI am proud of the contribution that New Zealand is making to the Security Council, but I am keenly aware of the Council\u2019s limitations. It is the General Assembly that now needs to act to make the United Nations stronger and more relevant to the world. New Zealand is committed to the principles and values of the United Nations. We will keep working hard for those principles, because we believe that they are vital for a safer, more prosperous future.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate President Peter Thomson on having assumed the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to wish him every success. I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its previous session, for his efforts and contributions.\nThe current session of the General Assembly comes in the wake of our launching a new phase in our efforts to achieve comprehensive sustainable development, in its environmental, economic and social dimensions, following our adoption of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (resolution 69/313) on financing for development the previous year.\nThe aspirations of peoples, particularly in the developing world, to a decent standard of living and ongoing progress are without a doubt our primary responsibility as leaders, entrusted to us by our peoples, in line with the principles of humanity that guide us all. However, the challenges that face developing countries, coupled with their limited capacities, prevent the full realization of the Goals set out in the Agenda. Developing countries are not afforded sufficient opportunity to achieve sustainable development; they require a conducive international environment that provides them with a larger share of international trade, financing mechanisms and the transfer of technology, as well as investment flows and debt settlement. They must also have a national environment that is conducive to development.\nEgypt calls for support for the role of the State in order to ensure a balance between the different dimensions of sustainable development, particularly in relation to the effectiveness of social security networks and advancing national ownership of development. Egypt also stresses the importance of harnessing the global monetary system to establish a fair global economic system that provides equal opportunities for development and contributes to minimizing the gap between developed and developing countries. The United Nations is the ideal platform to address this issue. Accordingly, Egypt was among the first 22 States to present a voluntary review of its development plans last July.\nLast year we reached an agreement based on the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As Coordinator of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change, I reaffirm Africa\u2019s commitment to confronting climate change, within the limits of its capabilities, and its aspiration to put into practice the implementation mechanisms of the agreement on the transfer of technology and sustainable financing. Egypt has established a track for the Renewable Energy Initiative and presented it in the context of its leadership of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change, in implementation of the relevant African Union resolutions.\nEgypt wishes to highlight the importance of this initiative in providing support to Africa. Efforts to address climate change must take into consideration equity and the right to development, as well as adherence to the principles of international law, the most important of which is refraining from harm; enhancing cooperation; and the participation of different countries in prospective projects, in accordance with the rules that govern international financial institutions, particularly the World Bank.\nThe world has become a global village as a result of the positive impact of the communications technology revolution, as well as unimpeded capital flows, investments and global trade. However, we continue to see another facet of globalization, one that has led to a number of social and economic challenges.\nGlobalization has been linked to an increase in poverty, the expansion of the inequality gap and the undermining of the social contract. These factors combined have exerted pressure on the institutional cohesion of affected countries. These challenges and pressures constitute the greatest incentive for the international community to work diligently to provide State institutions in all countries with the best possible means of undertaking their responsibilities and meeting the needs and aspirations of their peoples.\nAmid the challenges facing the international order, the Egyptian people have succeeded in enforcing their will to achieve stability, to protect the State and its institutions and to safeguard their society from fragmentation and chaos. The Egyptian people approved a new Constitution that enshrines the rights and freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, establishes equality regardless of citizenship and consolidates protection of vulnerable groups, paving the way for women to occupy an unprecedented number of seats in the House of Representatives and expanding its youth representation. The House of Representatives is now actively exercising its legislative authority and oversight responsibilities over the executive authorities.\nOn the economic front, Egypt is steadily moving forward in implementing an ambitious plan for economic reform that takes into consideration social dimensions and the requisites of a decent livelihood for the Egyptian people. Egypt is also implementing major national projects with an aim of expanding its road network and renewable energy production, as well as increasing agricultural land.\nWhile the Middle East continues to suffer from bloody conflicts, Egypt has managed to preserve its stability in a highly unstable region, thanks to the solidity of its institutions and its people\u2019s awareness of their great cultural heritage. The international community must acknowledge and support that fact, to the benefit of the region and the whole world, so that Egypt may continue to act as an anchor of stability in the Middle East, sparing no efforts in carrying out its natural role by working with regional and international parties to restore security and stability in the Middle East.\nAt the forefront of the bloody conflicts plaguing the region, the agonizing situation in Syria has now reached its sixth year, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions more internally displaced people and refugees, both within their homeland and in neighbouring countries. Among them are 500,000 Syrians whom Egypt has welcomed as brothers and sisters, providing them with health care, education and housing. The bloodletting in Syria and the absence of any political prospects on the horizon are no longer acceptable.\nWhat is necessary is clear \u2014 an immediate and comprehensive halt to all hostilities throughout Syria, thereby paving the way for a political solution that ends the bloodshed and preserves the territorial integrity and security of Syria and its State institutions, as well as realizing the aspirations of Syrians and putting an end to the chaos that has served only to facilitate the proliferation of terrorism. In that regard, we welcome the latest agreement on cessation of hostilities, which was reached as a result of commendable efforts by Russia and the United States. We hope for swift and serious international action to resume negotiations as soon as possible, in order to reach a comprehensive settlement to the crisis.\nWithin the same context of our troubled region, the Arab-Israeli conflict continues to be the core of regional instability in the Middle East, necessitating joint efforts by the countries of the region and the international community to reach a final and comprehensive solution to the conflict. Egypt continues to pursue its best efforts to achieve peace in the region and end the Israeli occupation through negotiations and progress in the peace process in order to reach a final settlement as well as sustainable and just peace, on the basis of a two-State solution. We therefore welcome current efforts based on a genuine desire to improve the situation in Palestinian territories, as the Palestinian people continue to suffer from a state of affairs that must be rectified. There should be a focus on ending the occupation and restoring the rights of the Palestinian people through a peace agreement consistent with resolutions of international legitimacy \u2014 one that guarantees Palestinians\u2019 right to their own State and achieves security for Israel by normalizing relations in the region.\nEgypt reiterates that a hand for peace continues to be extended in the form of the Arab Peace Initiative. Egypt also stresses the need to work to take constructive steps to end Israeli settlement-building and to initiate negotiations for a lasting resolution, while simultaneously halting all acts that bring harm to the Arab heritage in Jerusalem.\nAllow me to deviate from my written statement \u2014 here at this forum, which represents the voice of the world \u2014 to address and appeal to Israeli leaders and the Israeli people to consider the need to find a solution to this question. We have a real opportunity to begin a new chapter in the history of our region and to move towards peace. Egypt\u2019s inspiring and unique experience can in fact be replicated by solving the Palestinian problem and establishing a Palestinian State alongside the Israeli State, while preserving peace, security and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians.\nLibya is currently at a dire juncture and in deep political crisis, which has direct implications for Egyptian national security. Despite the progress achieved last year through the signing at Skhirat of the Libyan Political Agreement, there have been difficulties in its implementation. Egypt is playing an active role in bringing the Libyan parties together and supporting the implementation of the Agreement as a means of regaining the unity of the Libyan State and its authority over its territory and allowing it to operate through its legitimate institutions, as represented by the Presidential Council, the National Unity Government, the House of Representatives and the national army.\nEgypt is also hosting meetings of our Libyan brothers to facilitate the implementation of the Skhirat Agreement, as well as the establishment of a national unity Government that represent all Libyans and its ratification by the House of Representatives, so that the country can focus on its reconstruction. That in turn would allow the Libyan army to focus on combating terrorism. In that regard, it is necessary to lift the arms embargo imposed on the army. There is no place for terrorism and militias in Libya. The time has come to restore the institutions of the Libyan State.\nIn Yemen, Egypt is exerting every effort to support Yemeni territorial integrity and security and the return of the legitimate Government. We support the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh, and his plan to resolve the crisis, which has been approved by the legitimate Government. We stress the importance of resuming negotiations and for all parties to declare their commitment to the Special Envoy\u2019s plan to reach a comprehensive settlement in Yemen in accordance with Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2216 (2015). Egypt will continue to support efforts towards a solution and to provide humanitarian assistance to our Yemeni brothers and sisters, in addition to our fundamental role in securing maritime navigation in Bab Al-Mandab and the Red Sea.\nThe majority of these Arab crises are a reflection of a global state of conflict, and I must reiterate Egypt\u2019s rejection of any foreign interference in Arab affairs. I would like to affirm our commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and to stress Egypt\u2019s solidarity with Arab States in facing foreign interventions, in the light of the link between Arab security, including the security of the Arab Gulf.\nBy the same token, Egypt shoulders its responsibility towards the security and stability of Africa. Egypt currently chairs the Peace and Security Council of the African Union. In that capacity, Egypt is focusing on enhancing cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations in terms of growing transnational threats, including terrorism and organized crime. We aim to bring about a shift in addressing conflicts, on the basis of the principle of national leadership and ownership, to ensure the success of peacebuilding efforts. Through its memberships in both the African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council, Egypt has been keen to enhance coordination between the two bodies \u2014 something Egypt placed at the forefront of its priorities during its chairmanship of the Council. Egypt has sought to support the Peace and Security Architecture in Africa, in particular by way of efforts to operationalize the African Standby Force. Egypt has also increased its participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions in the region, having regained its place as one of the ten largest contributors.\nEgypt calls for the adoption of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy through an approach that is not limited to security aspects but includes ideological considerations as well. Egypt will host the counter- terrorism centre for the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States.\nEgypt would also like to highlight the importance of assessing any rising sources of tension, taking into consideration the phenomena of desertification and water scarcity, and the developmental needs related to managing transnational boundaries in connection with water resources.\nWith regard to situations in the African continent, Egypt stresses the need to provide the Somali Government with support in order to conclude elections. In Burundi, Egypt seeks to find solutions to the political crisis through the African Union Peace and Security Council and through the United Nations Security Council. We are working to address the crisis in the appropriate manner so as to defuse the political situation and allow all the Burundian parties to intensify peaceful political dialogue, thereby averting the use of violence.\nEgypt has sought to participate in the regional framework to address the crisis in South Sudan ever since its inception, engaging with the parties to the conflict, as well as regional and international parties, to achieve peace. Through its current chairmanship of the African Peace and Security Council, Egypt is seeking to increase the role of the Council in that regard, as well as to enhance cooperation with the joint monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Egypt calls for all parties to work within the Transitional Government of National Unity of South Sudan, with the aim of restoring peace to Juba.\nRegarding the Republic of the Sudan. Egypt commends the efforts carried out by the Sudanese Government, which have resulted in the signing of the road map proposed by the African Union High-level Implementation Panel last April.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism and the animus towards the right to life it represents have become an urgent threat to international peace and security. Terrorism constitutes a threat to the entity of the State in favour of extremist ideologies that utilize religion as a veil from behind which to conduct monstrous acts and menace the destinies of peoples. Fighting it requires intensive regional and international cooperation. Egypt has always stressed that the effort to defeat terrorism will never achieve its end unless we address the root causes of the phenomenon, confront terrorist groups with decisiveness and refute the extremist ideologies that give birth to terrorism and its proponents.\nI call upon the international community to take all possible measures to prevent terrorism from exploiting advances in information technology, which have contributed to endowing the phenomena of terrorism and ideological extremism with dangerous new dimensions that have given them a global reach. It is essential to end the broadcasting of channels and the hosting of websites that incite violence and extremism.\nThe world is at a crossroads. Threats to international peace and security are no longer conventional but have rather evolved to constitute a threat to the very tenets of human civilization. In the same vein, the challenges that we face \u2014 be they humanitarian, environmental, economic, developmental or health-related \u2014 are no longer confined by international borders but have become global. In that regard, I would like to point out that the first preambular paragraph to the Constitution of UNESCO states that \u201csince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed\u201d.\nI assert before the Assembly that terrorism is the cancer of our age, spreading with it the call for extremism and violence in the minds of people. Accordingly, it is our duty to instil in those very same minds the principles of tolerance and coexistence. If culture is the reflection of the principles by which humankind lives, then we must employ culture, technology and knowledge for the benefit of the development of peace.\nThe United Nations has to give greater attention to addressing the cultural aspects of development and peacemaking and to eliminating destructive ideologies, including through access to knowledge, transfer of technology and confronting extremist ideologies. That must be undertaken in partnership with UNESCO, an organization whose role has grown vastly in importance in today\u2019s world. Egypt recognizes the ever-increasing importance of that role and the importance of taking the utmost advantage of the organization with a view to achieving a better, safer and more understanding world in which there is room for all.\nIt high time for humankind to reclaim the essence of its humanity, while sharing knowledge and technology without monopolizing them and uniting in the face of challenges. Just as it has always been an eternal accumulation of civilizations, Egypt reaffirms before the General Assembly today its commitment to continuing to contribute to coexistence within the international family and striving for a more secure and prosperous world for our future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "Many world leaders care more about retaining power than improving the lives of their people. Those words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were recently addressed to us, the people in this Hall. We who are joined here are incredibly privileged. Our job enables us to be in touch with the most successful and the most miserable. We can meet individuals with remarkable destinies and also the poor whose daily routine is to fight for a piece of bread or a bottle of clean water to stay alive. Each of them trusts that we will be able to understand the scope of their problems. They hope that we will never set our personal interests over the needs of our people, our countries and our planet.\nLast year\u2019s decision of the international community to transform the world for good \u2014 to leave no one behind \u2014 was a clear and ambitious way of how to address these needs. We are also perfectly aware of the nature of the challenges awaiting us to decarbonize the economy, to promote inclusive and sustainable development. But too many people tend to be pessimistic when it comes to setting grand global goals. Seemingly, there are more than enough reasons for their negativity, as we witness wars, terror and suffering. We see the damaging consequences some of our actions have on the planet and the people. And we can see them online, as new technologies bring us closer than ever to each other.\nIn the interconnected world of social networks, bad news travels especially fast. Sometimes it is accompanied by lies, propaganda and dangerous ideologies aimed at manipulating the public, spreading hate and frustration, and creating a fearful picture of the globalized world falling apart. Maybe that is one of the reasons why so many people are sceptical about the global development goals and our ability to deliver, and why we often forget that humankind has an impressive track record when it comes to making the world a better place. Global poverty has been halved in the past two decades. People fight fewer wars and commit fewer homicides. Many more men and women have access to health care and more girls attend schools than at any time in the past.\nI am sure that we are more than capable of dealing with such challenges as poverty, hunger, diseases, injustice and discrimination. With the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we have the best means in the history to make life on the planet as good as it gets. The success of the new Agenda will not be possible without efficient international cooperation and coordination, backed by United Nations institutions. Success will be not possible without us, the people in this Hall. At the same time, we should not forget about our very own homework \u2014 to win the hearts, minds and trust of our people.\nThe world has become smaller due to globalization and modern communication technologies. The problems our world faces have become more global and intertwined. Yet our social instincts have often remained local, and our sense of responsibility is often limited by our national borders. There is a real danger that many of us thought we would not see spreading again. It is the rise of nationalism, extremism, racism and intolerance in many parts of the world. I am certain that responsible leaders need to address those dark moods in our societies, because those moods are the ultimate enemy of humankind \u2014 the enemy responsible for the worst misery and bloodbath in our modern history.\nOne of our most obvious duties as political leaders is, without doubt, to provide for and preserve peace and development. We have established many useful institutions to progress in that effort. However, we are witnessing the largest crisis of displacement since the Second World War. There is no need for me to recall the worrying number of refugees. We hear those numbers so often that sometimes we forget that this is not a numbers game. As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, migrants and refugees are not pawns on the chessboard of humankind. They are children, fathers and mothers \u2014 real men and women.\nEvery political misunderstanding and failure to find solutions leads to more people without a roof over their head, more families separated and more hungry children. It means greater temptation to set people against each other and arouse fear among them. We may have different starting positions, different experiences and even different points of view on the problem, but we all have to understand that refugees need our empathy and our help. I strongly and truly believe that it is a moral duty of every successful, modern country to help. It is a moral duty of any true political leader to think seriously about how to help those fleeing violence and death. Let us be honest here and again ask ourselves the question raised by the Secretary-General. Are we all doing enough to improve the lives of people in need, or are we more concerned about retaining our power? Are we here to serve or to be served?\nOur commitment to a just and safe world is tested as we mourn with the families of the victims of terrorism, and as we struggle to wrap our minds around that source of human suffering. When a terrorist group enslaves, murders and takes hope from men, women and children, it is not a single nation\u2019s problem. It is an attack on our very core \u2014 on our humanity. It is an attempt to kill goodness in us. Terrorists do not care about dozens or hundreds of innocent victims. They target hundreds of millions of the hearts and minds of spectators around the world to cause them to fear and to hate, encourage hostility among nations and fulfil their sick vision of the clash of civilizations.\nWe need to stay strong in our societies and true to our core values and culture of mutual respect, peace and non-violence. We can see that it is not hard to make people fear. Sadly, it is not hard to make people hate. But we must not respond by judging people by the colour of their skin or their choice of worship. We need to halt the growing anger, prejudice and hostility towards different religions. True leadership brings hope, reinforces trust and offers sustainable solutions for safety and peaceful coexistence.\nIn the words of a well-known catchphrase, we should think globally and act locally. The crisis in Ukraine \u2014 in the part of the world where I come from \u2014 has entered its third year. Slovakia is very concerned about the destabilization of a neighbouring country and repeated violence in the region. I would like once again to firmly call for tangible progress in reaching a settlement of the conflict. I believe the Minsk agreements remain the only viable way out of the crisis. Slovakia is ready to continue to assist Ukraine in securing a stable, prosperous and democratic future for all of its citizens.\nNot long from now, the General Assembly will appoint a new Secretary-General of the United Nations. This year, the process of selecting the next Secretary- General has been more consultative, transparent and open than ever before. My country has the extraordinary privilege of being part of the process as we have fielded our own candidate. I wish to take this opportunity to express my gratitude and appreciation for the Member States\u2019 continued support as we approach the final stages of the selection process. Their support also proves that candidates from our region have a lot to offer in terms of potential, capabilities, knowledge and accomplishments.\nWe are still living in strange, contradictory times. We can upload our personal medical data for an examination by a physician on the opposite side of the globe, and yet 16,000 children die every day, mostly from preventable or treatable causes. We are using autonomous, self-driving cars, but millions of kids still cannot find their way into a classroom. Our phones, powered by artificial intelligence, are speaking to us, but one in 10 people on this planet does not have access to drinkable water.\nWith all our resources, all our innovative power and all our unprecedented ways of knowledge-sharing, we cannot ignore the opportunities that exist to increase global prosperity, freedom and the dignity of human beings. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has been crafted on the basis of our successes and our experience. It is our task to drive the necessary change to make the world a more prosperous, healthy, inclusive and safe place. It is our task to share the wealth of our planet.\nYes, times are uncertain, but I do believe that we can succeed. As one of the Slovak priests who spent years in prison during the totalitarian period of my country\u2019s history once said, \u201cI do not know what the future will bring, but I know now how I will act.\u201d He could say this because he was always guided by his values.\nWe can succeed too when we let our values guide us through difficult times \u2014 our values of humanity, solidarity and empathy \u2014 and when we, the political leaders with the privilege and power of agenda-setting, will not give up the battle for the hearts and minds of our people to remain open to humanity, solidarity and hope, only then can our world prosper. Only then will we truly leave no one behind.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring greetings from the people of Nicaragua and from our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra. We are very pleased to see a brother from Fiji, a Pacific island State, preside over the General Assembly for the very first time. He can count on Nicaragua\u2019s support.\nA year ago, the international community agreed to launch the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which offers us a historic opportunity to transform our planet and fight for a just world order so that together, in peace, solidarity and complementarity, we may advocate for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nEndemic poverty and inequality have become more noticeable than ever in developing and developed countries alike, especially in vulnerable and marginalized groups, including peoples living under colonial occupation and foreign intervention. It is urgent that we eradicate colonialism and end military interventions and aggressions in order to fully realize the right of our peoples to self-determination and development.\nThe right to development is a right of all. The international community has yet to answer for the millions of human beings to whom that right remains a dream. Developed countries must comply once and for all with their commitments regarding official development assistance by providing additional, predictable and sufficient financial resources. Nicaragua recognizes the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to social justice based on respect for human rights, including the right to development.\nMuch has been said in recent days about climate change. The World Meteorological Organization projects that 2016 is heading towards breaking all temperature records since records have been kept, which makes it clear that the agreements reached at the twenty-first session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris failed to establish a firm starting point to address the greatest challenge facing the planet. The voluntary, non-binding formula will lead to an increase in global temperature of 3\u00b0C or more, which will have catastrophic effects on highly vulnerable countries.\nMany of us feel that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient ,and we urge more ambitious actions. We note with great concern the worldwide record temperatures and little ambition to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, which corroborates Nicaragua position\u2019s at COP21. Nicaragua, adhering to international law and taking into account the principle of damage recovery, has demanded a global compensation policy in order to address that phenomenon.\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate our support for the just aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan for greater participation in United Nations specialized agencies, in accordance with the demands and needs of that brotherly nation of 23 million inhabitants, which should not be excluded from the Organization.\nWe in Latin America and the Caribbean have reiterated our desire to assert ourselves as a zone of peace and fair development in order to achieve firm and lasting peace and social justice through dialogue and understanding. We are pleased at and welcome the restoration of relations between Cuba and the United States of America. However, it is disappointing to note the intensification of measures that maintain the cruel, inhuman and criminal economic, financial and commercial blockade against Cuba.\nWe reiterate our congratulations to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on having recently assumed the leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement. In that vein, we offer our full support to President Nicolas Maduro Moros and his legitimate Government, which continues to be the victim of aggression, assault and destabilizing policies from the exterior, coordinated with anti-democratic and oligarchic sectors from the past.\nWe once again hail the signing of the peace agreements in Colombia between the Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, and offer our best wishes for the peace agreements to prevail and be implemented.\nPuerto Rico is Latin American and Caribbean. We demand that the colonial Power resolve this situation through dialogue and negotiation. We call on the United States of America to release the Puerto Rican patriot Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera as a humanitarian gesture.\nWe express our solidarity and support for the legitimate rights of the Argentine Republic in the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands, South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. The United Kingdom must immediately comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions and resume direct negotiations with Argentina.\nWe reiterate our solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We demand the immediate return of all Arab and Palestinian territories currently occupied by Israel.\nWe welcome and resolve to maintain our solidarity with the people of Western Sahara in their fight under the leadership of the Polisario Front.\nWe reiterate our full solidarity with the Government and people of Syria in their fight against international terrorism in defence of their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We stress the need for a political solution negotiated among Syrians and an end to foreign intervention, including the funding and delivery of weapons to terrorist groups. It has pained us to witness the proliferation of terrorist attacks against peoples and Governments. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nNicaragua will always promote its policy of peace, unity and understanding among nations, for political and negotiated solutions to conflicts and for the right of our peoples to achieve sustainable development and well- being. As current holder of the presidency pro tempore of the Central American Integration System, we are reinforcing our integration in all fields and working together to combat the scourge of drug trafficking and organized crime. Together with El Salvador and Honduras, we are striving to make the Gulf of Fonseca a zone of peace and development.\nWe highlight the need to eradicate threats to civic security and social order in our region with a strong and coordinated strategy against organized crime and its ramifications. In Nicaragua, our policies are focused on the human individual and the Nicaraguan family. Our people are ratifying their confidence in our socialist Christian model of solidarity, which ensures that our lives continue to improve in a safe and stable manner, in growth and in peace with our people as principal actors. Through good governance, we have prioritized economic growth, job growth, the reduction of poverty and inequality, the strengthening of gender equality and macroeconomic stability in sovereignity and security in harmony with the Earth.\nNicaragua has been recognized by the World Economic Forum as one of the most successful countries in terms of gender equality and as the safest country in Central America and one of the safest in Latin America. As one of the three safest countries for investment, we have sustained economic growth of approximately 5 per cent of our gross domestic product in the past five years. We have achieved this success through a model of partnership, dialogue and consensus under the leadership of our Government, working with the private sector and the workers themselves.\nWe reject the proposals and initiatives put forth by the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States, as they constitute violations of international law and a breach of the Charter of the United Nations. Those legislative bodies have been involved in interventionist policy throughout history and interfered in our own sovereign political, economic and social processes. This interference is notably more intense in the election season.\nWe in Nicaragua shall continue to strengthen peace, stability, governability and progress through such unprecedented proposals as our model of partnership, dialogue and consensus, which enjoys constitutional status and has helped us to mobilize the economy and achieve important progress in the fight against poverty. The National Reconciliation and Unity Government reiterates its firm commitment to this model, which unites us around the common good and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to peace, security, tranquility and democracy. In the weeks prior to our general elections, our people have demonstrated their support with high approval ratings and willingness to participate in the elections of 6 November with confidence and hope.\nNicaragua will continue to fight for a better world of values, where human beings strive for a sustainable, just, equitative, safe and sovereign development; and where the advances of science and technology, reflected in all areas of our lives, are accessible and shared by all. We will be able to make our world a better one only once we ourselves assume, along with family and society, a steadfast commitment to peace and equality among nations and their respective societies.\nI conclude by declaring my hope that peace may prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Papua New Guinea appreciates and applauds the outgoing President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mogens Lykketoft, for his outstanding guidance of the General Assembly in the conduct of its business this past year.\nPapua New Guinea is delighted to see a Pacific Islander presiding for the first time over the General Assembly at this session as its seventy-first President, and joins the international community in congratulating His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson on his historic election. We wish him a successful presidency.\nWe gather here before the sombre backdrop of a world that is beset with multidimensional humanitarian, political, economic, social, peace and security and environmental challenges on a scale that is unprecedented in recent memory. Many of our countries, including my own, have not been spared from the adverse impact of the global situation, and we continue to reel from them. Those challenges are unlikely to be overcome in the short term or by individual countries on their own. That reminds us all of the importance of ensuring that we, the peoples of the United Nations, renew and strengthen our resolve and faith in the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe ongoing sad plight of millions of refugees and migrants \u2014 including internally displaced persons and those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives \u2014 should not and cannot become the new normal. No country is immune from the implications of that increasing global concern. My Government in Papua New Guinea \u2014 in accordance with our international human rights obligations and in close partnership with Australia \u2014 hosts, on a humanitarian basis, a regional processing centre on the island of Manus for asylum-seekers who have made perilous journeys from troubled areas of the world, including the Middle East and Asia. That bilateral arrangement has not been without its controversies. My Government has accepted the decision of our Supreme Court earlier this year to close down the facility, as the arrangement was found to be unconstitutional. My Government is now in the process of dismantling that facility and looking at other arrangements with Australia to resettle those refugees who do not wish to settle in Papua New Guinea.\nWe are committed to being part of the global solution to the affront to the dignity of humanity and human rights imposed by forced migration. We pledge to act together with the international community to address not only the root causes of that issue, but also to better assist the affected victims and impacted countries of origin, transit and destination. The desire to halt the inhumanity and indignity must be our moral compass. We therefore commend and support the strong leadership shown by the Secretary-General and other leaders of the world in directly addressing that serious issue, particularly through the World Humanitarian Summit and other relevant meetings on migrants and refugees.\nIn the context of human rights protection and promotion, Papua New Guinea welcomes this morning\u2019s adoption by the Human Rights Council of the set of recommendations for Papua New Guinea\u2019s second universal periodic review. As challenging as they are, my Government is committed to addressing the various issues raised in that report (A/HRC/33/10).\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s Constitution sets the protection and promotion of human rights as an enduring and sacrosanct principle, to which we remain steadfastly committed. That encompasses all the rights and freedoms articulated in the Charter of the United Nations and particularly the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other human rights treaty obligations under international law.\nAs Papua New Guinea embarks on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other multilateral agreements, we are guided by our National Strategy for Responsible Sustainable Development, our Medium-Term Development Plan and the long-term strategic Vision 2050 development road map as we work towards becoming a prosperous, secure, healthy, peaceful and progressive nation. The importance of ensuring the fundamental and inherent rights of our citizens continues to remain central to that process.\nFor Papua New Guinea, the key to realizing the enhancement of our citizens\u2019 human rights and freedoms while ensuring our fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals also hinges on fostering the right enabling environment. That includes the rule of law, good governance, capacity-building, economic growth, multi-stakeholder partnerships and national ownership and leadership. Papua New Guinea\u2019s concern for human rights is also demonstrated by our long and proactive membership in the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization, which addresses the aspirations for self-determination of colonized peoples and territories. That process must be completed, and our commitment remains undiminished.\nPapua New Guinea is concerned that the international community, despite all its efforts, is unable to contain the ongoing wars caused by economic, religious, ethnic and other factors, including acts of terrorism. My Government is hopeful that the high- level meetings conducted over this past year will help address many of the root causes of those conflicts.\nMany of today\u2019s ongoing conflicts are also fuelled by the proliferation of firearms, especially small arms and light weapons. We therefore welcome global efforts to regulate the arms trade, which will minimize global conflicts and the displacement of people.\nThe United Nations Charter and the universal and transformative Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development are instructive on the nexus between peace, security and sustainable development for the benefit of humankind.\nLet us seize this opportunity to work hand in hand in order to resolve the simmering conflicts and tensions that continue tragically to afflict many parts of the world. Those events have dire consequences not only for those directly affected but also for the rest of the international community. Papua New Guinea joins the international community in calling on all adversaries in armed conflicts around the world to lay down their arms and resort to peaceful means for the settlement of conflicts.\nOn nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, Papua New Guinea is staunchly opposed to their existence, testing and use. Complete disarmament of those murderous weapons is what the world needs for peace and security. In that regard, Papua New Guinea is concerned over the ongoing nuclear weapons and missile tests carried out by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in contravention of the relevant Security Council resolutions. We strongly condemn such acts, as they threaten regional and global peace and stability.\nFor our part, my country is making a modest contribution through the United Nations peacekeeping operations in South Sudan and Darfur. We stand ready to work with the United Nations and further cooperate in international peacekeeping. We also learned hard but important lessons from our own internal armed conflict in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville two decades ago. We thank the United Nations and other partners for the valuable support provided in resolving that conflict. At the regional level, we continue to effectively support the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands as it transitions to its conclusion next June.\nThe year 2016 has been heralded as the year of the implementation of recently adopted international development agreements, in particular the transformative and inclusive 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which underscores the importance of eradicating poverty and ensuring that no one is left behind. It now forms the key driver for multilateral and bilateral cooperation, as well as national engagement, in improving the quality of life for all.\nWe therefore welcome and support the sensible theme for this General Assembly session chosen by the new President. The challenge is to ensure that the 2030 Agenda is led and driven nationally with support, as necessary, from development partners. To that end, we appreciate and have supported the first high-level review of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and are committed to ensuring their full implementation in our country and globally as well. Papua New Guinea agrees with the high-level political forum\u2019s outcome, which recognizes that the key to the 2030 Agenda hinges on ensuring national ownership and leadership, multi-stakeholder engagement and partnership, and a paradigm shift away from the business-as-usual modus operandi.\nMy Government is committed to delivering on the SDGs for the people of Papua New Guinea. We are building on the important lessons learned from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We are in the process of translating and integrating the SDGs at the national level within the framework of the National Strategy for Responsible Sustainable Development. That is further guided by our medium- term plan and our long-term Vision 2050 development plan for a prosperous nation.\nMy Government recognizes that the 2030 Agenda aligns fully with our current national development priorities with regard to education, health, infrastructure, sustainable economic growth, and law and order, which we are already implementing throughout the country. In that regard, my Government has legislated and is implementing a robust and unprecedented decentralized governance structure that now enables our 89 districts throughout the country to be fully funded and directly involved in identifying, designing and implementing the national development priorities specific to their respective areas. We are engaging the private sector, faith-based organizations and civil-society organizations, which are adding value to our national development.\nWe also stress the importance of mobilizing resources, including financial support from all available sources, so as to be able to deliver on the SDGs nationally. That is why the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on funding for development is pivotal and needs to be fully implemented. At our national level, we have recently concluded taxation-system reforms so as to strengthen financial resource mobilization in support of our national development agenda.\nThe attainment of the SDGs at the national level is also dependent on the growth and strength of the global economy. The ongoing depressed global economy, with low agricultural commodity prices compared to prices in the petroleum, oil and gas and mineral sectors, continues to constrain our national efforts to achieve sustainable development. We urge concerted global efforts to spur our economic growth so that we can support delivery on the SDGs.\nFor us, development cooperation is also an important element that constitutes 40 per cent of our annual development budget and remains a key component for the successful pursuit of our national development priorities, including the SDGs. For development partners to be meaningful supporters of national SDGs efforts, it is imperative that they align their assistance to national development policies, strategies and plans rather than undertake parallel paths that can be unhelpful.\nPapua New Guinea is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Therefore, in order to demonstrate our commitment to combating climate change, we supported the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, signed it in April 2016, and ratified and deposited the instrument of ratification at the Secretariat yesterday. We welcome and congratulate those countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement, and we urge those that have not yet done so to do so, particularly countries that emit high levels of carbon.\nI am also pleased to inform the Assembly that we have signed a privileges and immunities agreement with the Green Climate Fund yesterday. That will assist in facilitating the funding and support necessary for the implementation of our nationally determined contributions.\nAs an archipelagic State, Papua New Guinea is concerned with the state of the world\u2019s oceans, since a large proportion of our people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, including our cultural heritage, is linked with the oceans and seas. The health, productivity and resilience of the oceans and seas are increasingly under threat from uncontrolled and poorly regulated human activities, including illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, land-based pollution, plastic and marine debris, and ocean warming and acidification. In order better to address those concerns, my Government recently approved an integrated National Oceans Office, and we are setting in place, in close partnership with our development partners, the necessary policy framework and legislation.\nAt the regional level, under the auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum, our collective support, leadership and advocacy for a healthy, productive and resilient oceans and seas have been harnessed under the region\u2019s Pacific Oceanscape Framework. Papua New Guinea therefore welcomes and endorses the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 on oceans so as to advance action on the world\u2019s ocean development agenda. Likewise, we commend the United States Government for convening the Our Oceans Conference last week to address those concerns, including through the promotion of partnerships.\nIt is also important to ensure that the activities on the high seas not compromise efforts to conserve and sustainably use ocean resources within our national jurisdiction. For that reason, we urge a timely conclusion to the Preparatory Committee process on the elements of a draft text of an international, legally binding instrument, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nWe look to a secure future for our people, based on the sustainable development, management, conservation and use of our ocean and its resources. We must urgently change the way we think about our ocean and its resources. Transformational change and action must start now.\nThe international community is all too familiar with the constant and increasing calls by Member States and other stakeholders to reform the United Nations system, including the Security Council, so as to reflect today\u2019s global circumstances. While Papua New Guinea recognizes that changes in any institution are never easy, we remain concerned about the slow and merely incremental pace of the reforms of the United Nations. With respect to the Security Council, while we welcome the incremental progress made in the past year, we have, however, witnessed in the process of the selection of the next Secretary-General of the United Nations over the past few months the unjust and archaic procedures and processes that render the majority of sovereign Member States unequal in this premier multilateral forum that espouses sovereign equality.\nAnother glaringly unfair practice in the existing United Nations system is the underrepresentation of qualified women at the senior management level of the Secretariat. The United Nations must not merely preach about gender equality and empowerment, it must be seen to exercise and implement what it advocates. Nevertheless, Papua New Guinea commends the Secretary-General for his efforts to reform the United Nations system. Every effort must be made by all Member States to ensure that the United Nations is reformed to better suit today\u2019s world and be fit for purpose so as to serve its membership justly and fairly.\nWe thank the outgoing President of the General Assembly for his innovative initiative to introduce transparency and inclusiveness for Member States in what has long been a closed and opaque process in the selection of a new Secretary-General of the United Nations. Papua New Guinea notes the process underway to select the next Secretary-General to succeed the incumbent, whose term comes to a conclusion at the end of December 2016. Papua New Guinea looks forward to working with the next Secretary-General, and we pledge our support in continuing the reform agenda.\nOn behalf of Papua New Guinea, I join previous speakers in paying tribute to the current Secretary- General for his outstanding leadership in bringing the international community together to address the unprecedented challenges during his tenure of office. For Papua New Guinea, he has also been the champion of small island developing States and the Pacific. We deeply value and appreciate the fact that he is the only serving United Nations Secretary-General who has visited our region twice and has also enabled a regular annual dialogue with Pacific Islands Forum leaders, including his invitation to tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Those actions clearly attest to his visionary and caring leadership for our regional issues. On my Government\u2019s and the people\u2019s behalf, I wish him and his wife good health and every success in his next endeavour.\n"

        "file_text": "First and foremost, I would like to convey to the Assembly greetings from Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who, owing to pressing engagements at home, including dealing with the aftermath of the recent devastating earthquake in north-western Tanzania, could not attend today\u2019s meeting. He reaffirms Tanzania\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and its ideals, and wishes the Assembly success in its deliberations.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. My delegation wishes him and his team a successful tenure as they preside over our collective global agenda. Tanzania pledges its support and cooperation to him in discharging his duties and responsibilities. We would also like to commend his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the Assembly at its seventieth session, for his tireless efforts in sustaining momentum for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nI would like to assure the Assembly of Tanzania\u2019s continued support to our shared commitment to addressing the myriad challenges facing the world, including, but not limited to, poverty, injustice, climate change and violent extremism. The United Republic of Tanzania is counting on the leadership of the President in mobilizing the world to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Now that the framework for the global indicators is in place, the onus is on us to ensure effective implementation of the Agenda. We welcome the theme that the Member States adopted for this session of the Assembly \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. We recognize that it is an ambitious agenda and that much is at stake. We know that national efforts must be stepped up if we are to make the Agenda implementable.\nWe in Tanzania have integrated the SDGs into our national development plans and strategies, and in collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders, we have taken various steps to ensure effective implementation at the national level. Our second national five-year development plan, launched in June, whose theme is \u201cNurturing industrialization for economic transformation and human development\u201d, as well as our new 2016-2020 poverty reduction strategy for Zanzibar, are informed by the outcomes of both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063. They are the basic frameworks in our efforts to improve the welfare of Tanzanians and ensure that no one is left behind.\nIn spite of our national efforts, and a significant drive to mobilize domestic resources for implementing the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063, we have learned that on our own we cannot realize those ambitious goals in a timely manner. Individual and collective efforts at the local, national and international levels are imperative. We have an international and regional obligation to discharge our commitments in keeping with Goal 17 of the SDGs, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nGender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, as fundamental human rights, have now become an acceptable and enduring theme in humankind\u2019s pursuit of equality and justice, a scale for measuring social progress and an important goal in realizing sustainable development. Women\u2019s political and economic participation in leadership roles and decision-making strengthens democracy and equality and gives vigour to the economy. That is the essence of Goal 5.\nMoreover, while women\u2019s empowerment and full participation in society are important goals in themselves, they are vital to reducing poverty, achieving universal education, improving maternal and child health and fulfilling other development goals. Economic development is also a strategic tool for expanding women\u2019s political participation and leadership. Without a capacity to generate their own incomes, women face considerable barriers to reaching higher levels of education and obtaining health care and the autonomy needed to participate in politics. Collectively and universally, they represent more than half of the human resources and potential skills and talents available to humankind in our societies.\nTanzania is committed to promoting women\u2019s empowerment at all levels. We are striving to bring more women into the formal sector through capacity- building programmes and advocacy. We have removed discriminatory laws and policies with the aim of empowering women, including by reforming our land laws to entitle all to inheritance and equal access to land. Tanzania has continued to act to improve women\u2019s representation in decision-making bodies. The 2010 general elections saw 126 women elected, and by 2015 that number had increased to 142, amounting to 36.9 per cent of all parliamentarians in the country. It was during the 2015 elections that President Magufuli chose the first-ever female Vice-President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who also happens to be the person participating in the United Nations initiative for the empowerment of women. That reaffirms my country\u2019s determination to see more women in key decision-making positions and to continue scaling up such initiatives to empower women in Tanzania. The process is also increasingly owned by women themselves.\nGoal 16 of the SDGs recognizes that corruption undermines efforts to combat poverty and gender inequality. It denies access and acts as a tax on poor families in their access to their rights to public services. That is why the Government of Tanzania has waged a war on corruption by mainstreaming transparency, accountability and effectiveness in the delivery of services by public institutions. We have instituted mechanisms to promote ethical standards and ensure that those holding public office recognize that their primary responsibility is to provide quality and timely service to the public. We have complemented those efforts by enhancing public awareness of the evils of corruption. But national efforts to curb corruption cannot yield sustainable results without support from the international community. Developed countries must hold their investors and multinational companies accountable by ensuring that they pay the taxes they owe. In order to contribute to financing our development, they must also be ready to return the assets and funds that some unscrupulous leaders and individuals steal from developing countries and hide in overseas accounts.\nWe all know that young people are very important to a nation\u2019s development. They are not only the leaders of tomorrow, they are also the partners of today. Ignoring them can lead to catastrophe, as they are easily lured into harmful activities that are detrimental to society, such as drug trafficking and joining radical extremist groups and terrorist cells. Since young people form a large percentage of our population, we are taking measures to empower that crucial group, which we believe will champion our efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To that end, we have established a youth development fund that by March of this year had already lent a total of 1.6 billion Tanzanian shillings to 284 youth groups. We therefore call on our development partners to complement our efforts in the same cause.\nOne of the priorities of the Government of Tanzania is achieving inclusive and quality education for all. We believe that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for attaining sustainable development, and we are working tirelessly to ensure that all girls and boys receive a free primary and secondary education. The Government has reformed its curriculum to improve its provision of a quality education capable of addressing the needs of the twenty-first century. In addition, we are directing our education policy and strategy in order to reach specific vulnerable and marginalized populations, including girls, women and those with disabilities.\nWhen he took office, President Magafuli made primary and secondary education free for all children. The Government has set aside more than 263 billion Tanzanian shillings to cover the full cost of guaranteeing free primary and secondary education for all, thereby demonstrating its commitment to providing free, quality education to the people. The objective is to ensure that we meet target 4.1 of Sustainable Development Goal 4, which requires States to ensure that \u201call girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education\u201d.\nClimate change is poised to undermine national efforts to reduce poverty. The losses of human, natural, financial, social and physical capital caused by the adverse effects of climate change are of great concern to Tanzania as it strives to attain sustainable development. That is why we have made climate-change adaptation a national priority. Based on the effects of climate change, we have prepared a national adaptation programme of action and subsequent national adaptation plans for Tanzania, aimed at identifying immediate and long- term actions for addressing climate change through our national climate-change strategy.\nIt is our hope that the Green Climate Fund and other funds will provide the financial resources needed to address adaptation requirements, as their unavailability limits the delivery of national obligations. Our modest estimates show that we need approximately $500 million annually to address the already vivid impacts of climate change. It is therefore important for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to enhance efforts to address barriers to financial resources from such funds. That will allow developing countries, particularly those that are least developed, to access the necessary resources urgently and without conditionality.\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was truly historic. At the time of ratifying the Agreement, Tanzania submitted its intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) on both adaptation and mitigation under the Paris Agreement, and was among the first countries to do so. That was a demonstration of our firm commitment to fulfilling our obligations on the protection of the planet and humankind in general. Our INDCs cover both adaptation and mitigation in the context of our national development vision. With over 48 million hectares of forested land, which is more than 54 per cent of our land mass, Tanzania is already making a great contribution to the global community in terms of carbon sink. However, it concerns us that our nationally determined contributions as a global community are not adding up to the collective numbers that will make the world safe for humankind. Those countries with more responsibility and capacity must take the lead by reducing their emissions, since otherwise the Paris Agreement on Climate Change will have very limited effect, if any at all.\nTanzania has not been spared by the world drug problem. Illicit drugs trafficked from other regions are crossing our borders, and some of them remain in our communities. During his inaugural speech at the current session of Parliament, my President made a strong commitment to fighting illicit drug dealers and traffickers. In addressing the issue of international criminality, bringing major dealers to justice will be among the priorities on his agenda. In the clear knowledge that corruption is a barrier to fighting this menace, we are determined to tackle both evils concurrently. Our resolve will remain unshaken, and the Government will continue to strengthen control over the trade in and use of drugs. We need international cooperation in fighting these international crimes.\nThe horrific terrorist attacks in 1998 on the American Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam is a tragedy our people cannot forget. The increasing speed with which attacks by terrorists and other radical groups have spread around the world has caused the loss of life of thousands of innocent people and the destruction of property. Such acts continue to undermine national, regional and global efforts to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. Tanzania is cooperating with the international community to address this global threat and has taken several practical steps, including enacting the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2002, the Prevention of Terrorism Regulations of 2014, the Money Laundering Act of 2006 and the Amendment to Money Laundering Regulations of 2013. A Financial Intelligence Unit in the Ministry of Finance has also been put in place to combat the financing of terrorism. Furthermore, the Government has established a national counter-terrorism strategy, which coordinates the counter-terrorism efforts of our agencies. It is becoming increasingly evident that Tanzania, and East Africa as a whole, form part of the global terrorist agenda and strategy.\nWhile strengthening our legal framework and capacities to confront this menace, we continue to enhance international cooperation in dealing with terrorism. If we do not take stern measures now, we risk denying our achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. International terrorism has a grand strategy that intends to envelop and shackle not only East Africa but West Africa and North Africa too, before marching towards Southern Africa. This is a serious threat that must be collectively acknowledged and tackled by the international community.\nOn the subject of regional conflicts in Africa, Tanzania is concerned about the ongoing conflict in Burundi and its impact, including loss of life, damage to property and the displacement of persons. Tanazania has been one of the host countries for the refugees that flee Burundi sporadically. It is currently hosting more than 165 Burundian refugees who left because of the most recent conflict.\nThe East African Community member States are working hard to ensure the return of peace to Burundi. We believe that, under the able leadership of His Excellency Mr. Kaguta Yoweri Museveni, President of Uganda, as a mediator and His Excellency Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, former President of Tanzania, as a facilitator, the peace process, which is now back on track, will regain its former vigour so that it becomes as inclusive as possible and succeeds sooner rather than later.\nTanzania joins the international community in condemning the recent resumption of conflict in South Sudan. The situation has derailed the progress we had made towards settlement of the conflict and the reunification of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement, in which Tanzania and South Africa played a significant role. We call upon the parties to the conflict in South Sudan to continue working together in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)- led efforts to bring about peace. We hope the positive effects of the August 2015 IGAD peace agreement will continue to prevail and enable the peace process to move forward swiftly and successfully.\nAs the current Chair of the East African Community, Tanzania convened an Extraordinary Summit earlier this month to address the ongoing political impasse and security crises in both Burundi and South Sudan. It is my hope that both countries will put their national interests, particularly those of their people, first and end the conflicts. We invite the international community to take an interest in these issues, while leaving leadership to the East African Community. These conflicts must continue to be of concern not only to Africa but to the rest of the world, as they impact upon international peace and security.\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted numerous resolutions on Palestine and Western Sahara that demand attention and action. The non-implementation of these decisions erodes the credibility of the Organization. As States Members of the United Nations, we must ensure that we put into practice that which we deliberate and agree upon.\nUnilateral sanctions and embargoes imposed on countries are a hindrance to development and affect innocent civilians. While we welcome the resumption of bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba, we continue to reiterate our position in favour of the total elimination of embargoes for the betterment of the peoples of both countries. The early lifting of sanctions and embargoes will strengthen relations for the mutual benefit of both parties, the United States and Cuba.\nWe are currently witnessing a new process for selecting the next Secretary-General. We welcome the hearings of the General Assembly on all aspirants. The process has shown that it is possible for the new Secretary-General to be selected transparently and democratically by all Member States. Furthermore, my delegation is of the view that the Security Council should submit more than one name to the General Assembly for voting. In addition, Tanzania wishes to reaffirm the decision of the African Union Summit during its twenty-seventh ordinary session, held in July, that the selection of the Secretary-General should respect the principle of geographical rotation and take into account gender balance. The selection of the Secretary-General in 2016 will send a clear signal that the permanent members of the Security Council are also ready and willing to embark upon a reform of the Security Council. That process will enhance the credibility of the United Nations and begin the long-overdue reforms of the Security Council and the General Assembly.\nIn conclusion, Tanzania wishes to pay particular tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team, who will be ending their tenure at the end of 2016. Under the stewardship of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who led the Organization by example, we have been able to address in all honesty global issues ranging from climate change to development and peace and security. If other issues have lagged behind, he has at least put them on the agenda of the United Nations. We look forward to the new Secretary-General picking up where Ban Ki-moon leaves off.\n"

        "file_text": "This is a special moment for Fiji as you, Sir, assume the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session \u2014 the first Fijian and the first Pacific Islander to attain this high Office at the United Nations. Your nation is honoured and proud. On behalf of every Fijian, I offer you, Mr. President, my warmest congratulations and wish you every success as you guide our deliberations over the next 12 months.\nI want to thank those nations that supported Fiji\u2019s bid for the presidency, including our neighbours and friends among the Pacific small island developing States. I also thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark for his leadership during the seventieth session.\nFiji fully supports the agenda that you, Sir, have outlined for the coming session, which seeks to persuade the world to begin implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals that the 193 Member States adopted last year. As you rightly stated, Sir, when you took your oath of office last week, the seventy- first session must, for integrity\u2019s sake, be the year that we witness the wheels turning. We have collectively pledged to mobilize the global community to end all forms of poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change. And we have pledged that, as we do so, we will leave no one behind, wherever they live on the planet. That is our promise to the 7.5 billion people across the world, whose interests we represent. It is a promise that must be kept \u2014 a \u201cuniversal push to transform our world\u201d, as the theme of this session puts it.\nA centrepiece of the seventy-first session and one of our most critical priorities is the high-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, which is to be held in New York next June on the theme \u201cConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\u201d. Fiji is proud to be co-hosting that gathering with Sweden, and I ask everyone to give that initiative their full support. The world must act quickly and decisively to reverse the environmental degradation of our oceans and seas, and the reckless and irresponsible use of those precious resources.\nFor a small island developing State such as Fiji, that is as pressing as the need to address the challenges of climate change and deal with the extreme weather events and rising seas that pose such a threat to our way of life in the small island developing States and other vulnerable parts of the world. Many millions of people in maritime and coastal communities the world over are looking to us for decisive action to address the growing crisis of population, pollution, overfishing and the loss of marine habitats.We must not fail them.\nFiji also comes to the seventy-first session with a plea to all nations that have yet to do so to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We are proud to have been the first nation in the world to ratify the Agreement and launch the ratification instruments. But we also come with the message that Paris must be merely the first step. We are alarmed by scientific predictions that the 2\u00b0C cap on global warming over pre-industrial levels agreed to in Paris is not enough to save us.\nSeven months ago, the Fijian people were given a terrifying glimpse into the future that the experts say awaits us when we were struck by the biggest tropical cyclone ever to make landfall in the southern hemisphere, Cyclone Winston. Packing winds of more than 300 kilometres an hour, it killed 44 of our people and left many thousands homeless. Mercifully, it spared our main tourism areas \u2014 our principal source of income \u2014 so our wider community and our wider economy remained intact. But if this is what awaits us as global warming triggers weather events that are more frequent and more extreme, then God help us.\nIn common with other small island developing States, we face a nightmare scenario in which a single event scoring a direct hit could wipe out our economy, set us back for decades and make it impossible for us to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Our message from the Pacific therefore is this: the 2\u00b0C cap is not enough. We need the world to go one better and embrace the 1.5\u00b0C cap that we, members of the Pacific Islands Development Forum, called for in the Suva Declaration on Sustainable Human Development in the Pacific.\nWe also need deeper cuts in carbon emissions and more decisive global action than what we are currently witnessing. But as a first step, I appeal to all Member States to ratify the Paris Agreement and to turn away from what I have termed \u201cthe coalition of the selfish\u201d \u2014 those countries that would see vulnerable nations battered and submerged rather than alter their pampered, carbon-driven lifestyles.\nI am proud to report that Fiji is heeding the President\u2019s call to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. First and foremost, we have placed sustainable development at the core of our national agenda. The Green Growth Framework for Fiji, which I launched in 2015, is a blueprint for the future direction of our nation. It has been incorporated into our new five-year and 20-year national development plans that we will be unveiling in the coming months. These plans stipulate that no development whatsoever in Fiji will be permitted unless it can be conclusively demonstrated to be sustainable. We regard the preservation of our natural environment on land and at sea as our number-one priority. We are willing to make sacrifices to fulfil our solemn duty to the Fijian people to preserve their surroundings.\nArticle 40, paragraph 1, of our Constitution gives every Fijian the right to\n\u201ca clean and healthy environment, which includes the right to have the natural world protected for the benefit of present and future generations\u201d.\nI make a solemn pledge to my own people and to the wider global community that, while my Government remains in office, Fiji will never be among the ranks of those nations that have compromised their futures for short-term financial gain. We intend to raise our living standards by other means, especially by making things that other people want to buy and by providing services they want to access. We are taking the Fijian- made brand of quality products and services to the four corners of the Earth and managing our economy responsibly in accordance with international best practices, with a particular emphasis on infrastructure development, service delivery and providing for the less fortunate.\nOf prime importance is our education revolution, by which we are equipping Fijian young people with the knowledge and skills to have satisfying, sustainable livelihoods and contribute to our nation\u2019s progress. We are providing free schooling for the first time and have established our first tertiary loan scheme and more scholarships for gifted students in order to open up a gateway of unprecedented opportunity to our universities and a new network of technical colleges. We have set our sights higher than ever before to become a smarter, more dynamic country at the hub of the Pacific, the crossroads of our region, and to evolve into a modern nation State that is a beacon to our neighbours and respected around the world.\nI am pleased to report that we have made a strong start as a nation on the long but determined journey to achieve that goal. Not only are our people being given more opportunity than at any time in our history, not only are we creating a more equitable society, which includes targeted assistance for the vulnerable and the country\u2019s first pension scheme, but Fiji is also currently experiencing a record period of economic growth, with seven straight years of expansion.\nEven in the wake of Cyclone Winston, we expect to see growth of nearly 3 per cent this year. Our message to the world is simple: Fiji is open for business. Fiji has attractive incentives for investment and some of the most favourable corporate and personal tax rates in the Pacific region. We have state-of-the-art communications and an educated, English-speaking work force. We are investing in new roads, airports and other infrastructure and have dramatically improved the efficiency of our ports. We also have our pristine environment, spectacular islands, coastlines and waters. In addition, our standard of hospitality has made the Fijian people famous the world over.\nWe market ourselves to the world as a holiday destination with the slogan \u201cFiji \u2014 where happiness finds you\u201d. Whatever the challenges of Cyclone Winston, I can confidently say that the Fijian people have never been happier. The joy that erupted when our world-champion rugby sevens team won the gold medal at the Rio Olympics was shared by every Fijian. It has brought us together in celebration and seen us more unified in recent weeks than at any other time in our history. It has also inspired us to imagine what else our small nation can do if we put our minds to it.\nAs many in the Assembly are aware, we have had considerable challenges through the years in forging a common identity and producing an equal and just society for every citizen, but I am here to say that those days are over. As Fiji approaches its first half-century as an independent nation in 2020, we are finally one nation, one people, with a great sense of national optimism and a great deal to look forward to.\nTo reflect our new-found confidence, we are also in the process of re-evaluating our relationships with the rest of the world. Last week, I assumed the position of Foreign Minister as well as Prime Minister, and I intend to steadily reform this Ministry and to refine certain aspects of our foreign policy to give it a new direction and a renewed sense of purpose.\nFirst and foremost, we are going to place trade at the centre of our foreign-policy effort, with the promotion of the impressive collection of quality products and services under the Fijian-made brand. Some of these products and services are already making a global impact, but we believe we can do a lot more \u2014 whether it is our water, our cosmetics, foodstuffs and other manufactured goods, the more efficient marketing of Fiji as a prime holiday destination, or by spreading the wings of our boutique national airline, Fiji Airways, flying to other destinations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.\nWe intend to immediately boost the level of collaboration between our Foreign Ministry and our Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, which have too often operated in isolation. Our diplomats and trade commissioners will be instructed to make it a priority to work more closely with Fijian exporters to promote the Fijian-made brand, as well as to access goods and services of international standards from new and old trading partners that benefit Fijian consumers.\nMore broadly, we are rethinking some of our foreign policy positions and objectives. This includes a re-evaluation of the central principle of Fijian foreign policy for some years of being \u201cfriends to all and enemies to none\u201d.\nOf course, we seek friendly relations with all nations and are certainly not in the business of making enemies. But we intend, in future, to choose our friends in a more discerning manner and to align ourselves more closely with those countries that share our underlying values and principles. These include, above all, adherence to international law and adherence to human rights and human dignity, along with other shared values such as mutual respect, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the resolving of disputes by peaceful means and non-interference in one another\u2019s internal affairs.\nThis change of direction will not be sudden. It is certainly not going to produce a dramatic change in the international company that Fiji keeps. But we are definitely seeking closer relations with nations that share our values and basic outlook, especially those nations that respect human life and the rights and dignity of their citizens, adhere to the principle of social justice, uphold the rule of law and insist on equality and respect for all human beings, as we in Fiji do.\nAs part of our wider commitment to human rights, we are seeking membership in the Human Rights Council for the two-year term that commences in 2018. We would be the first Pacific nation to serve on the Council, and I ask all member States to support our bid.\nFiji will continue to play a disproportionate role in the international community in relation to its size, whether it be our continuing commitment to United Nations peacekeeping and sending our men and women in uniform to protect ordinary people in troubled parts of the world, or our lead role in drawing global attention to the urgent need for action on climate change.\nIt is certainly a proud moment for me, as the leader of our small nation, to stand here before the nations of the world with you, Sir, behind me, as President of the General Assembly. Congratulations again on your appointment. I thank you for bringing such honour to our nation. Every Fijian \u2014 indeed, the entire community of nations \u2014 wishes you well as you preside over the deliberations of this seventy-first session and the great issues of our time on which the future of the world depends.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the seventy-first session of the Assembly. I wish to assure him of Belize\u2019s fullest support.\nThirty-five years ago, Belize became a State Member of the United Nations. Membership confirmed our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and our place among equals in the community of nations. Regrettably, however, membership has not been able to resolve the territorial claim laid on our country some 80 years ago by Guatemala.\nOur track record since our independence confirms that Belize holds sacrosanct the dignity of human beings, the principles of justice, equality, inclusivity and the rule of law. Belizeans are inherently altruistic and compassionate. In the nascent years of our independence, when civil war ravaged our Central American region, Belize was the beacon of hope and sanctuary of choice for thousands of refugees, including Guatemalans, desperately seeking to escape the scourges of war, poverty and oppression. Belize welcomed thousands of refugees, amounting to well in excess of 30 per cent of our population at the time. Indeed, even to this day, the flow of migrants into our country continues unabated. Belize is a nation of migrants living in unity, peace and harmony.\nOur diversity, national identity and pride have long been a source of strength for our people. We have never cowered in the face of the repeated threats to our security by our neighbour, Guatemala. We remain steadfast in our resolve to protect and preserve our sovereignty and territorial integrity. Though many perils lurk along our forested borders and in our maritime and riverine territories, we have been protecting and patrolling our borders with determination, so as to ensure the safety and security of our beloved homeland. At the same time, our untiring diplomats have striven mightily to resolve the long-standing territorial dispute, which is our paramount foreign-policy concern, by using all the diplomatic channels and means at their disposal.\nRegrettably, though not unpredictably, there have been hostile incidents between the civilian and military personnel of both Belize and Guatemala on our southern border on the Sarstoon River. Guatemalan naval personnel have repeatedly impeded the peaceful ingress and egress of civilian and military Belizeans on the river, wrongfully claiming that the river is theirs. However, as the northern side of the river is clearly Belizean territory, the unimpeded use and enjoyment of that side of the river is the right of every Belizean citizen. Belize has therefore promptly and properly protested each attempt to impede our citizens from using the river. Additionally, we have engaged our Guatemalan counterparts in dialogue under the good offices of the Secretary General of the Organization of American States with a view of putting a speedy end to that potentially perilous practice.\nAt the same time, the situation along our western border has also been vexing. Continuous illegal entry by armed trespassers from Guatemala have persisted despite the valiant efforts of our border patrol to deter them. The trespassers engage with impunity, day and night, in gold panning, hunting for wild game and birds, pillaging Mayan temples, logging illegally and cultivating crops, including marijuana, for commercial purpose. In the process, our priceless forest is being decimated, our potable and sea waters are being compromised, and our coral reefs are being choked to death by sediments that run off the denuded mountainsides after each torrential downpour.\nFully cognizant of the devastating environmental impact that such practices are having in neighbouring countries and further afield, Belize cannot afford to let the same thing happen to us. From time to time, in the course of attempting to apprehend the trespassers, firearms have been used by Belize security personnel and by the trespassers, who are invariably armed. Indeed, between September 2014 and March 2016, a Belizean Tourism Police officer was killed and a Belize Defence Force sergeant was ambushed and shot, though not fatally, by trespassers entering Belize from Guatemala.\nTragically, and much to Belize\u2019s regret, on 20 April 2016 a Guatemalan minor was fatally shot and his father and brother injured when they came in contact with a Belizean patrol in one of our protected national parks in the dead of night. The Belize Police forthwith began an investigation. Moreover, officials of the Organization of American States (OAS), stationed in the Adjacency Zone between Belize and Guatemala, immediately commenced their own investigation. And, at the specific behest of Guatemala, Belize requested the Secretary General of the Organization of American States to launch an official special independent investigation into the incident. The Organization of American States commissioned two senior eminently qualified specialists to undertake that special investigation, with the full knowledge and approval of the Guatemalan Government. At the time of their appointment, Guatemala expressed no reservations as to their competence, suitability or otherwise, to undertake that investigation. Last August, the Special Commission delivered its findings to the Secretary General of the Organization of American States.\nThe report discloses that the deceased had been detained by security personnel in Belize a mere month prior to the incident. At the time of his detention, he was illegally carrying a .22-calibre rifle and was in illegal possession of wild game. He was neither mistreated, arrested nor prosecuted by the Belizean authorities. Instead, he was promptly sent back safely to his country. The report further discloses that the deceased, his brother, also a minor, and their father were knowingly and unlawfully well within Belizean territory on the night of the incident, and that none of the wounds inflicted was caused by weapons carried by personnel of the Belize Defence Force. The wounds were inflicted by small-calibre firearms carried on the night of the incident by two members of a local conservation-oriented non-governmental organization that was part of the Belize patrol. Shots were fired by both groups, the Guatemalans and the Belizean joint patrol, on that ill-fated night. And, the following morning, elements of the Guatemalan Army, along with civilians from a nearby Guatemalan village, entered Belizean territory illegally, visited the site, contaminated the scene and withdrew and withheld evidentiary material that could have been useful to the investigation.\nIn the wake of the incident, Guatemala launched a fanatical public-relations campaign against Belize, falsely alleging that the Belize Defence Force was responsible for the death of the minor. In addition, the Guatemalan President publicly announced the massing of troops along our western and southern borders.\nHowever, the report of the Special Independent Commission chronicles what really took place on the night of the incident. The objective, impartial findings of fact established the correctness of Belize\u2019s position from the start, and the wholly erroneous nature of the allegations levelled against our country by Guatemala. The report completely absolves Belize of any and all blame for the incident. It makes manifest the wrongness of Guatemala\u2019s accusation against Belize and against the personnel of our Belize Defence Force. Guatemala has since then publicly rejected the Commission\u2019s report. However, it is certainly irresponsible, if not reprehensible and utterly unacceptable, that Guatemala should now seek to reject the results of a process that it had specifically requested and agreed to and which was conducted by OAS-appointed independent third-country professionals with impeccable credentials and with no axe to grind. Moreover, the wanton threat of the use of force by a nation against its neighbour is wholly uncalled for, recklessly dangerous and in clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and can in no way be countenanced.\nBelize\u2019s only wish is to live in peace and harmony with all its neighbours, including Guatemala. We fully appreciate that with each passing day, with more and more Guatemalans trespassing into our country, despoiling our natural resources and engaging in illegal and destructive activities, the potential for violent incidents and conflicts has become increasingly probable and problematic. That situation makes a prompt and peaceful end to the anachronistic and unfounded territorial claim on our country an urgent imperative.\nBelize acknowledges the centrality of the United Nations in the multilateral order and as a uniting force for championing the common good. Its leadership likewise remains central to international peace and security, to development and to the rule of law. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is truly a historical milestone for the entire world. The essence of sustainable development is entrenched in the Belize Constitution. Our economic development has fully embraced the indivisibility of social and environmental policies. From the early 1990s, Belize began to put in place development plans for its fledgling industries that are consistent with a progressive legal regime for environmental protection.\nComplementary to those economic and environmental developments, Belize is incrementally providing free public education at the primary and secondary levels. It has established a Maya Land Rights Commission so as to implement measures for the identification and protection of rights arising from Mayan customary land tenure. It is rolling out a national health-insurance policy, and work is in progress to advance national efforts towards gender equality and equity.\nThe national debate on social issues recently took a turn that could set a precedent. A High Court ruling held that Section 53 of our Criminal Code, which criminalizes consensual sexual acts between same-sex partners, is unconstitutional. The ruling also expands the definition of \u201csex\u201d to include sexual orientation. However, in response to the request of a not inconsiderable segment of our population, our Government has launched a limited appeal against the judgment, challenging only the expanded definition of \u201csex\u201d by the High Court.\nIn April, Belize was among the first countries to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We also commend the United States of America and China for their leadership for doing so as well. Belize fully supports efforts, under the auspices of the United Nations, to design a new international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and welcomes the decision to convene a high-level United Nations conference to support the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 in June 2017.\nIn that spirit of inclusiveness, Belize urges that the Republic of China on Taiwan be accorded meaningful participation in the work of the United Nations. The Taiwanese Government has been working assiduously to promote international cooperation and development, in line with the spirit and principles of the Millennium Development Goals. It has also fully embraced the Sustainable Development Goals. We urge the international community to welcome Taiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in the mechanisms, meetings and activities of the United Nations specialized agencies, including the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nSetbacks in the global economy and externalities resulting from institutional policies, both public and private, to safeguard against financial and other security risks, as well as the adverse impacts of climate change, have all conspired against Belize\u2019s sustainable development trajectory. Today, we are rebuilding our country in the aftermath of Hurricane Earl, which in less than eight hours resulted in the loss of some 5.5 per cent of our gross domestic product.\nBelize fully endorses the views and sentiments that all other delegations have expressed in their pleas for urgent relief from the deleterious consequences of the decisions by global banks to withdraw correspondent banking relationships from our financial institutions.\nBelize celebrated its thirty-fifth anniversary of independence on the same day as the International Day of Peace. Peace and stability in our hemisphere are critical to the development and well-being of the peoples of the Americas. For that reason, Belize remains concerned about the status of the controversy\nbetween Guyana and Venezuela. We urge the Secretary- General to urgently exercise his authority under the 1966 Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana in order to arrive at a choice of options that would definitively settle the border controversy.\nBelize strictly adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. In that regard, we stand in solidarity with the Government and the people of Venezuela in their efforts to resolve their domestic issues in accordance with their laws and Constitution. We also remain very concerned about the unabated cholera epidemic in Haiti, and urge the United Nations to take all necessary steps to help the Haitian people end that terrible scourge, occasioned by agents of the United Nations. Belize welcomes the tremendous progress already made in the peace process in Colombia, which we fully support. We look forward to an early and successful implementation of the agreement. We also commend the progress made in the bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States. Belize reiterates its call for an early end to the economic embargo against Cuba.\nWe join others in calling for an early end to the tragic conflicts in Syria and Libya, which are an affront to humanity. We adhere fully to the right of peoples to self-determination, and reiterate our solidarity with the struggle for liberation and independence of our Sahrawi brothers and sisters. Belize remains disheartened, although not discouraged, by the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believe that the only just solution to that conflict is one that results in two sovereign and independent States, living side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders.\nWe stand in solidarity with South Korea in the face of North Korea\u2019s irresponsible experiments with nuclear and missile programmes, including the conduct of nuclear tests, in violation of Security Council resolutions. We join the international community in condemning those actions, which pose a clear and present danger not only to South Korea, but to the entire world.\nWhile we are heartened by the indefatigable efforts of the United Nations and other philanthropic organizations and individuals to alleviate the suffering of migrants and other displaced persons worldwide, it is evident that much more needs to be done. We in Belize pledge to do all in our power and within our means to discharge our obligations to all suffering persons who seek our succour.\nIn a country as small as Belize, in a world as big as ours, we are all citizens of planet Earth, big or small. The policies that we devise at any level must be reflective of that reality. It is up to us leaders, working together and shouldering our respective sovereign responsibilities, to ensure that every nation, large and small, and every individual, man, woman or child, shall have a say in our noble endeavours to achieve a more just, equitable and secure world. Our task is clear. Its attainment is not impossible, but neither is it without difficulty. Let us get it done. Belize stands ready to do its part.\nIn conclusion, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is beginning to prepare to leave office at the end of 10 sterling years of service to the United Nations and to the world as a whole, Belize takes this opportunity to thank him and to wish him every success in his post- Secretary-General life. We also take this opportunity to thank the United States President, Barack Obama, as he too prepares to leave office later this year. We wish him every success in his post-presidential life."

        "file_text": "May I take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. His distinguished career, experience and impeccable credentials assure us of a successful session. Let me hasten to pledge my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation to the President during his term of office. I also wish to commend his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his outstanding leadership during the previous session.\nSimilar accolades go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, under whose leadership the Organization continues to discharge its mandate with honour and commendable zeal. We may recall that, under his stewardship, the United Nations dealt with several challenges, most of which were handled with great success. As we prepare to bid him farewell, we do so with pride, as he has indeed discharged his responsibilities with honour and dignity. He will leave an indelible footprint, and his successor will follow in his footsteps, continuing the good work done.\nThe seventy-first session of the General Assembly comes at a time when the United Nations as an Organization has made significant strides in addressing many of the serious challenges facing the international community. It is to the credit of the United Nations that, since the end of the Second World War, no world- wide conflict has occurred, with the exception of localized skirmishes in various parts of the globe. The international community has enjoyed the longest period of sustained peace and development in modern history.\nThe intractable conflicts in the Middle East and Africa and the tension on the Korean peninsula and in other parts of Asia, as well as the biggest global refugee problem since the Second World War, are some of the challenges facing the United Nations and the world today. Terrorism continues to rear its ugly head \u2014 in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia \u2014 with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other terrorist entities indiscriminately causing great damage to property and the needless loss of lives. World security is indivisible. Threats of conflict, terrorism and famine in one part of the world will always have debilitating repercussions everywhere \u2014 the case in point being the influx of refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Asia into Western Europe.\nThe adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) last year and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change adopted at the recent Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are notable landmarks that have cemented the role of the United Nations as the only forum at which collective diplomacy can bear fruit.\nThe theme chosen for the current session, namely, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, is most relevant and appropriate at this time when humankind is tottering on a precipice resulting from hunger, poverty, disease and the adverse consequences of climate change. The theme highlights the collective desire of the United Nations to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions. As we may recall, the overriding message of the 2030 Agenda is to leave no one behind.\nThe unique and special challenges faced by the least-developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing States, as well as those emerging from conflicts, should be paramount in our minds as we consider strategies and steps to be taken to bring the Sustainable Development\nGoals to fruition. We believe that the inclusion of all stakeholders, especially women and youth, in programmatic and results-oriented action will bring about fundamental changes in the livelihoods and well- being of our societies. In Lesotho women constitute a significant majority of the population and are the backbone of our rural communities. Their human- resource potential must not be underestimated. It is for that reason that we have promulgated laws that allow them access to land, credit and the resources necessary for their unfettered engagement in community activity.\nYoung people are always at the receiving end of an economic downturn, anytime one occurs. Yet they are endowed with intellect, energy and the exuberance of youth, which can be harnessed for development in the long term. In line with the SDGs, we have undertaken to capacitate youth-owned micro, small and medium- sized enterprises so that they can acquire appropriate skills that will help them create jobs and take advantage of international markets already at their disposal. Special attention is being given to small and medium- sized enterprises, as they form an integral part of industry and are potential employers for unskilled and semi-skilled labour. It is also a point of entry for young entrepreneurs into the manufacturing and services sectors. In Lesotho\u2019s coalition agreement, we have committed to supporting micro, small and medium- sized enterprises through appropriate regulatory policies and access to finance.\nThe transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the SDGs has not been difficult, as there are many synergies and complementarities between the two programmes. We are also aware of the synergies that exist between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 and the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan of the Southern African Development Community. For our part in Lesotho, we have already begun a process to ensure that the three Agendas are mainstreamed into our national policies and plans. With our limited domestic resources, we are looking for innovative ways of pursuing our development priorities and aligning them to the global, continental and regional agendas. To that end, Lesotho has been working with the United Nations country office to conduct sensitization workshops on the SDGs. So far, we have conducted such workshops for the private sector, civil society and members of Parliament. We are in the process of reviewing our national strategic development plan so as to align it fully with the 2030 Agenda and regional and continental development plans.\nWe are convinced that a private-sector-led growth strategy that ensures that that sector contributes to economic growth, job creation, poverty alleviation and sustainable development is vital for competition, the expansion of trade and investment opportunities. Sustainable Development Goal 9, which enjoins us to \u201cbuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\u201d, recognizes the importance of infrastructure, industrialization and technology for the progress and development of countries like Lesotho.\nEconomic development cannot be sustainable without a conscious effort to protect the environment. The adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015 is another milestone in the global effort to safeguard and promote humankind\u2019s continuing progress and survival. We welcome the pledges by developed countries to make resources available for the Green Climate Fund.\nThe threats posed by underdevelopment, climate change and HIV/AIDS have pricked the conscience of humankind for many years. Lesotho has adopted an innovative, indigenous leadership programme that seeks to galvanize the collective wisdom of all levels of leadership to join in the fight against HIV/AIDS in particular, and to ensure that the health delivery system is affordable, accessible and effective. The programme was launched by His Majesty King Letsie III on 25 August. We also launched a test-and-treat programme in April and revived the National AIDS Commission. Those are just a few of the initiatives that the Government of Lesotho has taken to curb new infections, maternal deaths and new incidences of tuberculosis.\nWe recognize the role of disarmament in the maintenance of international peace and security, and Lesotho remains fully committed to the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We therefore call upon all the nuclear-weapon States to start making deep cuts in their current nuclear-weapon stockpiles, with the ultimate aim of finally eliminating them altogether. The African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty, which entered into force in July 2009, is a clear demonstration of the continent\u2019s desire for peace and genuine nuclear disarmament.\nWe should all remain true to the principle of the responsibility to protect, which the General Assembly unanimously adopted less than a decade ago. That principle imposes upon us the responsibility to create conditions of peace, security and harmony, while leaving no room for hostility, violence or aggression. We therefore remain committed to supporting actions by the Security Council that include authorization for military intervention where necessary. Our understanding is that the principles in international law on the non-use of force in international relations, respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States, as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, remain paramount and sacrosanct in all instances. We commend the Security Council for its work undertaken in keeping with those principles throughout the years.\nFor that reason, I wish to reiterate Lesotho\u2019s well- known position on the reform of the Security Council, in line with the established position of the African Union, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. We strongly urge that the very important issue of Security Council reform should not be turned into a joke. The sooner it is concluded, the better for humankind and for peace in the world.\nWe furthermore reiterate our position on the one-China policy, a position that will ensure that the people of China are not dismembered and huddled into imaginary geographic segments.\nThe right to self-determination and independence is a God-given right that cannot be taken away arbitrarily. It is for that reason that we have never wavered in our support for the independence of the people of Western Sahara. We call upon the United Nations to assist the Secretary-General in resuscitating the negotiations on the holding of a referendum in Western Sahara, so as to determine the will of the Saharawi people. We also urge the Kingdom of Morocco to support the process, so as to bring a lasting solution to the matter and facilitate the return of Morocco to its rightful place in the African Union family.\nBy the same token, the plight of the Palestinian people has been on the international community\u2019s agenda for far too long. We call for a new initiative that will buttress all efforts aimed at a two-State solution, with the State of Israel and that of Palestine existing side by side in peace. A fresh initiative is required to restart the process that produced the Oslo Accords and bring an end to the suffering of the communities concerned, which have endured aggression for more than 60 years. Surely, a permanent resolution of that seeming impasse is now overdue and urgent for the benefit of the neighbouring countries as well and the world at large.\nAs I conclude, let me express our hope and expectation that in the next decade, the efforts of the United Nations aimed at accelerating the pace of economic development on a global scale will begin to show tangible results. Let us work together to create a world where the foundations of world peace and security will continue to rest, not on the absence of war but on the international principles of non-aggression, the non-use of force in inter-State relations and the peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We will, hopefully, continue to consolidate the foundations of a world where the true definition of peace will manifest itself in harmonious relations among peoples and in mutual respect and understanding between nations. We will continue to build prosperity for our peoples on the basis of the agreed principles embodied in the SDGs, which represent a pragmatic and visionary programme that seeks to free humankind from the bondage of hunger and poverty. We will ultimately embrace the need to allow reason to prevail over might. That is the future of our dreams \u2014 the future that we owe to posterity.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, Permanent Representative of Fiji, who has been elected President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We wish him every success in discharging his mandate. Chad pledges its full support.\nI would also like to congratulate and thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, outgoing President of the General Assembly, for his dedication and his many initiatives to strengthen the role of the Assembly, the most democratic and representative entity of the United Nations.\nAt the same time, on behalf of Chad and the African Union, I would like to congratulate and render a heartfelt tribute to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate will soon come to a close. His leadership, commitment and unflagging dedication during the past 10 years have contributed to buttressing the role of the United Nations and promoting its ideals.\nFounded over 70 years ago by 51 Member States, the United Nations today now consists of 193 Member States. The evolution of humankind has made our States\n10/56 16-29296 increasingly interdependent and interconnected, just as the challenges have become global and collective in nature. The world in which we live is facing multidimensional threats which prompt great concern.\nArmed conflict, terrorism, climate change, mass migration, underdevelopment, poverty, and political, economic and financial crises have reached unprecedented proportions. No continent or region of the world has been spared by at least one of those scourges. Citizens of the world from all walks of life in some cases live in a perpetual state of fear and in others in a state of despair because wars, indiscriminate violence, poverty and the adverse effects of climate change are on the rise and there is slim hope of solving those problems.\nThe growing number of refugees and displaced persons throughout the world; the ongoing shipwrecks of makeshift boats in the Mediterranean, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives; and the Syrian tragedy, which has been unfolding before our eyes for more than five years, among other challenges, are tangible events that eloquently illustrate our collective powerlessness.\nIn this world of uncertainty, Africa is the most vulnerable and exposed continent. The victim of colonial plunder and affected by the numerous problems caused by underdevelopment, Africa is today under full attack from terrorism \u2014 the greatest threat of the century. Somalia, Libya, Mali, the Lake Chad basin and the Sahel in general are seriously destabilized and the danger is threatening to spread throughout the entire continent. Despite their modest means, the African Union and its member States are highly mobilized and committed to fighting this absolute evil.\nThat is evidenced by the great sacrifices that the African Union Mission in Somalia has made since 2004, the implementation of the Multinational Joint Task Force by States of the Lake Chad basin and Benin to fight the Boko Haram terrorist group, and the establishment of the Group of Five for the Sahel, which is a framework for security cooperation and countering all cross-border threats in the countries of the Sahel. This impetus for mobilization should be strengthened and supported by the entire international community by all means available, including physical, financial and military, as well as through intelligence-sharing. In that regard, from this rostrum I appeal to all States Members of the United Nations, particularly Africa\u2019s partners, to contribute to the African Fund Against Terrorism created by the African Union at its Summit, held in Kigali in July.\nAfrica is also working with great diligence to manage the crises and conflicts besetting it by promoting a regional approach to crisis resolution, underpinned by a peace and security architecture. Such an approach, which is deserving of the firm support of the international community, seeks to strengthen the response capacity of regional and subregional organizations in the light of their geographical proximity, knowledge of the terrain and their rapid and flexible deployment capabilities. The African Union Mission in the Sudan, the African Union Mission in Somalia, the African-led International Support Mission in Mali and the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic are concrete examples of the efforts of the African Union.\nThe complexity of conflicts throughout the world, including in Africa, is such that no organization can resolve them alone. That is why the African Union has always advocated a strategic partnership with the United Nations to confront security challenges on the continent. The African Union has deployed all of the aforementioned operations on behalf of the international community and in deference to the purview of the Security Council. Consequently, the African Union can legitimately count on the multifaceted and financial support of the United Nations.\nWe welcome the fact that this long-held position of the African Union is endorsed in the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations in its 20l5 report (see A/70/95), which has been unanimously praised. Accordingly, in the spirit of shared responsibility, at its latest summit the African Union adopted a measure to shoulder 25 per cent of the cost of peacekeeping operations authorized by the Security Council on the continent. The African Union hopes to receive the remaining 75 per cent from the United Nations peacekeeping budget, in keeping with the spirit of the division of labour and cost- sharing. The African Union anxiously awaits the start of constructive discussions with the United Nations on this proposal in order to reach an agreement that could further strengthen the exemplary partnership between the African Union and the United Nations in the interests of peace and the protection of civilians in times of crisis.\n16-29296 11/56 The political and security situation in many African countries concerns us deeply. Mali remains a target of attacks by terrorist groups despite the presence of United Nations forces on the ground and the peace agreements reached following arduous negotiations in Algiers. The international community must undertake an in-depth analysis of the situation with a view to ending the conflict through dialogue, without losing sight of tailored and appropriate responses to the terrorist threat.\nThe situations in Libya and South Sudan remains extremely troubling and requires a more substantial mobilization on the part of the international community, with the vigorous engagement and coordination of the respective regional organizations involved in resolving the crises. In that respect, the joint effort of the African Union and the United Nations to deploy a civilian protection force of 4,000 men, in addition to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, is to be commended. We also call for more concerted efforts between the African Union High-level Implementation Panel for the Sudan and South Sudan and the United Nations to persuade the non-signatories of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur to commit to it.\nDespite the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections, the situation in the Central African Republic remains fragile, as evidenced by the latest clashes between armed groups within the country. That situation requires a long-term follow-up, and the newly elected Central African authorities must be further supported in their efforts to normalize the situation in their country. I call on the international community to maintain and strengthen its support for peacebuilding and national reconciliation there. We also urge the political actors in brotherly countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Gabon, to prioritize dialogue and cooperation with regard to pre- and post-electoral crises. The African Union is ready to assist them in settling their disputes through peaceful means.\nThe serious crises affecting Iraq, Syria and Yemen call on our collective conscience concerning the many who have been killed, wounded, displaced or made refugees, as well as to the destruction of their vital infrastructure. The international community must urgently find a political solution to all of these crises through direct negotiations between the parties in conflict. Concerning the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, we call for a definitive, just and equitable solution that guarantees security for Israel and an independent and viable State for Palestinians, urging both parties to resume dialogue and relaunch the peace process, and setting out a clear framework for future negotiations, along with a deadline, that will make it possible to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.\nAfrica is not only a gigantic reservoir of raw materials; it is also home to more than 1 billion men and women who yearn for harmonious development accompanied by social well-being and prosperity. The international community can eradicate poverty in the world only if it upholds the commitments made within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which puts people at the very core of all concerns. The implementation of the Agenda must be an absolute priority in order to eliminate extreme poverty, fight climate change, strengthen resilience and promote sustainable economic growth that will benefit all.\nIn this respect, we stress the urgent need for an effective mobilization of the resources necessary to finance development in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Africa is committed to playing its part by ensuring an effective coordination of efforts as well as consistency among the goals of both Agenda 2063 and Agenda 2030. No region of the world, no State can prosper alone or be surrounded by an ocean of destitution and poverty without experiencing the consequences.\nThe successive waves of young African migrants moving towards Europe that we see on a daily basis, thousands of whom have drowned, are a challenge to the conscience of the international community. Though we may erect barriers, build ghettos and mobilize naval forces to contain migrants, the phenomenon will not stop until the regions concerned are closely involved in a suitable collective response. The solutions outlined at the 2015 Valletta summit seem, unfortunately, to have fallen short of our expectations and of the challenges. It is not a matter of providing charity to Africa, but, rather, of establishing with it a true strategic partnership aimed at tackling common global challenges. It is not too late to begin collective and concerted action that takes on board the legitimate concerns of all the parties concerned.\n12/56 16-29296 One of the major challenges facing Africa is climate change and environmental issues. The advance of the desert, the silting up of the Niger river, the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in southern Africa and deforestation are all the most striking signs of climate change in Africa. Lake Chad has shrunk from 25,000 square kilometres in 1960 to less than 2,000 today; this is additional proof of the degradation of our planet\u2019s climate. This ecological disaster, which is endangering coexistence among communities and dangerously threatening food security in the Sahel, will certainly have consequences for the security and the stability of the region, as we see from the strong presence and the accelerated development of the terrorist threat.\nThe partnership with Africa must also be seen in the fight for the preservation of the environment, which is seriously threatened. In this respect, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, signed on 22 April by all States, creates new obligations and a structural framework for the long-term fight against climate change. There is a great deal left to do to in order to achieve tangible achievements in the implementation of the commitments undertaken by all parties according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.\nThe Agreement will be credible only if it is accompanied by specific action aimed at bridging the enormous gap between the efforts that have been pledged and the noble objectives that are sought, including those established at Copenhagen, namely, mobilizing $100 billion by 2024 for the poorest countries.\nThe question of United Nations reform, and specifically that of the Security Council, remains a major concern for Africa, which, because of a historical injustice, remains marginalized in this organ. It is unfortunate that such reform, which the African Union has called for at every one of its summits for years, does not seem to prompt any interest. Nonetheless, Africa will continue to call for the creation of a more just and equitable universal Organization, while reaffirming its position on this matter as expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus.\nConfidence and hope in the global solutions that the United Nations inspires will be well founded only if all nations, in their diversity, take part in their design and implementation. All of us, as in a marriage, must be faithful to humankind, for better and for worse.\n\u2003\n"

        "file_text": "This year marks the twenty- fifth anniversary of Latvia\u2019s independence and membership in the United Nations. My country took its rightful place at the United Nations in 1991, with the clear objective of making a contribution to the collective security, stability and prosperity of the world. As a responsible democratic State based on the rule of law and respect for human dignity and freedom, Latvia remains strongly committed to the essential work of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations has been, and will be, our platform for global engagement. The far-reaching agreements on sustainable development and climate change have restored trust in the multilateral system\u2019s ability to deliver solutions on pressing global issues. More than ever, the world has great expectations that the United Nations will meet the rising challenges for peace and development and deliver effective and prompt results.\nLast year, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we all pledged to leave no one behind. This promise supports poverty eradication and development efforts in the most challenging contexts. It means addressing persistent vulnerabilities and building resilience in complex, protracted crises and conflict-affected populations. Therefore, strengthening the development and security nexus must become our mission.\nAll people have the right to live in peace and security in their own countries. Conflicts, poverty, disasters and climate change have contributed to the rise of large movements of refugees and migrants. Some 125 million people around the world are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. The current unprecedented migration crisis cannot be addressed by the most affected countries alone; it is a global phenomenon that requires joint efforts and shared responsibility. The global commitment to shared responsibility shown at the United Nations summit held on Monday goes hand in hand with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sustainable solutions must be found to ensure opportunities for education, employment and business for persons forcibly displaced during protracted crises and conflicts and to provide support for host communities and countries.\nThe development of peaceful and inclusive societies, good governance and respect for human rights will also help us to tackle the spread of violent extremism, while military and security measures are necessary to combat Da\u2019esh and similar groups. We need to address the root causes of people\u2019s willingness to choose violent extremism.\nLatvia is part of the global coalition against Da\u2019esh that has been instrumental in combating the group in Iraq and Syria. We welcome the NATO decision to step up support for the efforts of the coalition to that end. Only unified, coordinated, collective action at the global, regional and national levels will help us succeed in confronting the new, unconventional threats.\nTerrorist attacks continue almost daily. Fighting terrorism must remain our priority. The international community needs a plan for building resilience in the communities that for years have suffered under the barbaric rule of Da\u2019esh. The willingness of local populations will also be required if their future is to be shaped by the primacy of the rule of law and human rights, thus countering the factors conducive to radicalization, extremism and terrorism.\nWe will not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals without sustaining peace and preventing conflict. The need for decisive political action to address and prevent the conflict that causes massive displacement and suffering is more urgent than ever. The international community must find political solutions.\nThe security challenges in the Middle East are marked by a high degree of complexity, spillover and refugee flows. After five years of civil war, Syria has been destroyed. Attacks against civilians, medical facilities and schools continue. This is unacceptable. The perpetrators of international crimes must be brought to justice. A real nationwide ceasefire and improved humanitarian access are the prerequisite for the resumption of talks. Latvia has provided its contribution to mitigating the consequences of the conflict. However, only credible and inclusive political solutions will return Syria to stability. All members of the International Syria Support Group must put their political weight behind the United Nations-led process.\nIn Libya, the institutional vacuum has created a breeding ground for terrorist groups such as Da\u2019esh. The unification and cohesion of rival parties in Libya is a key element for the country\u2019s long-term stability and its success in the fight against terrorists.\nIran\u2019s diligent implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency will contribute to greater stability in the Middle East. In contrast, North Korea\u2019s irresponsible actions, including its repeated nuclear tests, undermine the security of all countries in the region and beyond.\nWe support all recent international efforts aimed at making progress towards the resumption of the Middle East peace process and find common ground that will bring the two parties back to meaningful dialogue. There is no alternative to a two-State solution reached through peace negotiations.\nEnsuring long-term stability in Afghanistan is of vital importance for global and regional security. Adverse developments in that country can have spillover effects on the neighbouring countries of Central Asia, which undermines their potential to develop economic connectivity at the macroregional level. Latvia provides Afghanistan with political and financial support for reform in the country. We call on more active regional cooperation, together with continued international support, to sustain the growth and prosperity of Afghanistan and its people.\nIn many other countries, the political situation is highly volatile, and some are engulfed in conflict. The United Nations and its peace efforts can help to stabilize these countries and gradually bring them back to normalcy.\nWe support the United Nations in its aim to make peacekeeping more effective through updating available tools for meeting new challenges. Better planning, equipment and training will improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping and the protection of civilians. There should be greater focus on strengthened collaboration with regional organizations. Building upon experience from other international operations, Latvia is now involved for the first time in a United Nations peacekeeping operation, in Mali.\nThis is still a very turbulent time for European security. For Latvia, the stability and security of Europe\u2019s neighbours in the East is a strategic priority and remains high on our political agenda. The resolution of protracted conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh should have priority on the international agenda. We must remain vigilant and insist that all States, including Russia, abide by their obligations under international law with regard to respecting the borders of sovereign States.\nTogether with the international community, Latvia will continue to stand for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We refuse to recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation; it must end. Any discrimination against the Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea requires a firm reaction from the United Nations. The international community must work to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. All parties must fulfil their commitments under the Minsk agreements and make the Minsk process work. Latvia continues to support Ukraine in its reforms and with its humanitarian needs.\nThe United Nations capacity to address current challenges also depends on the political will to make progress on the necessary reform of the Security Council, which is long overdue. We should all be aiming to strengthen the legitimacy of this important body. Accordingly, the permanent members of the Security Council should refrain from using their veto power in situations involving atrocity crimes. Latvia supports not only this important initiative, but also the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group\u2019s code of conduct on Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nWe are determined to maintain the political momentum for climate action. In April of this year, Latvia signed the historic Paris Agreement. We will strive to ratify the Agreement as soon as possible and encourage others to do the same. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been driving the push for worldwide action on climate change and gender equality. Latvia is grateful to him for his leadership and dedication over the past decade.\nThe scope of challenges that the world faces is daunting. The bold global agenda requires leadership. The expectations placed on the next Secretary-General of the United Nations are therefore as high as ever. This important job requires courage and readiness to effectively tackle the issues that we face. While we are looking for the best-qualified candidate, we also recall that Eastern Europe is the only region that has never held the post of Secretary-General. I am equally convinced that after 70 years, it is time to choose a woman for the Organization\u2019s top job.\nThere are many challenges that shape the evolving global landscape, but we now see the clear outlines of the new and better world that can be reached through diligent implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Implementation of the new Agenda will not be easy. Only through an informed and active society, in true partnership with all stakeholders, and through review of the progress made, will we be able to achieve the necessary transformative change by 2030. This is the time for us to act together responsibly. Latvia will continue to play its part in shaping a better future for us all.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I am pleased to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to reaffirm the United Arab Emirates\u2019 support for his efforts during his term. I would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his wise leadership during the previous session.\nIn our region and beyond, several countries have confronted multiple ongoing crises and conflicts since 2011. A number of Arab countries, including Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Syria and Somalia, have descended into internal fighting. At the same time, the plight of the Palestinian people persists under Israeli occupation without a just solution on the horizon, one that could restore the rights stripped from the Palestinians and establish their State based on the June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nFurthermore, regional interference in Arab affairs, perpetrated mainly by Iran \u2014 the only country in the world with a Constitution that explicitly calls for the export of its revolution \u2014 has aggravated conflicts in the region. The past few years have shown that solutions based on crisis management are ineffective. Therefore, joint international efforts must focus on resolving the crises and conflicts \u2014 not just managing them.\nWe are all aware of the violence and terrorism around us, which have taken unprecedented forms, relying on heinous methods and causing fear and terror not only in the Middle East, but also in many countries worldwide. That demonstrates that violence and terrorism must no longer be associated with a single State or region, as they are global threats that recognize no borders. The serious challenges facing our region and many other countries require our joint consideration of ways to address them and reach consensual, timely, effective solutions, without undermining the ongoing significant efforts in that regard.\nCountering terrorist groups is a right and duty of all States. However, resorting to laws that ignore the effective role played by a number of States in counter- terrorism would lead to suffering in many States. In that respect, we recall the so-called Justice against Sponsors of Terrorism Act in the United States of America, which has resulted in arbitrary policies and the destabilization of existing strong relationships among allies. I will attempt to present some thoughts on ways to diagnose the crises and determine potential solutions.\nFor example, Iraq has been suffering for more than a decade from nearly daily acts of sectarian violence. Iin addition, a part of its territory is under the control of terrorist groups, thus spreading fear and terror in the hearts of the Iraqi people and undermining the region\u2019s integrity. Moreover, interference by Iran in Iraq\u2019s internal affairs has exacerbated divisiveness among the Iraqi people. Yet there is no comprehensive political solution that can promote consensus among the Iraqi people and put an end to the marginalization of whole sections of Iraqi society.\nWhat have the effective Powers done in that regard? What have the prominent Powers capable of addressing those serious crises done? Those Powers, or so-called super-Powers, have simply tried to minimize the impact without resolving the crisis. That approach has merely made the crises increasingly complex, with the collapse of State institutions and the emergence of terrorism and extremism. Thathasled to the high price being paid, especially in terms of the loss of life on the part of the region\u2019s children, as well as their futures.\nWe find that Iran, as a result of its expansionist regional policies, has led the region to the brink of disaster. Through its constant interference in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries, it has played the greatest role in causing tension and instability in the region. Despite the so-called nuclear agreement reached between Tehran and the P5+1 \u2014 which was welcomed by countries in the region in the hope that the deal would change Iran\u2019s hostile approach \u2014 and despite all of the optimistic expectations, we have faced a different reality in that Iran has wasted no time in pursuing efforts to undermine regional security through aggressive rhetoric, blatant interference, the training and arming of militias and the development of its ballistic missile programme. Iran has been designated a State sponsor of terrorism, in itself quite alarming. Yet, despite all of the above, Tehran has refused to rescind its policies, which means that in order to confront and solve the crises, we must deal with Iran\u2019s behaviour.\nA further example of that trend can be seen in the decision of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to develop its nuclear and ballistic capacities and carry out regular testing, which threatens its neighbours\u2019 security, as well as international peace and security, and is clearly contrary to the most fundamental rules of international law. The same can be said of the crises in Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia. The lack of awareness of those crises and the lack of timely responses aimed at preventing the exacerbation of the suffering of many people are evident in the current developments in the Arab region, where the repercussions of certain crises have gone beyond borders.\nThe ensuing refugee crisis and mass exodus from conflict areas and the consequent pressures on many countries have indicated the need to work together within and beyond our region to develop solutions that rise above individual interests. That provides yet another example of how ignoring crises or settling for managing them, rather than finding tangible solutions, has further exacerbated the crises and transformed the situation into one that is more complex and compartmentalized.\nDespite the gravity of the crises that we all face, finding solutions is not impossible, if the international community and interested sides demonstrate good will and the political determination to resolve them. Allow me, in that regard, to offer the following thoughts:\nFirst, solutions must be based on justice and respect for the law. Without exception, no role should be given to any extremist, terrorist or evil party or group under any circumstances. We call on Iran and all regional parties to abandon the evil role that they are playing, which incites sectarianism and further ignites tension. Secondly, we must attempt to resolve some of the fundamental crises in a number of countries in the region, which is key to finding solutions to other crises, particularly in Yemen and Libya.\nIn Yemen, there have been a number of initiatives, including an effective road map put forward by the legitimate Government of Yemen, now in Kuwait, and at the Quartet meeting held in Jeddah in August, that could have saved the Yemeni people from their suffering. We hope that those efforts can result in a political solution \u2014 if the intentions of the militias in Yemen are sincere and if they live up to the standards of the international community and uphold their responsibilities as Yemeni nationals.\nThe United Arab Emirates also welcomes the Skhirat Agreement reached by the parties in Libya, as well as the formation of the Government of National Accord. We hope that it will lead to constitution-building in Libya and strengthen cooperation between the Presidential Council and the House of Representatives, which are the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people. That would result in a more unified Libyan national Administration capable of protecting Libya\u2019s territorial integrity and maintaining the unity of the people.\nThe United Arab Emirates sees no possibility of resolving the Syrian crisis through anything other than a political solution. There is no possibility of resolving it through military force. To date, that path has only intensified the suffering of the fraternal people of Syria and led to increased flows of refugees to other countries. The crisis has been further complicated by interference on the part of Iran and its terrorist militias in Syrian affairs. That has distorted the vision for Syria and derailed it from the existing path.\nOur hearts bleed when we see the brotherly people of Syria attempting to flee from death. We are deeply saddened that the Syrian people, known for their dignity and ancient civilization, are forced by the ongoing fighting in their country to fall into the hands of an unknown fate, a fate that began with forced displacement, with no end in sight. In addition, they experience humiliation as they are turned away from the borders of other countries. The repercussions of the Syrian crisis \u2014 and the impact of violence, displacement and an uncertain future \u2014 will affect future generations of Syrians.\nThese examples affirm the regional view that settling for crisis management, repeating charitable humanitarian efforts or holding recurring international conferences will not substitute for solving those crises.\nDespite the complexity of the crises overtaking our region, there is still hope for overcoming and resolving them. That is evident in the solutions adopted by the United Arab Emirates and the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which will, we hope, have a positive impact on other countries in the region. The United Arab Emirates firmly believes in the values of justice, international law, human rights and good governance. We wish to provide an enhanced environment of happiness for our citizens and residents. We believe that true development does not focus solely on the economic factors but also on the people themselves, based on the principles of tolerance, the acceptance of others and equality for all.\nThe empowerment of women is a central policy in my country, based on a belief in the pioneering societal role they play. The education of our citizens is also a priority, and we have developed policies and legislation to reflect that. We believe that the essential framework to achieve those goals should be based on protecting the State, in particular from extremism and sectarianism. That would solidify and strengthen our State against factors of disintegration and collapse that have threatened other countries in the region.\nIn that regard, we have established the Hedayah Centre to counter extremism and have participated with the United States in the establishment of the Sawab Centre. Additionally, the Muslim Council of Elders and the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies were established to show the true face of Islam. Those institutions aim to protect young people who have been attracted by extremist, sectarian and terrorist groups and counter the false claims of such groups.\nThe crisis in our region should not distract us from our core national cause, which is United Arab Emirates sovereignty over its three islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which are being occupied by Iran against the provisions of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. My country has called on our neighbour Iran time and time again to return those occupied islands to their rightful owner, the United Arab Emirates, either voluntarily through peaceful means or through international justice and arbitration. in order to maintain friendly, neighbourly relations in the Persian Gulf. We will never give up our sovereign right over those islands, and our approach is based on the principles of international law.\nOur faith in the role of the United Nations and its organs, especially the Security Council, in maintaining international peace and security is unwavering. We expect the United Nations to play an effective and vital role in resolving conflicts, strengthening the ability of States to resolve conflicts through a framework based on respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.\nTTo enable the Security Council to carry out that role, the Council members need to work together for the benefit and well-being of our region. In order to ensure that the United Nations is effective in a multipolar world, we must grant the General Assembly a greater role and pay more attention to early planning so as to promote security and stability. We can do that through constructive strategies and programmes that aim to achieve sustainable development, eradicate poverty, fight inequality, address climate change, defend human rights and much more.\nWe are firmly convinced that the effectiveness of the United Nations and its principal organs can be achieved through institutional cooperation with regional organizations, using clear mechanisms of cooperation, and that such cooperation is the cornerstone of the United Nations work.\nThe United Arab Emirates looks forward to working with the incoming Secretary-General with a view to promoting the work and effectiveness of the United Nations, so as to ensure further progress and find solutions to conflicts, as well as build the capacities required to maintain international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "As we approach the close of this day, I feel the responsibility to refer from this rostrum to the statement addressed to all of us by the President of the United States, Barack Obama (see A/71/PV.8). In summarizing the past eight years of his presidency and his relationship with the United Nations, he highlighted how the international context today is riven by a deep division between the world of fear and the world of courage, between the world of resentment and the world of hope, and between anger and opportunity.\nA new season is therefore beginning, one filled with opportunities and possibilities, but also with unprecedented threats and difficulties that, until a short while ago, had seemed in all likelihood to be very remote. Foremost among them is the threat of terrorism to our cities, to everyday life. Terrorism no longer strikes only conventional targets, but rather the human dimension: a theatre, a restaurant, a museum, a stadium. Also pressing are the risks connected with pandemics, which are sometimes exaggerated but very often constitute grave risks, as well as the risks connected to the environment, to which this community of women and men, together with my colleagues, was able to give a response by signing the important Paris Agreement on Climate Change this past April.\nBut there are also risks linked with other events that combine to make the future seem more a time of concern than of hope, from risks connected to natural disasters \u2014 one of which Italy experienced a few weeks ago in Amatrice, Cumuli and Arquata \u2014 to the great questions concerning migration and the worries that that phenomenon instils in the hearts of people, the questions it raises and the difficulties it presents. The future has therefore become more and more a place of doubt, of fear. Yet we need to choose the road of hope, the road of possibility, the road of opportunity.\nThe problems are not in fact theoretical problems that need to be tackled by an assembly of experts. These problems have a face: it is the face of Omran, the Syrian boy, shell-shocked, covered in blood, looking with his big eyes not so much at the photographer\u2019s lens as at the hearts of each one of us; it is the eyes of Nadia, the Yazidi girl whom I met yesterday, who escaped from the violence of Da\u2019esh and is today a courageous witness in a battle on behalf of human rights, of women\u2019s rights, of freedom.\nThey are challenges and threats for which borders no longer exist. They are in the hearts of our cities and sometimes on the outskirts of European cities, which have often forgotten the true sense of threats inside our borders rather than outside them. Every reference to what happened between Paris and Brussels is deliberate.\nI therefore wondered, in conveying the greetings of Italy, which voice from Rome I should bring to those issues. It would be nice, of course, to share with the Assembly the words of hope and also of pride that characterize the concrete acts of saving hundreds of thousands of human lives from the Mediterranean \u2014 lives otherwise condemned by desperation \u2014 by the Italian women and men wearing the uniform of the Navy or the Coast Guard.\nIt would be nice to bring to each member of the General Assembly the pride and the voice of the Italians who work in the fields of culture, education and research; of Italians who, together with other Europeans, are leading the European mission that in a few weeks will see for the first time a European spacecraft land on Mars, on 19 October, in exactly one month \u2014 a sign of the research that is making Europe not only a place of technocrats and bureaucrats, but also a place looking toward the future.\nYet I would like to propose a different, even provocative image. The image of Rome that I would like to propose is that of Aeneas. Aeneas is the man of the journey. Mythology is filled with examples of people who set out on journeys. Some set out on a journey to return home, like Odysseus. And some, like Aeneas, chose to journey to create a new city, a new civilization.\nAeneas sets out on a journey carrying on his shoulders his ailing father. It is a sign of a generation that is not afraid to assume its responsibilities and that believes that the experience of the elderly is still an absolute value and will go so far as to bear on its shoulders the added burden of history. Aeneas is the man who ensures for his son, Ascanius, the possibility of going on to live and to found the great history of Rome. But Aeneas is the man who, in the foundation myth, is the bearer of pietas, the sense of profound respect, halfway between the religious value and the profound sense of cultural identity that makes a community worthy of being called a community. Without pietas, without compassion for others, there is no room for community. And this is why, to my mind, it is essential that we tackle the challenge launched this morning from this rostrum by Barack Obama with the great value of pietas and the building of communities to which the myth of Aeneas refers.\nThis is how Italy will tackle the challenges of 2017: by participating in the Security Council, a responsibility that it will share with the Netherlands. It will participate in the Council, which will see a new Secretary-General, with the assumption of responsibility and the conviction that the Sustainable Development Goals, the challenges associated with environmental and technological sustainability and the building of an ever-stronger community will reflect the values that have made our history great. In 2017 Italy will participate in the life of the international community by hosting, on 25 March, the States members of the European Union for the sixtieth anniversary of the signing of the European Treaty, with the goal of making of Europe not merely an evocation of history but rather a new chapter in a book to be written with increased ideals, dreams, horizons and vision, not with a tiring and repetitive day-by-day listing of bureaucratic rules and decisions.\nItaly will lead the work of the Group of Seven (G- 7), which will meet at a splendid site in Sicily \u2014 that land of great culture and great values \u2014 by the Greek theatre in Taormina, facing Mount Etna with the Mediterranean Sea before it bathing the shores of that extraordinary region. The agenda will focus on the actions that we have been discussing today: increasing our contributions to development cooperation and investments in education. For we must not forget that, if the terrorist problem has its origins in theatres of war, there is also a terrorist problem originating in the abandoned outskirts of our cities, and the only weapon that can counter such terrorism is an enormous investment in education and human capital.\nWe are very proud that the Italian Government has adopted a law, with the support of representatives of Parliament, that stipulates that for every euro invested in security, policing, cybertechnology and cybersecurity, one euro must be invested in culture, education, recreation, preschool education, theatres and other venues that nurture the spirit and the soul, because that is another way to fight the crisis of our era.\nWe will ensure that the meeting of the G-7 serves as an important occasion to reflect on the values of identity and culture, as well as the challenge of food in the double sense of the fight against poverty and starvation, on the one hand, and the value of food security and health awareness, on the other. At the same time, we are convinced that the challenge facing the Security Council, the challenge facing Europe and the challenge facing the G-7 share the same root, based on the same blueprint.\nIt is our duty as Italians to bring our voice and our contribution to the United Nations in seeking and identifying ancient values with a new inflection. Today, the pietas of Aeneas has become an opportunity to build a new world based on hope and not on resentment, hatred or anger. Our people, our men and women, continue to work to serve the ideals of peace. They include our women and men in diplomacy and politics, and the women and men who serve our country by wearing a uniform in Afghanistan and in Somalia, by protecting the Mosul Dam in an area fundamental to the future of our planet, and by serving in the Balkans as well, in particular in Serbia. They are security professionals with additional features, namely, the priority they place on humanity.\nThe women and men who make us proud to be a part of the Italian heritage know that we have not originated from nothing, but rather from the tradition to which I have referred, one that finds its highest expression represented by the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean is the sea that the Romans called Mare Nostrum \u2014 our sea. It is the sea where today hundreds and thousands of people seek refuge as they flee from war, from hunger and from poverty. The responsibility for that part of the world has become our ever-growing burden.\nIn comparison, while we can say that progress has been made in Libya since last year, too little has been accomplished by the international community, particularly Europe, in transforming the Mediterranean Sea into a place where we meet the challenge of dignity. If we do not prioritize the values of humanity and pietas in that geographic area, in that corner of the world, we will have betrayed our tradition. That is why Italy accepts the challenge launched today by the President of the United States to the General Assembly by stating that we will always be on the side of democracy, freedom, values and ideals, with the determination that flows from those who have a great dream and a great vision, but also at the same time the deep desire to make politics into a noble and concrete activity, by intervening without leaving the responsibility for follow-up to others and by fully embracing the deeper meaning of the challenge that we, for our part, call humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to speak on behalf of the President of the Republic of Angola, His Excellency Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, in the General Assembly, which seeks to address and find solutions to the multidimensional challenges facing the world.\nThe General Assembly is indeed a privileged forum whose aim is to find solutions to the most pressing international problems, to preserve peace, to strengthen collective security and to help renounce the use of force in international relations, while respecting the sovereignty of States, the protection and promotion of human rights and the reaffirmation of the rule of law as fundamental principles of the international system.\nDuring the seven decades of existence of the United Nations, there have been transformations in all aspects of life, such as a radical change in the nature of conflicts, international terrorism at unspeakable levels and unprecedented climate change. Those changes naturally require joint reflection on the role and future of the United Nations. We need an Organization capable of promoting international peace and security, acting quickly and effectively in conflict situations and addressing the most pressing challenges of our time. If for no other reason, these issues should provide an incentive to accelerate reforms aimed at revitalizing the United Nations system, in particular the Security Council.\nIn fact, reforming the Council is not merely optional but an imperative, and failure to carry it out could hinder the ability of the United Nations to act, thereby eroding its legitimacy and credibility.\nThe Republic of Angola is in favour of increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council in order to make it more representative and better equipped in its ability to respond to conflicts. For this reason, we reaffirm the right of the African continent to be represented among the permanent members of Security Council, as stated in the Ezulwini Consensus. We believe that the spirit of openness to dialogue, tolerance and common sense is key to solving the problems that currently plague humankind.\nIn this context, the Republic of Angola, which currently holds the presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, has been engaged, in both the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council, in seeking bilateral and multilateral solutions to the problems affecting the region. In this regard, we reaffirm our determination to continue to support and promote dialogue, peace, security and stability in Central Africa and throughout the Great Lakes region of Africa.\nWe welcome the successful conclusion of the peace and electoral processes in the Central African Republic, which have enabled the country to start a new era. Their new era requires support from the international community in order to promote national reconstruction and consolidate the country\u2019s institutions.\nIn South Sudan, the completion of the dialogue represents an important step towards the establishment of peace and the formation of a government of national unity to resolve the crisis in that country. The parties should be encouraged to honour their commitments, and the international community should maintain its support for the peace process.\nWith regard to Burundi, we call for the intensification of the dialogue for peace and urge respect for the legally established authority in order to overcome the impasse created by the post-electoral conflict. It is important to promote good neighbourliness and mutual security along the border separating Burundi from the adjacent countries.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we encourage support for the electoral process in order to ensure peaceful and free elections, the preservation of peace and stability, the reconciliation process and the consolidation of democracy. In fact, peaceful elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are vital for peace, stability and development in the entire Great Lakes region of Africa. Both the United Nations and the African Union should devote special attention to the crises in Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Burundi.\nWe are facing a troubled international political environment that combines the escalation of conflicts \u2014 especially in the Middle East \u2014 with threats and constant episodes of violence that the international community has not been able to adequately address. Terrorism, a phenomenon that merits relentless combat, is the most extreme form of these threats. The world seems unprepared to deal with the ability of non-State groups and individuals eager to generate terror. The conflicts in Libya, Syria and Iraq in particular call for speedy resolution owing to their grave humanitarian repercussions.\nThe causes of those conflicts reside in the serious violations of the fundamental rights of the people involved and in foreign intervention, which has proved disastrous in its attempts to change the regime through the artificial imposition of supposed democracy, while the forced displacement of thousands of human beings that we see today constitutes a heartbreaking reality of human degradation and an offence against human dignity that demands an immediate and comprehensive response by the international community.\nWe recall that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected by all Member States in all processes being implemented in the United Nations system. For this reason, it is worth highlighting that the process of d\u00e9tente between Cuba and the United States of America continues to need support from the international community. We welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which we hope will translate to the lifting of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba.\nI would like to state that the Republic of Angola is firmly committed to implementing the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by adopting appropriate measures at the national level, to be implemented over the next 15 years, for the benefit of our people and our planet and to promote prosperity, stability and peace. To this end, Angola considers it important for all Member States to take a holistic, integrated and comprehensive approach in all sectors and at all levels in order to maintain the universal and inclusive nature of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nClimate change is one of the most complex and urgent issues of domestic and foreign policy that we face today because of its impact on migration, food security, natural resources, the spread of epidemics and even on social and economic instability. Thus the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a valuable, ambitious, balanced and fair tool for action whose entry into force will encourage collective efforts to control global warming.\nThe Republic of Angola emits only 0.17 per cent of all greenhouse gases. However, the effects of climate change are already being felt by us in many ways, such as the deterioration and shortening of cycles of drought and heavy rainfall, which pose a risk to agriculture and to economic and social infrastructures. Such effects also increase the incidence of various endemic diseases. It is therefore our intention to ratify the Paris Agreement as soon as possible as testimony to our unequivocal commitment and contribution to achieving its objectives. For similar reasons, we are motivated to participate in the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, which will be held in Quito in October. The Conference represents an opportunity for us to adopt a new global urban agenda to promote strong links and synergies among urbanization, sustainable development and climate change.\nThe Republic of Angola is committed to three cross- cutting processes it considers of crucial importance: women and peace and security, peacekeeping operations and peacebuilding architecture. We recognize the vital role of women and the importance of their participation in all stages and levels of the peace process.\nI would be remiss not to mention here that the Republic of Angola is a stable country from the perspectives of political and social conditions, and this has helped it to consolidate its unity, its national reconciliation process and its institutions. On the economic front, the challenges are greater today as a result of volatility in the prices of raw materials on the international market. But we continue to work to adjust our action plans, as well as to find pathways to economic growth and the improvement of the lives of our people.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at it seventy-first session and to assure him of Angola\u2019s firm support during his tenure. I wish to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his excellent work during the seventieth session. Let me also express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for dedicating his talent and wisdom to the service of the United Nations for the past 10 years and making a tangible contribution to international peace and security and to a safer world for present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "I am very pleased to address, for the first time, this global family of ours at its seventy-first gathering, on behalf of the Government and the people of Kiribati.\nI join previous speakers in congratulating President Peter Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I am particularly proud to see a Pacific brother leading this body during this critical period of transformation. I have every confidence that with his able leadership and Pacific wisdom, he will be able to guide us through these challenging times. He can be assured of our full support and cooperation.\nI also join colleagues in acknowledging with appreciation the commendable leadership of his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, in guiding our work during the seventieth session and in facilitating the implementation of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThis is a transitional period for us all. I am very happy that my first general debate coincides with the assumption of the Pacific to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am quite sad, though, that this is the last general debate of our beloved Secretary-General. I have read about and observed the untiring service that our Secretary-General has given humankind and his personal unwavering commitment and passion in focusing global attention on the most vulnerable, particularly the small and low-lying island countries as well as the communities on the front line of the many major challenges facing us today as a global family.\nI am so proud to say that Mr. Ban Ki-moon is the first Secretary-General to ever have visited my country and our part of the world in the Pacific in the 71 years of the existence of this premier global body. This is a very rare opportunity, and I would like to personally thank and commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for having taken that bold initiative. It is my sincere hope that the next visit of our Secretary-General to my country and the Pacific will be soon, not 60 or 70 years from now. This will be part of the transformation that we expect from our United Nations family.\nAllow me, on this note, to acknowledge and commend, with heartfelt gratitude, the sterling leadership of our Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. I thank and commend him for being a steadfast advocate for and the voice of the voiceless. I thank and commend him for instilling our United Nations family and reaffirming an inclusive culture that ensures that no one is left behind. The legacy he will leave is enshrined in the new sustainable development Agenda and in the Paris Agreement, the catalyst for global attention and action on climate change.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of Kiribati, I wish our Secretary-General the very best as he concludes his term as head of this global family of ours and as he takes on the next challenge in his unwavering service to humankind.\nWe meet at a very critical time in our history. The challenges facing us as we gather at this session are perhaps greater than when we met a year ago. We note with grave concern the increasing security challenges facing our global family, from conflicts around the world, the scourge of terrorism, transnational organized crime, war and nuclear testing, mass movements of refugees and migrants, to the often unstated but invisible silent killer, the non-communicable diseases, the health of our oceans and other looming challenges and uncertainties, some with incremental but very real existential threats such as climate change. These continue to undermine our efforts as a global family to achieve sustainable development.\nI would also like to add that the new session provides a great opportunity for all of us \u2014 an opportunity to reaffirm and renew our commitment to our people and our planet. This is an opportunity to achieve peace and prosperity for all through genuine partnerships, to consolidate our efforts and resources in order to address the challenges we face, and to realize our vision for bringing about an inclusive world. As leaders, it is our opportunity to deliver on our commitments. We have a moral responsibility to do that, and we must do so forthwith.\nThe theme of this session \u2014 \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d \u2014 is a timely and appropriate one. For if we are to address the challenges we face and realize the opportunities available to us, we must change our mindset, our path and our ways. And we must do this together.\nClimate change is a global challenge that requires universal transformation. We simply cannot afford to continue with business as usual. The future of those of us who are most vulnerable, such as my people and my country, is at stake. We need major changes in the global mindset, the global development pathways and the ways we do business. We must do this if we are to secure the future of my people and those who share the same fate, and to ensure that we are not left behind.\nEvery year, my country comes to this family gathering with constant cries for help in stopping the momentum of global warming and in assisting countries like mine to adapt to the adverse impact of climate change. It is distressing to see our people continuing to fight the effects of the onslaught of sea-level rises, storm surges and disasters such as Cyclone Pam and Cyclone Winston on their homes, farmland and livelihood, their heritage and their critical source of water. And I must say that the increasing frequency and severity of such events has exacerbated their heartbreaking impact on our people.\nIn some parts of our country, whole villages have had to be relocated because of severe coastal erosion and flooding. Food crops have been destroyed. Our freshwater lenses, our major source of drinking water, are being increasingly contaminated by intruding seawater. As we enter the La Ni\u00f1a period, with drought forecast for our country, water scarcity is already an issue for our people in both urban and rural areas, which has the potential to trigger other risks, for example, to sanitation, health and education. Kiribati is closely monitoring the situation and is seriously considering the immediate options for ensuring our people\u2019s survival.\nWe urgently call for assistance from our United Nations family and its members, asking them to look into their hearts and help us address this looming, life-threatening issue as soon as possible. This is an issue that cannot wait for the Paris Agreement ratification process to happen. I came here straight from a meeting of our Parliament that was held because my people, especially our younger generation, are unremittingly protesting the increasing intensity of the effects of climate change. They are demanding swift action right now, without procrastination.\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change last year gave humankind a sense of hope, embodying the global consensus that climate change is happening and must be resolved as soon as possible. It is a major first step in global action to counter climate change. The next challenge is to ensure the Agreement\u2019s early entry into force. In this regard, I am pleased to say that following our signing of the Paris Agreement in April, I had the honour yesterday of depositing my country\u2019s instrument of ratification during the high- level event for the entry into force of the Agreement. We are fully committed to the Agreement and to all climate-related undertakings aimed at ensuring that our global family addresses the root causes and impacts of climate change.\nThe suffering of our people must stop now. The Paris Agreement will not only help us address our challenges as a low-lying atoll nation already on the front line; it can also save others on the way to increasing vulnerability from ending up on the front\n18/46 16-29553 line in the future. I commend our bigger brothers in our global family, notably China and the United States, for their commitment to this process. I urge the rest of our United Nations family to join them and help save those who urgently require immediate support and action to make it happen. This is an opportunity for us as leaders to push for an early entry into force of the Paris Agreement and transform our world for our generation and, more importantly, for future generations.\nThis is an opportunity for us to take care of one another. And we must do it together, as a family. There is a huge risk of being left behind for low-lying island nations such as mine \u2014 Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, the Maldives and countless others whose peoples live in coastal areas prone to drought, desertification, flooding and typhoons.\nThe global challenges facing our people, especially the most vulnerable, continue to test our humanity, love and compassion, which are powerful ingredients for achieving the global transformation that can lead to the future we all want. If we fail to achieve this transformation, we will be failing the people who look to us for leadership in improving their quality of life and securing a future for them, their children and their children\u2019s children.\nThe President opened this session of the Assembly with his grandchildren by his side. It was a moving and significant moment, reminding all of us of our most important constituents, our children and their children. In his opening statement, he rightly said that it is our call to make, because if we fail, we have failed our grandchildren. As a leader and a grandfather, I am fully committed to serving and delivering to all the children and grandchildren of our global family.\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have not been developed in a vacuum. They have been reflected over the years in one form or another in our own development plans. It is therefore to the national level that we should direct implementation assistance, including with additional resources, capacity-building and technology transfers. That is where such assistance can make a big difference in improving our peoples\u2019 lives, especially at the grassroots level.\nIt will be a challenge if we have to continue to compete for resources within our multilateral agencies. On that note, I wish to acknowledge with deep appreciation the continuing assistance for our sustainable development efforts from our development partners. But implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require much more. The universal push to transform our world requires all of us to contribute. It requires a global effort.\nIt is troubling to note that for years, indeed decades, our global family has often ignored the support and instrumental role of those who have contributed to the implementation of our sustainable development goals. As some of us would acknowledge, Taiwan has served as a significant partner and contributed significantly to achieving the objectives of our global family. This must be acknowledged and the increased and meaningful participation of Taiwan in international processes should be encouraged. We need our global transformation to include those who can contribute to the effective implementation of the SDGs.\nI strongly believe that effective global transformation must start with leadership at the individual, community, Government and national levels. Good governance, transparency and accountability have been the fundamental guiding principles of my Government since our assumption of office over six months ago. They underpin our overarching policy objective to serve and to deliver to our people as responsible leaders.\nI am very proud to say that at our first meeting of Parliament, we established a select committee on anti-corruption. Just last week, the Government submitted draft legislation to our Parliament on a code of conduct for leaders. In addition, during the same week, our Parliament passed a constitutional amendment that established a new Ministry of Justice. This will lead to a strengthening of our justice system and elevate levels of transparency and accountability. We firmly believe that, as a Government, we can transform our nation for the better if our actions as leaders are underpinned by strong principles of good governance, transparency and accountability. This promotes our people\u2019s confidence and trust in their representatives.\nIf we are serious and genuine about the true transformation that we are talking about, then I challenge all of us, as leaders and representatives of our peoples, to ask ourselves this fundamental question: what is the greatest value and gift we have to give that can break the barriers between our peoples, our communities, our nations and our global family and truly transform our world? The answer is simple and the common denominator is also straightforward: it is our hearts and our love. This has been a missing ingredient in our recipe for global peace and security. Our biggest challenge here at the United Nations is that we have not been sharing our hearts and our love with each other. In fact, over the past 70 years, what we have been doing is fighting within our own family.\nI truly believe that the heart of our United Nations family is the heart of all nations, big and small, land-locked and sea-locked, rich and poor, the most vulnerable and the least vulnerable. The heart of the United Nations should therefore beat for everyone, not just a few. Just this morning, I had the gracious honour and privilege to join the Federation of World Peace and Love in ringing a bell for love and peace in the world with a special prayer for Kiribati. This is a reminder to the world, particularly to all of us leaders, of our fundamental role as peacemakers.\nWe are reminded every day of the very purpose of this United Nations family \u2014 to promote and maintain peace and security in all its forms. It is a major challenge but a challenge that I believe can be overcome if we start working together as a true United Nations family with love, care, compassion, understanding, respect and tolerance. This is a true global transformation that can help our United Nations family serve its members and deliver solutions and results.\nWe are called upon to take up the challenge of this United Nations family gathering and ask whether or not we can transform ourselves and make a difference in the name of love \u2014 a simple but powerful and inclusive four-letter word that resonates in the four corners of the world. As we contemplate this question, I would like to conclude by sharing a poem that represents our hope and identity \u2014 an identity that we will fight to save as long as we can. We need help in this fight so that a part of this global family does not get left behind or lose its liberty or identity. The title of the poem is \u201cMy Frigatebird\u201d.\n\u201cCloaked in black, white-bellied, and fork-tailed,\nyou are my beauty in the north. With your long and graceful wings, you are my\ninspiration in the centre. As you speed across the deep vast ocean, you are\nmy sanctuary in the south. With your clicking, wheezy calls, you are my song\nand my garland everywhere. On a banner of blue, white, yellow and red, you\nascend beyond the waves and the sun\u2019s rays. Now you struggle against storms and westerly\nwinds to find food and nesting.\nBut you will never leave in haste nor go in flight,\nfor you are the fulcrum of the universe. Arise, my frigate bird with valor and strength, rise\nover the perilous tides from the east and fly brave and proud on the currents of wind, for you are and will always be my transformation. Proud am I to be an I-Kiribati \u2014 my frigatebird,\nmy liberty, my identity.\u201d\nIn closing, I share with everyone in this Hall our hearts, our love and now our traditional blessing for health, peace and prosperity: \u201cTe Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te Tabomoa\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "We are living in times that show us the necessity of shifting our perspective with regard to addressing development. Our world is in the midst of a crisis that extends back years, and which, far from being resolved, has only worsened, generating criticism of political institutions that do not seem capable of representing their citizens. At the same time, economic growth has given way to a global slowdown and has not been able to provide the world\u2019s population with the well-being that it seeks.\nIt would appear that the far-reaching dynamics that caused the crisis some years ago were not superseded but merely superficially retouched. But citizens today are more aware and empowered. Thanks to new technology, they have new means of expression. They are showing us that in their daily lives, at their places of work, at their children\u2019s schools, in the health of their families, in the security of their cities, in the pensions of their mothers and fathers and in the relations between men and women, the negative effects of inequitable development are still being felt. This is the main basis for the citizen discontent that we have seen in various parts of the world.\nAt the same time, we are facing an unprecedented environmental crisis that threatens life on earth, has medical, clinical, economic, climatic and environmental impacts and mostly affects the most vulnerable. These are combined with violence and armed conflict in many parts of the world, which increase precariousness and exponentially expand forced displacement and major migratory movements.\nCitizen discontent is the expression of disillusionment about the promised development that they desire and for which they have fought valiantly but which is still beyond their reach. We are witnessing a growing schism between the representatives and the represented. There is a lack of trust in national Governments as well as in multilateral forums. They appear not to be tackling the priorities of the common citizen in a timely manner or with the required depth. Now is not the time for taking the easy but ultimately destructive route of populism. Now is the time for action inspired by an ethically motivated and civically oriented pragmatism.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals that we are committed to achieving by 2030 demonstrate that the international community knows that it must embark on far-reaching changes and implement them with concrete measures. Now we must summon up the political will in multilateral forums and in each of our countries. There is inertia to be overcome and there are interests to be dealt with. The political and development crisis that we are facing has global dynamics. Nobody, no nation or social group can do it alone. We need to engage in multilateral dialogues at the regional and global levels, assuming realistic but demanding commitments. I insist that we must act now. At home, the citizens are waiting for us, asking us to transmit their demands and return with decisions and determination. I hope that we can do that.\nChile is a mid-sized country that is not yet fully developed. However, its rapid modernization in recent decades has placed us squarely at the frontier of the challenges of modernity, with the tensions inherent in democracy and economic growth. I am speaking at this rostrum today having had this experience. I am also speaking from experience of having embarked on the changes requested by the citizens of my homeland. I know how difficult it is to make changes, but I also know the hope of seeing a new horizon gradually emerge. This is the course on which we have embarked as a nation, but also as a part of the international community.\nAt the regional and international levels, our country has advocated convergence in diversity in Latin America, seeking a common agenda that, despite our differences, gives us strength as a bloc and as a region. And we have made progress. We are working on integration with Mexico, Colombia and Peru in the Pacific Alliance, which already has 49 observer States and which is growing stronger decisively and pragmatically. Today, two integration mechanisms \u2014 the Pacific Alliance and the Southern Common Market \u2014 are aiming to promote a better Latin America, strengthening cooperation and making clear that national development and international relations cannot be seen as separate subjects.\nIn Latin America there are significant differences, but we are working together in spite of them to meet the new challenges. We are doing that within the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, where 33 member States are seeking to confront the new political, social and economic environment. In addition, within the Union of South American Nations, South American countries consult each other to address common political problems.\nOur nation\u2019s principles are immutable and include a call to peace, democracy and respect for human rights, respect for international law and the treaties, sovereignty and the obligation to cooperate. The promotion and protection of democracy and human rights at the international level are not contrary to the principle of non-intervention. In fact, today that is a global achievement.\nI believe that Colombia has given us one of the greatest pieces of news this year. At the regional and international levels, there is hope for peace. Next Monday, the agreement to end the hostilities of a civil war that has been raging for more than 50 years will be signed. Chile, a country that also had a difficult transition to democracy, would like to continue supporting its Latin American brother in handling its post-conflict situation, including with military and police observers in the United Nations political mission, working with it in solidarity as we have done in other brother countries such as Haiti.\nWe have committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. Similarly, we signed the Paris Agreement \u2014 the most ambitious and robust agreement in the history of multilateral negotiations on climate change. Together with Monaco and France, we proposed the Because the Ocean Declaration to stress the need to pay special attention to the way in which environmental degradation affects ocean waters. It has been signed by more than 30 countries.\nProtecting the oceans is vital for our common future, and today they are under threat. Chile has therefore decided to take action by creating the Nazca- Desventuradas Marine Park, which is the largest of its kind in Latin America. We are also engaged in a South- South cooperation project to assist Caribbean countries in combating marine pollution.\nOutside of this building and in the most diverse corners of the world, people, their leaders, civil society and the media are expecting the States Members of this Organization to provide cooperative, creative and tangible responses to the problems of the twenty-first century. That is why I raise my voice again in favour of Security Council reform to reflect today\u2019s new realities. I raise my voice in favour of an effective management of the United Nations and greater openness in its procedures, including the election of its new Secretary-General. I ask him or her to be committed to the principles that serve the people who founded the Organization. We know that successfully meeting challenges requires joint, consensual efforts. We need more multilateralism, cooperation and dialogue. This is an irreplaceable forum for debate and adoption of agreements. It is a platform for coordinated action.\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nChile is a country open to the world, which promotes clear-cut rules and political and economic agreements in order to move forward. The United Nations must play its role as a place of consensus in opposition to inequality and the discrimination against religious, ethnic and gender minorities, a place to which the most vulnerable may turn. Let us make the United Nations the Organization that our peoples need and call for.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to echo the sentiments of the many Heads of State, Government and delegation before me in congratulating Mr. Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We are particularly humbled, yet proud, that a son of Fiji, indeed a son of our Pacific islands, has reached the historic milestone of being chosen by the Member States of this institution to be their President. He can expect the full cooperation and support of the delegation of the Kingdom of Tonga. May I also add my voice to the cause of previous speakers in thanking his immediate predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his outstanding leadership of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\nWe welcome the President\u2019s timely and relevant choice of theme for this session. The focus of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 and of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development itself \u2014 is, as the theme aptly states, to transform our world and to ensure that no one is left behind. As we delve deeper into the implementation of the Agenda over the next years towards 2030, the transformation of our world, in line with the SDGs, can be accomplished, as the theme states, only through a universal push. That means that all countries and all actors must work together at national, regional and international levels in order to successfully implement the Agenda and achieve our targets.\nAn important gauge of that success is the extent of a country\u2019s internalization of the lofty Goals and targets that have been set. In November 2015, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Tonga began incorporating the SDGs in its domestic legislation by aligning its national strategic development framework with them. The SDGs are now an integral part of the Government\u2019s corporate-planning and budgeting clauses.\nThe health of our people is a top priority for Tonga. Indeed, we risk losing the most important natural resource that Tonga has to develop our country if the people fall prey to the dangers of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In recognition thereof, and in partnership with the Pacific Community and the World Health Organization, Tonga hosted the first regional summit on non-commuicable diseases in June of this year in order to highlight the rampant spread of these diseases throughout the Kingdom and the Pacific island region and to consider action to address the regional NCD crisis. We were privileged to have as a guest of honour UNDP Administrator Helen Clark, whose attendance at the summit was a first for her in her current role, and which indicated the importance that the UNDP, in partnership with Tonga and the region, attaches to that health topic. As one of the leading countries highlighted by the NCDs Joint Programming Missions programme and the United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, at a side event this week, Tonga was recognized at the international level for its integrated national efforts to address NCDs.\nRelated to the important issue of health is the onslaught of transnational crime in our country. With porous borders, drugs have managed to enter Tonga through the illicit movement of people and goods. Although our country is very small in terms of capital in comparison with our neighbouring countries, Tonga has seen the effect of the drugs trade on the health and well-being of our people, particularly our young people, which is putting the future of our country at risk. We support the regional initiatives of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to combat the trafficking in drugs and precursors, among other things, and organized crime in the Pacific.\nAs a small island developing State \u2014 in other words, a sea-locked developing country \u2014 our traditional and modern relationship with the ocean places the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its natural resources at the forefront of our interests. Tonga joined the ranks of Member States that argued for the importance of the ocean and seas to global sustainable development and gradually steered the negotiations on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to the inclusion of SDG 14, on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources in the Agenda.\nWe are now greatly committed to ensuring that SDG 14, together with its set targets and indicators, is achieved by 2030. We therefore very much look forward to the first United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, to be held in June 2017, as the first global meeting to take stock of where we stand in terms of the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans and its resources and where we need to go to ensure that all targets are achieved. We thank our friends Fiji and Sweden for paving the way for the holding of that international conference. The Assembly can rest assured that Tonga will be highly engaged in that process.\nWe also commend Italy for its 10x20 Initiative in line with SDG target 14.5, which seeks to set aside 10 per cent of our coastal waters as marine protected areas by 2020. We look forward to engaging with and supporting the work of the Steering Committee in that regard, under the able guidance of the co-Chairs, Italy and Maldives.\nTonga continues to recognize the importance of the work of the International Seabed Authority (ISA). Tonga engages in the Authority\u2019s processes to ensure that the appropriate conservation and environmental-management practices are sufficiently robust in terms of seabed mining. We thank the Member States that supported Tonga in its election to the Council of the Authority in 2014 and, earlier this year, to the Council\u2019s Legal and Technical Commission. In reiterating our support for the good work of the ISA Assembly, we look forward to assisting the Authority in managing the upcoming challenges as the onset of seabed mining in the Area comes to the fore. We also congratulate the ISA Secretary-General-elect, Mr. Michael Lodge, and look forward to his stewardship of the Authority in the coming years.\nThe regulation of the exportation of biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions has yet to be realized. In line with the decision of the leaders of the Pacific Island Forum in 2014, we strongly support the ongoing Preparatory Committee meetings process established under the resolution 69/292, of 19 June 2015, which will make substantive recommendations at the seventy-second session of the General Assembly for a legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nWe commend the leadership of the Chairperson of the Preparatory Committee, Ambassador Eden Charles of Trinidad and Tobago, and look forward to his continued stewardship and skilful guidance of the process towards its completion through the final two Preparatory Committee meetings next year. The draft agreement recognizes the value and importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity.\nBy partnering with friends, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Tonga is able to face the challenges of climate change, while remaining fully aware that as a Government it cannot face such challenges alone. One of those challenges is the existential threat posed by climate change to international peace and security. To ensure that the issue of negative impacts of climate change is high on the United Nations agenda, we reiterate our call for a Special Representative on climate and security and for the issue to be raised by our friends in the Security Council, due to its clear and unambiguous links to additional threats to international peace and security. Be it in terms of sea-level rise, loss of territory, mass migration or as an instigator of violence and the suffering of peoples as a result of the scarcity of resources, the causal link is clear.\nTonga is the third-most-vulnerable country in the world to the adverse impacts of climate change. As a signatory party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its subsequent Protocol, Tonga affirms its ongoing commitment to implementing the objectives of this core international framework on climate change. The seriousness of the negative impacts of climate change cannot be underestimated. Its impacts threaten our territorial integrity, land, water, health, infrastructure, food security, biological diversity, livelihoods and ecosystems.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security is determined not solely, but in a major way, by the issue of disarmament. The proliferation of weapons in all their forms not only threatens international peace and security, it also demonstrates the sheer waste of financial resources when Governments invest in the manufacture and trade in arms. Such finances could be better used for international sustainable development initiatives, which would logically contribute to international peace and security and the betterment of lives. The spending of trillions of dollars in defence budgets to develop weapons, including nuclear weapons, at the expense of the welfare of one\u2019s people, is offensive and repugnant to the conscience of humankind.\nIn keeping with that sentiment, we wish to express our concern about the recent nuclear testing by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in breach of decisions made by the United Nations to promote international peace and security. Our Pacific islands and region having experienced the negative effects of nuclear testing, Tonga believes in the need for international standards to control and manage the use of nuclear capabilities and nuclear power for peaceful purposes. For its part, Tonga is at the final stage of its acceptance process of the statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will formalize its membership of the organization. We hope to deposit our instrument of acceptance with the Agency by the end of this month.\nPart of the challenge of ensuring the credible development of all States lies in preventing one country from dominating another country economically. This matter bears directly on the right to development, an issue that we discussed last Thursday morning at the high-level segment to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development. The unfair application of such dominance results in the suffering of innocent people and, in the light of political reasoning, should not be tolerated in this day and age. We therefore join many others in congratulating the Government of the United State on incrementally easing its restrictions on economic activity in Cuba. Tonga has an interest in that, given our concern for the welfare of our nationals currently living and studying in Cuba, and also for the millions of people who merely want an opportunity to enjoy the right to development. We will again join the majority of States represented here this year in calling on the United States for a timely lifting of its embargo on Cuba.\nWe want to address the welfare of the Pacific people who are residents and citizens of West Papua province, Indonesia. Last year, standing on this same rostrum (see A/70/PV.18), I spoke about the human rights abuses taking place in Indonesian-ruled West Papua. Nothing appears to have changed there in the year that has elapsed. I use the word \u201cappears\u201d intentionally, because we still have no way of knowing exactly what is going on there. It seems that something is definitely wrong.\nNearly half a century ago, when I was still young, I learned, as had many others in the region, that a wrong had been done to the West Papuans. I am not a young man now. During much of my life I have struggled,, against great odds for justice and democracy in my land. In the Christian faith, a universal truism is espoused through the story of the Good Samaritan. A badly injured man lay in the sun by the roadside. He had been stripped of his clothing and was evidently the victim of a robbery. Without any reservation or hesitation, free from religious and cultural restrictions or bias, the Good Samaritan went to help the man, relieve his suffering, clothe him and nurse him back to health. The man was placed by the Good Samaritan in local accommodation where he could recover.\nThe Tongolese probably have the same neighbourly concern for the welfare of the indigenous people of West Papua. As called for by a decision taken at a meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum earlier this month in the Federated States of Micronesia, Tonga supports the goal for an open and constructive dialogue with Indonesia with regard to the status and welfare of the people of West Papua. Tonga therefore calls on Indonesia, as a dialogue partner of the Pacific Islands Forum, to work with it and other Forum countries to facilitate this decision of our fellow leaders, either bilaterally or through United Nations mechanisms.\nFinally, we reiterate our support for the President and his presidency. We also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless work on behalf of all countries and peoples, and more especially for his sensitivity to the interests of small island developing States like my own, for which he has promoted specific initiatives. His presence here will surely be missed. We hope that his successor will carry forward his work on behalf of small island developing States. We wish him well in his future endeavours."

        "file_text": "In 1981, today\u2019s date, 21 September, was proclaimed as the International Day of Peace to promote a negotiated solution to armed conflicts throughout the world. Since 1982, one year later, Colombia has been on a long and difficult road to leave violence behind and attain peace. My predecessors pursued peace for Colombians, each in his own way. This is a task that I undertook on the first day of my Government in August 2010.\nI have come to speak to members of the Assembly on seven occasions on the progress and expectations of the peace process between the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group \u2014 the largest and oldest such group on the American continent. A year ago, standing here before the Assembly (see A/70/PV.16), I said that I expected to return in 2016 as the President of a Colombia in peace \u2014 a reconciled Colombia.\nAfter more than half a century of internal armed conflict, I return to the United Nations today, on the International Day of Peace, to announce, with all the strength of my voice and heart, that the war in Colombia has ended. On 24 August in Havana, the negotiators declared that all provisions were complete and adopted the final text of the General Agreement for the Termination of the Conflict and the Construction of a Stable and Lasting Peace. Five days later, a bilateral and definitive ceasefire and cessation of hostilities took place. As a result, since then there has not been a single death, a single wound or a single bullet fired in the conflict with FARC.\nThe Agreement will be officially signed in Cartagena de Indias on 26 September. The people of Colombia will approve it through a plebiscite on 2 October. From that moment forward, the former members of the guerrilla group will go to different cantonment areas to begin surrendering their arms to the United Nations within a six-month period, and to begin their reintegration into society.\nTheir weapons will be melted and will be made into three monuments to peace \u2014 one here in New York; one in Cuba, where the peace negotiations took place; and another one in Colombia. These monuments will remind us that the bullets are behind us and that the construction of a new and better country has begun. Joyfully, I reiterate that the last and oldest armed conflict in the western hemisphere has come to an end. The Americas \u2014 the two vast American continents with all of their islands, from Patagonia to Alaska \u2014 are now a region of peace.\nThe Agreement that was reached after almost six years of public conversations is the best news for Colombia, Latin America and the world. What does the Agreement mean? Above all, it means that FARC will cease to exist as an armed group and reintegrate into society, and can become a political movement within our democracy. We have agreed on measures to guarantee its political participation, offer more assurances to the opposition and strengthen democracy and the electoral system in Colombia.\nWe have also outlined programmes to improve the quality of life of rural inhabitants, who have been the most affected by the conflict, and to make land available to those who do not have it or who lost it because of the war. A central aspect of this peace process is that it has focused on the protection and guarantee of the rights of the victims: the rights to truth, justice, reparations and non-repetition. To that end, we have agreed on such mechanisms as a truth commission, reparation and restoration measures, and a comprehensive transitional justice system.\nThis is the first time in the history of the resolution of armed conflicts anywhere in the world that a Government and an illegal armed group \u2014 through an agreement and not through external imposition \u2014 have agreed on transitional justice. The perpetrators of international crimes and other serious crimes will be investigated, judged and punished. This has been positively highlighted by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and many other organizations and experts. We are sure that this model of justice, which is framed within a comprehensive system to guarantee the rights of the victims \u2014 as established by the Rome Statute \u2014 will be a useful precedent for future peace processes.\nI should like to highlight another aspect of the Agreement. We know that drug trafficking has fueled war in Colombia and around the world. Thanks to the Agreement, FARC is committed to severing all ties with this activity and to cooperating, through concrete actions, to combat this phenomenon. This is highly symbolic, as those who once protected illicit coca crops will now work with the State in eradicating them.\nA similar process will be take place with regard to the anti-personnel mines that have killed and mutilated so many soldiers, police officers, farmers and children. The State and FARC will work jointly to demine all of the national territory. That will also have significant environmental benefits not only for our country, but also for the planet. To the extent that illegal crops are replaced with legal ones, the deforestation caused by coca cultivation will stop. No longer will millions of barrels of oil spill into our rivers and oceans because of attacks on our oil infrastructure. We will be able to better take care of and preserve the natural lung that is the Amazon.\nA new Colombia greets the international community today. It is a Colombia full of hope, a Colombia that, without war, is ready to reach its highest potential and to be a positive factor in the global context. It is a Colombia where the resources that used to finance war will now be better used on education, health and security for its citizens. It is a Colombia that opens its arms to the world and welcomes investment, trade and tourism.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals have already been adopted into law in our country. We were the first country to do so. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is now before Congress to be enacted into law. Peace will undoubtedly allow us to achieve these transformative commitments with greater ease and effectiveness.\nToday, on behalf of almost 50 million Colombians, I express our deepest gratitude to the international community for its ongoing and tireless support for peace in Colombia. We thank Cuba, the host of the dialogues, and Norway, which were guarantors of the peace negotiations, as well as Chile and Venezuela, which accompanied the entire process. I thank the United States, Germany and the European Union, which appointed special envoys to accompany the dialogues.\nWe especially thank the United Nations, Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council, which established a political mission to lead the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire and the disarmament of the guerrillas. I had the opportunity to thank the Council personally a few moments ago (see S/PV.7773). We thank the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, all of which supported this process. We are profoundly grateful to so many Governments, countries and organizations that have continuously expressed their solidarity and willingness to support Colombia in the challenging post-conflict phase that lies ahead of us.\nI can say today, in this historic Hall, that we have succeeded for Colombians and the world. Colombia is turning the page of war to start writing the chapter of peace. That is what we wish for the rest of the planet.\nTherefore, we offer our full solidarity to the nations that have suffered and continue to suffer from the scourge of global terrorism. The example of Colombia should give hope to the world that it is possible to achieve the dream of peace when there is will and commitment. To that end we must first disarm spirits and language, because words can be as harmful as bombs. We have to take in and protect the victims and the most vulnerable, including the thousands of human beings that flee war to seek opportunities beyond their borders. Colombia is more than ready to continue supporting the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations \u2014 the search for peace in the world.\nAs President of Colombians, I am happy and humbly excited to announce to the Assembly the peace in Colombia. A conflict of over half a century \u2014 a conflict that left more than 220,000 people dead and claimed more than 8 million victims \u2014 has come to an end. The bells of peace are ringing in Colombia and their echo is heard by all the nations represented in this Hall. We do not want more war. We do not want more wars, not in Colombia and not in the rest of the world. Today we have a reason for hope. There is one less war on the planet, and that is the war in Colombia.\n"

        "file_text": "For far too many people, the world has become an unsafe place. The challenges confronting us seem immense, and at times it seems all but hopeless to find solutions to the many conflicts around us. However, all of us here, as politicians, have a choice. The choice is between resignation and engagement in those crises, between isolation and multilateral cooperation, and between national navel-gazing and shared responsibility for one another.\nWe have the choice. Do we relinquish the civilizational progress achieved by the founding generation of the United Nations after experiencing two world wars and turn back to the nineteenth century? Do we return to the era of fragile, purpose-oriented power alliances and power struggles among nation States? Or do we move forward and work together to master the challenges of the twenty-first century, whether they be migration, climate change or terrorism?\nIn light of the dramatic meetings on Syria this week, I would like to add that we can also choose whether to put our faith in the power of diplomacy, or to shrug our shoulders in resignation at the many conflicts around us \u2014 Syria, Libya, Yemen and eastern Ukraine. Do we give up and allow those conflicts to escalate even further? Or do we live up to our responsibility and continue working on solutions despite all the setbacks? We have the choice.\nIn Europe, too, we are faced with a choice, now that the United Kingdom has made its choice and has opted to leave the European Union. Do we now fight to hold Europe together? Or do we allow that wonderful peace and social project to fall apart again, or even allow populists to drive us apart? We have the choice.\nIn Asia, too, where new Powers are jostling for influence, there is also a choice. Do they believe that their future will depend solely on their own strength? Or does the key to a bright future and cooperative security lie in their involvement in the international order? Our Asian partners have the choice.\nThe United States is also faced with a choice, in six weeks\u2019 time. There, too, the choice is about a supposedly possible withdrawal from a crisis-ridden world, which some are calling for, or cooperation with international partners to solve the world\u2019s problems. That choice is important for all of us. The choice before us is withdrawal, resignation and going it alone, or shared responsibility for a better future.\nWhether we succeed in finding durable solutions to the major pressing challenges we face depends on the decision we make on that choice. I am talking in particular now about the Syrian crisis and the issue of refugees and migration. However, far beyond acute crisis management, that also presents us with a choice on which direction our world takes, and in what kind of international order we will live together in the future.\nThe objective and focus of German foreign policy are clear \u2014 we want to shape a just and peaceful world, and we want to shape it together with all partners who share that goal. The United Nations is and will remain our central forum for that. In the context of all the crisis meetings, it gives me hope that we, here in the United Nations, have made an important choice about the direction we want to take, that is, the right choice.\nOur choice has also been for unity, sustainability and transformation with the document that we adopted last year: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda is a global compact on the world\u2019s future, the focal point, the point of convergence for our joint actions. Our policies should be based on human rights, the rule of law and the fight against poverty and discrimination. We will also put global justice on the agenda of the Group of 20 when we assume the chairmanship in 2017.\nI wish to express our thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who initiated the 2030 Agenda. We would also like to thank him for his commitment to the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which the German Parliament ratified earlier this week. Where if not here, at the United Nations, could we demonstrate that, solely through cooperation, we can move forward towards justice and sustainability, towards peace and security. The Charter of the United Nations and international law provide the foundation for that.\nNorth Korea has, in a blatant manner, repeatedly violated central principles of international law. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the latest nuclear test carried out by North Korea. We cannot accept any country jeopardizing security in that region.\nThe United Nations provides the tools we need for our work here in New York and in crisis-stricken regions. In Libya and Yemen, we are supporting the tireless efforts of the Special Envoys of the Secretary- General to find political solutions. In Syria, it is clear that without the dedicated work of the United Nations and its experts, there would be even more suffering today and there would be even less hope for a solution. The hope raised a week ago by the ceasefire has again vanished, following the deadly, cynical and despicable attack on humanitarian aid workers a few days ago.\nToday the situation could not be more serious. We are again faced with the choice. Will we succeed in taking the first step towards a ceasefire, which would finally make humanitarian access possible so that people can receive what they need to survive? To that end, I have proposed an agreement on banning military flights during a period of several days. Al-Assad\u2019s Air Force must cease its attacks. I believe that Moscow also has a responsibility to help bring that about. If we do not succeed, then all efforts to find a political solution to Syria will be lost in a hail of bombs. For that reason alone, although unsuccessful yesterday, our efforts in the International Syria Support Group for a ceasefire must continue.\nWhile the international community works hard in New York to bring about a ceasefire, Al-Assad continues to bomb Aleppo to bits, which again demonstrates that the Al-Assad regime cannot and must not be allowed to determine Syria\u2019s future. However, we also cannot allow the conflict to be used by nearby or distant Powers to redraw the political and ethnic map of the Middle East. Syria\u2019s external borders must remain, and we should not allow new internal borders to be defined. The parties in the country and the region can, and indeed should, declare their legitimate interests. However, a fair balance of those interests must be found. Insisting on one of the many absolute truths will not bring peace any closer. I reiterate and want to be quite clear: there will be no winners in that war.\nIn the face of such suffering, we have an obligation to try right now to alleviate the plight of the Syrian people. Currently, Germany is one of the biggest donors of humanitarian aid. To date, we have made available approximately $2.5 billion for Syria and its neighbours. We have been particularly active in helping to stabilize areas in Iraq that have been liberated from the Islamic State. In Tikrit, we joined forces with United Nations agencies to rebuild schools and wells, so that as many as 90 per cent of those who have fled could return. In Ramadi, we are concentrating on unexploded mine clearance. In the case of Mosul, we are currently preparing to help local forces to begin rebuilding the city, which we hope will be liberated soon. At the same time, we are promoting access to education and the labour market in the countries neighbouring Syria \u2014 Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon \u2014 so that the people can have a future in their own region.\nIn 2015 in Germany, we welcomed and gave shelter to more than 1 million people. We have begun training refugees so that they acquire the skills needed to rebuild their cities. The objective is to ensure that the belief in a future at home does not remain a mere hope but can become a reality.\nOur response to refugee movements and migration must be a joint, global task in full awareness of the future. Clearly, the challenge will become even bigger if conflicts, hardship and poverty persist. That is why we must tackle the root causes together. Moreover, we must improve the architectural framework of international efforts designed to deal with refugee movements and migration. As co-Chair, along with Morocco, of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, we want to play our part during the next two years. Through the Berlin Round Table on Refugees and Migration, we are focusing on improving the structures of humanitarian assistance.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, held on 19 September, took important decisions on still more joint actions. We wish to convey our thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and United States President Barack Obama for hosting the 20 September Leaders\u2019 Summit on Refugees, alongside co-hosts Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico and Sweden.\nWe also need to revitalize engagement and cooperation in Europe as well. New rifts have emerged on our continent following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, in violation of international law and the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The security situation has changed, and we need to react. First, we need to strengthen our readiness to defend ourselves. At the same time, we must also be engaged. Together with France, Russia and Ukraine, we have been working tirelessly in the Normandy format on a political solution to the Ukraine conflict. Progress has finally been achieved with the Trilateral Contact Group\u2019s framework resolution on the disengagement of forces, which was ratified this week. A ceasefire is not all that is needed for the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, but we cannot make any political headway if the weapons are not silenced.\nHowever, there is much more at stake. We must be aware that genuine and lasting security in Europe can only take the form of cooperative security. That is why, as I have proposed, we must pay more attention to arms control in Europe. Such efforts are not meant to substitute for obligations not yet met. Rather, I have in mind new challenges, new technologies and new threats, many of which have not even been mentioned in existing documents. Our goal is to enable security for everyone.\nAs we seek to strengthen the dialogue between East and West, especially in these difficult times, we have assumed the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) this year. It is, by the way, the sole organization in which East and West continue to work together on a regular basis. We need the United Nations, as well as regional institutions such as the African Union and the OSCE, in order to ensure that diverging interests and differences of opinion do not turn into lasting alienation, thereby preparing the ground for even more new conflicts.\nOur own history reminds us Germans that we must do everything we can to overcome the rifts in Europe. When Willy Brandt, then Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, spoke in the General Assembly on 26 September 1973, after the flags of the two parts of Germany had been hoisted in front of this building, he said:\n\u201cIn a world in which we are all increasingly dependent on each other, a policy for peace must not stop at our own doorstep.\u201d (A/PV.2128, para. 33)\nThis is all the more true today in our interconnected world than it was back then. And it is all the more true for a large and prosperous country that our partners, rightly, perceive should play a role commensurate to its size and capabilities. It is for that reason that Germany is applying for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2019-2020 term. Peace, justice, innovation and partnership \u2014 those are our goals. They are the leitmotif of our candidature. and we will be guided by them.\nDespite crises and conflicts, I still firmly believe that the future lies in our hands. We will make the world a better place if we assume responsibility together \u2014 not against but with one another and, above all, if we work for those who follow us as the next generation. We have the choice. But we have to decide!\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session, and by wishing you the greatest success in discharging your new duties. It is with great satisfaction that Timor-Leste, a half-island nation in the Pacific, welcomes a representative from another Pacific island to preside over the General Assembly. I am certain that you, Sir, are well aware of the challenges that we face with regard to climate change and the management of our seas and marine resources. I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for all of his work and his\nunparalleled efforts to revitalize the General Assembly by increasing its effectiveness and efficiency and by strengthening its role as it carries out the duties set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, as well as his commitment to a transparent selection process of the next Secretary-General.\nIn the light of the fact that this is his last general debate, I would also like to express, on behalf of Timor- Leste, our deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the support Timor-Leste has received during his 10 years in office. His legacy has established the foundations for a reform of the bureaucracy and peacekeeping operations, and he has driven efforts to place human rights, climate change and refugees and migrants at the forefront of the Organization\u2019s agenda. As a symbol of the ideals of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon has worked to make the world safer for women and young people, promoted sustainable development actively and fortified the role of prevention.\nBased on our accumulated experience and the recommendations included in reports on peacekeeping operations, on the peacebuilding architecture and on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, this is an opportune moment for change. Promoting intergovernmental coherence and strengthening the Peacebuilding Commission and the partnerships needed for its maintenance are recommendations that will improve the United Nations system. Our efforts to respond to the challenges facing our nations and our peoples need to be more effective.\nWe continue to be confronted with situations of inequality and conflict that threaten our collective stability. We all know \u2014 and Timor-Leste has first- hand experience in the matter \u2014 that the United Nations is essential to ensuring the security of peoples and countries throughout the world. We therefore reiterate our belief in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and in a multilateral and international system, as we are aware of the fact that the world has a continuing need to maintain international peace and security, establish friendly relations among countries, work in cooperation to find solutions to global problems and foster respect for human rights.\nSuch goals can be achieved only if countries actively seek solutions to the problems they face. Such a belief is confirmed by the results that Timor-Leste has achieved. Using the lessons that we have learned, we wish to contribute to the dreams and hopes of other countries. Through the Group of Seven Plus and based on the principles of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, we are sharing our experiences and knowledge with a group of 20 fragile States affected by conflict.\nRegional integration generates opportunities for the economic development and well-being of a population and also contributes to peace and stability in countries and regions. For that reason, we aspire to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, so that we can have an opportunity to fulfil both the dreams of our people and our responsibility to form an integral part of civilization. It is that same principle that drove Timor- Leste, both as a member and during its presidency of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, to propose the concept of economic potential within the transregional constellation, which includes Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia, for debate among its member States.\nTo that end, and in order to promote development and the resulting improvement in the living conditions of its people, we appeal to the United States of America to urgently remove its trade, financial, and economic embargoes against the Republic of Cuba.\nWe are well aware that peace and development are intrinsically linked, which is a concept that we were determined to include in Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted one year ago. There must be no doubt of the fact that without peace and stability, we cannot envisage development, and vice versa. The new Goals are for all countries, so that all may benefit from sustainable development.\nLast year, in addition to being one of the first countries in the world to subscribe to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Timor-Leste joined a group of eight countries that wish to serve as models for the implementation of the Agenda by pooling best practices and experience.Over the past year, we have established an interministerial working group that, in collaboration with civil-society organizations and our development partners, has mapped indicators for the 17 Goals to transform our world and selected 20 targets that will enable us to monitor their implementation on the basis of quantitative results.\nWe have endeavoured to raise our partners\u2019 awareness of the importance of harmonizing our agendas and of the need for financial aid in order to achieve results. We are also planning a high-level international conference in March 2017 to discuss ways to advance the 2030 Agenda under very difficult circumstances. We have improved our commitment to show our young people, the future generation, how important their role is in achieving those Goals, to which we all must contribute and from which we will all benefit. Such an exercise is not easy, yet our Government has attempted to be mindful of the Goals in its budget and in activity- planning.\nWe have also developed additional plans and have included the SDGs in the review of Timor-Leste\u2019s strategic development plan for the period 2011-2030. We want the plan\u2019s impact on our population to be real and to benefit every citizen, whether old or young, from the city or the remotest village, in the short, medium, and long term. Our experience has already shown that we can achieve an impact, for example in the health sector. Health is our most precious asset, and we want to offer quality health care that benefits and impacts our population.\nIt gives me great satisfaction to share with the Assembly the fact that Timor-Leste \u2014 according to a study of 188 countries published in the 21 September issue of the British medical journal The Lancet \u2014- is the country that has attained the most progress towards achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals since 2000, as a result of the country\u2019s peaceful and stable environment and its efforts to broaden access to health care. We have also joined the antibiotic- resistance campaign. Concerted action among our countries will help to reduce the number of cases of resistance and increase the number of lives saved, both human and animal, thanks to the appropriate administration of medications.\nThe world must place fellow human beings\u2019 physical and moral well-being and human dignity above all other interests. The situation of refugees and migrants remains unresolved and deserves our focused attention and support. There is a continuing need for a joint solution to end that situation affecting thousands of people, including children. We still need to establish frank political dialogue and international partnerships to ensure respect for human rights and enable humanitarian assistance.\nOther major scourges persist in afflicting the world. The conflicts in Syria, South Sudan and Yemen, among others, are far from being resolved. We hope that the recent ceasefire in Syria may be a step on the path to peace and that conditions may be created for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those who most depend on it for their survival.\nWe also urgently need to find a solution together that would ensure the right to self-determination for the Saharawi people, as well as a just solution for the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, which must be respected.\nAs a country that has experienced conflict, Timor- Leste knows all too well the high price of war and how we must do everything to avoid it, through preventive diplomacy and by strengthening the institutions of the State. In addition to contributing to the Group of Seven Plus, we are willing, as we have done in the past, to be among those who contribute contingents to peacekeeping operations and thereby demonstrate our gratitude to the international community. Timor-Leste\u2019s past and present can serve as an example and a source of hope; after it emerged from conflict, Timor-Leste became a peaceful country that now enjoys security and stability and whose people can benefit from the dividends of peace.\nEven when countries emerge from conflict situations, there may remain issues of security that continue to threaten nations. Acts of terrorism, organized crime and threats to peace and stability have been constant and rather worrisome. The fight against terrorism and all those drivers of instability in the world and our societies require a commitment from all of us to work together towards a lasting solution.\nBy ratifying the relevant conventions, Timor-Leste has strengthened its commitment to contributing to the fight against terrorism and organized crime related to the financing of those activities. Money-laundering and illicit financial flows linked to terrorism are intimately connected with organized crime, and we are aware of the importance of simultaneously fighting piracy and the trafficking in drugs, persons and arms.\nSuch crimes are sometimes committed at sea or through maritime activities. In order to combat them and safeguard our economic potential, we must also protect our borders and ensure maritime security. We are a maritime nation, and for us the sea is highly and strategically important. To explore the potential that living and non-living maritime resources offer is to give ourselves the opportunity to diversify our economy through fishing activities, the development of tourism and the development of non-living resources. That requires sustainable development, which is doubly beneficial, not just for humankind but also for the environment. We appreciate the efforts of Fiji and Sweden in organizing the high-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 on oceans, to be held in New York in June 2017.\nAll countries across the globe must take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Island nations such as Timor-Leste are truly affected by the challenges brought about by climate change. Given our commitment to combat global warming and not to compromise biodiversity and marine ecosystems, in April we signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which is currently in the process of being ratified in our National Parliament.\nIn addition to that global concern, Timor-Leste also faces the challenge of establishing sovereign rights over our surrounding seas through the delineation of our maritime borders. Even 14 years after Timor-Leste became the one hundred and ninety-first Member of the United Nations, we still do not have agreed and defined maritime borders with our two maritime neighbours, Indonesia and Australia. The delineation of our maritime borders will ensure our sovereign rights and give us certainty with respect to what belongs to us, thereby ensuring our economic stability, even our self-sufficiency, and a better future for our people and our nation.\nWe are staunch advocates of dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We believe in the multilateral system and international law, in which all States are equal before the law, regardless of their size or wealth. On the basis of those principles ensuring equality among nations we began discussions with a view to delimiting our maritime borders with Indonesia under international law. We hope to do the same with Australia in a true spirit of openness, transparency and friendship.\nFor that reason, in April Timor-Leste began a process of compulsory conciliation, a mechanism to resolve disputes under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The process, which is being used for the first time, was specifically conceived for cases such as Timor-Leste\u2019s, where there is a dispute regarding maritime borders with a neighbour that withdrew from binding dispute resolution procedures under international law. The first meeting of the compulsory Conciliation Commission was held on 29 August, and we are confident that the panel of independent experts, after reviewing each country\u2019s position, will contribute to reaching an amicable solution. We are certain that Australia, an important country in our region, will participate and contribute in a positive manner to finding a just solution acceptable to both parties.\nIn 2015, Timor-Leste undertook a commitment to assiduously work with all nations so that together we can implement a transformational agenda designed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. The Sustainable Development Goals also include targets, and we must ensure the contribution of all nations to their implementation. In that regard, we can never stress enough the need to find solutions to the challenges that humankind faces, solutions that we must pursue in a spirit of solidarity, as well as the importance of acting in a coordinated fashion,\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Timor-Leste\u2019s belief in the multilateral system and in advocating for fundamental values such as peace and human rights. We would also like to renew our commitment to the preservation of democracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, respect for international law and the buildingof a better future for all peoples and nations, now and in the future.\nOn behalf of Timor-Leste, I truly wish that your term of office, Mr. President, will be crowned by success. Failure is not an option, because humankind is in urgent need of change to ensure the preservation of its existence.\n"

        "file_text": "): I had hoped that I would not have to deliver this statement today, as would have been the case if the cause of my people had been genuinely heard and justly resolved and if hearts and minds had acted to lift my people from oppression.\nAs everyone is aware, we accepted the primacy of international law and the resolutions of international legitimacy, and made a historic and immense sacrifice when the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, accepted the establishment of the State of Palestine based on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nWhat more can be asked of us? We remain committed to the agreements reached with Israel in 1993. However, Israel must reciprocate and act forthwith to resolve all the final-status issues. It must cease all its settlement activities and acts of aggression against our cities, villages and refugee camps. It must cease its policies of collective punishment, its demolition of Palestinian homes, its extrajudicial executions and the arrest of our people. It must release our prisoners and detainees, all thousands of them, and cease its aggression and provocations against the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, for all these policies and practices prevent the creation of an environment in which peace can prevail in our region.\nHow can anyone seeking peace commit such actions? In this regard, we reaffirm that we find the current situation unacceptable. We will never accept the humiliation of our people. We will never accept temporary or interim solutions. Our people will never agree to forgo their national institutions and the other achievements that were won through great sacrifice, suffering and pain. We will preserve the independence of Palestinian decision-making. We will act to fulfil the aspirations of our people through political and diplomatic means, while relying on international law and the legitimacy of international resolutions via the United Nations and all international forums. We will seek to mobilize Arab and international efforts to that end. We will not accept the continuation of the status quo.\nThe 1993 Oslo Accords were intended to end the occupation, to achieve an independent State of Palestine within five years. Yet, Israel renounced the agreements it signed and persists in its occupation and continues to expand its illegal settlements, thereby undermining the realization of the two-State solution on the basis of the 1967 borders. Does Israel want one State? None of the 12 Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 has been implemented, and Israel therefore pursues its plans for the seizure of more Palestinian land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with impunity. The violent actions of Israeli settlers have gone as far as the formation of terrorist groups that burn homes and kill entire families, destroy properties and uproot the trees that are the livelihood of Palestinian families.\nIsrael\u2019s disrespect and contemptuous policies have led to attempts to legalize the settlements and the settlers\u2019 colonization of our occupied land since 1967 and even to the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s claim that the call for the cessation of settlements and their dismantlement constitutes ethnic cleansing. All such claims and attempts are null and void; they are clearly in grave breach of international law.\nSo, who then is practising ethnic cleansing? In that regard, I am compelled to warn the General Assembly again that what the Israeli Government is doing in pursuit of its expansionist settlement plans will destroy whatever chance is left for the adoption of the two-State solution based on the 1967 borders. The settlements are illegal in every respect and in any form. We will therefore continue to exert all efforts for the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the settlements and the terror perpetrated by the settlers. To that end, we are currently undertaking extensive consultations with the Arab countries and other friendly countries. We hope that no one will cast a veto against this draft resolution.\nThe racial discrimination against the Palestinian people has become a daily reality as Israel continues to favour the Israeli settlers on our occupied land, including by granting them permits for residential construction, factories, economic projects and infrastructure, such as roads, electricity and water networks. At the same time, Israel is preventing the Palestinians \u2014 the owners of the land \u2014 from using their land and prohibiting them from developing their economy in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley and the Palestinian shores on the Dead Sea. It continues with its illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip, as well as with its illegal alteration of the identity and status of occupied East Jerusalem and its acts of aggression and provocation against our Christian and Muslim holy sites, especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque. That is playing with fire. I repeat, it is playing with fire. No one knows what may happen if those acts of aggression continue.\nAll of those Israeli policies, actions and measures are reasons for the failure of every international effort for the past 13 years, particularly those of the Quartet, in the same way that Israel has sabotaged the efforts of successive American Administrations over the decades. In that regard, I have to once again appeal to the United Nations to help provide international protection for the Palestinian people, who since 1967 have been suffering under occupation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip. I am very grateful in that regard to the Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council, who convened an Arria Formula meeting of the Council to explore the possibilities of international protection for our people, and I urge that such efforts continue. If the United Nations cannot ensure our protection, who will?\nToday Israel continues its attempts to evade the possibility of an international conference for peace, an idea proposed by France and supported by most of the countries of the world. A ministerial meeting, in which 28 countries and three intergovernmental organizations participated, was held in Paris in June to prepare for the convening of such a conference. We continue to hope that holding such a conference can lead to the establishment of a mechanism and a defined time frame for ending the occupation, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative \u2014 which, among other things, calls for a just and agreed-on solution for Palestinian refugees, in accordance with resolution 194 (III). We hope that every country in the world will support convening such a peace conference before the end of this year. Without an international peace conference and direct negotiations between us and the Israelis, how can we make peace or even speak about it?\nInstead of ensuring that Israel acknowledges the atrocities it continues to commit against our people, the Israeli Prime Minister has had the audacity to criticize Palestine\u2019s statement at the Arab League Summit in Nouakchott, Mauritania, because it referred to the Balfour Declaration. I say to him today that our recognition in 1993 of the existence of the State of Israel, a recognition that continues to be valid, is not free of charge. Israel should reciprocate with its own recognition of the State of Palestine and end its occupation of our land, so that the State of Palestine and the State of Israel can coexist alongside each other, in peace and security, as good neighbours, each within secure and recognized borders.\nThere is no conflict between us and the Jewish religion and people. Our conflict is with the Israeli occupation of our land. We have full respect for the Jewish religion, which is a monotheistic one, just as we respect other religions, and in that regard we condemn the catastrophe of the Holocaust that befell the Jewish people in Europe during the Second World War. It was one of the most heinous crimes ever perpetrated against humankind. A historic reconciliation between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples requires that Israel acknowledge its responsibility for the Nakba that is still being inflicted on our people to this very day. Such an acknowledgement would open a new era of coexistence and serve to build bridges rather than walls. I believe that the Arab Peace Initiative embodies a reasonable, sensible solution. Yet Israel continues to insist on being selective, picking and choosing only parts of the Initiative, such as insisting on establishing relations with the Arab countries before ending its occupation of Palestine. That is simply a recipe for more conflict in the region. We will not accept it and neither will anyone else. The Arab Peace Initiative should be implemented in full, from A to Z, and Israel must understand that.\nBy the end of the coming year, 100 years will have passed since the Balfour Declaration; 70 since the Nakba of the Palestinian people; and 50 since Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Yes, 100 years have passed since the promulgation of the infamous Balfour Declaration, whereby Britain gave the land of Palestine to another people without any right, authority or consent from anyone. That paved the way for the Nakba and the Palestinian people\u2019s dispossession and displacement from their land. As if that were not enough, the British mandate translated the Declaration into policies and measures that helped to perpetrate heinous crimes against a peaceful people in their own land, a people who had never attacked or taken part in a war against anyone. As we approach the 100th anniversary of that infamous Declaration, we would like to ask the British to draw the necessary lessons and shoulder their historical, legal, political, material and moral responsibilities for it, including an apology to the Palestinian people for the disasters, misery and injustice that it has created, and to act to rectify that historic catastrophe and remedy its consequences, including through recognition of the State of Palestine. That is the least Britain can do.\nIn addition, since 1948, Israel has persisted in its contempt for international legitimacy by violating resolution 181 (II), known as the partition resolution, which called for the establishment of two States on the historic land of Palestine according to a specific partition plan. Israeli forces seized more land than was allotted to Israel, constituting a grave breach of Articles 39, 41 and 42 of the Charter of the United Nations. In paragraph (c) of that resolution, the General Assembly requests that the Security Council\n\u201cdetermine as a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression, in accordance with Article 39 of the Charter, any attempt to alter by force the settlement envisaged by this resolution\u201d.\nRegrettably, however, the Security Council is not discharging its responsibility to hold Israel accountable for seizing territory allotted to the Palestinian State under the partition resolution. Over half of the Palestinian territory was taken by Israel. To reiterate, the Security Council is not discharging its responsibility to hold Israel accountable for its seizure of territory allotted to the Palestinian State under the partition resolution. I appeal to everyone to read resolution 181 (II) once again.\nWe continue our efforts to promote a culture of peace among our people. We stand firmly against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We condemn terrorism regardless of who perpetrates it or where it is perpetrated. Our region has been the principal victim of terrorism, a scourge that it has endured for many years. We support the unity of people and respect for territorial integrity. We are in favour of reaching political solutions for the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq and elsewhere. We commend the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to strengthen the foundations of legitimacy in Yemen. We support the efforts to confront and overcome terrorism, extremism, sectarianism and violence. I appeal to everyone to stand united against terrorism. Terrorism knows no religion.\nIn that connection, I wish to reaffirm that there is no way to defeat terrorism and extremism and achieve security and stability in our region unless we end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and ensure the freedom and independence of the Palestinian people. Fighting terrorism and extremism begins with the ending of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\nWe continue our genuine, dedicated efforts to achieve Palestinian reconciliation with the formation of a national unity Government in accordance with the political platform of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections. We are committed to rebuilding Gaza, alleviating the hardships of our people and lifting the illegal blockade imposed on them.\nOur hand remains outstretched to those interested in peacebuilding. There is one outstanding question that we have to keep asking over and over again, namely, is there any leader in Israel, the occupying Power, who truly desires to make peace and abandon the mentality of hegemony, expansionism and colonization? Is there any Israeli leader who will recognize the rights of our people and end the historical injustice inflicted upon them? It is Israel\u2019s breach of the agreements it has signed and its failure to comply with the obligations it has assumed that have caused the deadlock and stalemate in which we find ourselves.\nThe State of Palestine, which was accorded the status of observer State in the United Nations with the support of 138 countries, is a State under occupation. The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization \u2014 the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people wherever they may be \u2014 acts on behalf of our people and as their Government. The Palestine National Council is the Parliament of the State of Palestine, as reflected in resolution 67/19.\nWe have not lost hope yet. We expect the international community to shoulder its responsibilities. We call on countries that have acted against our people to rectify such injustices. Moreover, we appeal to countries that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so. Those who believe in the two-State solution \u2014 and everyone speaks about the two-State solution \u2014 should recognize both States and not just one of them.\nI invite the General Assembly to mark this seventy- first session by declaring 2017 as the international year to end the Israeli occupation of our land. In June 2017 half a century will have elapsed since the abhorrent Israeli occupation began. I also appeal to members, as a follow-up to resolution 67/19, to adopt a draft resolution that will enable Palestine to submit and co-sponsor draft resolutions on subjects other than the question of Palestine and to support our efforts to enhance Palestine\u2019s legal and political status by granting it additional responsibilities to chair committees and groups as we continue our quest for full membership in international organizations.\nGiven all this, the international community is called upon, now more than ever, to exert all efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the land of the State of Palestine. As members are aware, this is the longest and the last occupation in contemporary history. If the international community were to deliver on its ability to advance the rights of our people, ensure the exercise of those same rights and end the oppression and injustice imposed on our people for seven decades, that would surely present a unique opportunity for peace, stability and coexistence in our region and between the Palestinian and Israeli people. It would create a better future for the current generation and succeeding generations. It would be a beginning, a basis for ending extremism and violence in our region and the world.\nI hope, from the depths of my heart, that the Israeli occupation of our land will end, that we can defeat terrorism, that the current conflicts will be concluded and that peace will prevail in our region and around the world. Our people will continue to open the door to peace and do all we can to grant our people freedom and independence. We will remain steadfast in our land, and we will work to prepare the future of the next generation. It is my hope that I will not have to deliver this same statement again next year. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that 2017 is the year when the occupation ends. Will the Assembly discharge that responsibility? I truly hope so.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to address the General Assembly, to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and to express Peru\u2019s willingness to contribute to the success of his stewardship.\nTwo months ago, when I began my term as President of the Republic of Peru, I expressed a commitment to the goals set forth by the founders of our Republic. In 2021, Peruvians will celebrate 200 years of our independent life, thereby consolidating a sound democracy, one that is socially functional and prosperous, with better opportunities for jobs and equality and where human rights are promoted. Our Government\u2019s plans and public policies coincide with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which are enshrined in the 2030 Agenda. They include access to water, education, health care for all Peruvians and other services that are vital in order to drastically reduce poverty, in the context of a full-scale battle against corruption, discrimination, insecurity and drug trafficking.\nOne key objective of my Government is to ensure the efficient management of safe water and sanitation for all. We will ensure access to drinking water and sewerage systems for all those families that do not now have such basic services, which accounts for about 10 million inhabitants, or almost a third of our people. We will make a significant investment that will prioritize the Amazon and Andean regions. We will work with non-traditional systems for potable water for non-urban areas, and we will implement systems for rainwater-harvesting in the Amazon and undertake public works through the reforestation programme known as \u201cBlue Mountains\u201d, aimed at harvesting water in the highlands of the Andean Mountains. I believe that interaction with the United Nations in that regard is a priority. I am therefore very honoured to have participated in the High-level Panel on Water just a few days ago.\nAnother very important issue for my Government is to promote green growth, while coordinating the use of land-based and marine ecosystems. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change should serve as an inspiration for us to implement those policies. Peru is a country that is particularly vulnerable, and we see that on a daily basis in the melting of our glaciers and in the extreme cold that occurs in southern Peru sometimes, both of which have compelled us to redirect our scarce resources to meet those challenges.\nPeru is promoting such policies so as to become a member, as quickly as possible, of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. My Government\u2019s Administration has a clear vision of the new challenges and responsibilities that Peru must grapple with, which leads us to deepen our agreements with countries that have similar prospects, problems and challenges. They include our partners in the Pacific Alliance, namely, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. It would also include Brazil and Argentina, which are important neighbours, along with Ecuador. Together with them, we are tackling, in a harmonious and coordinated manner, the challenges of development in the twenty- first century.\nPeru has a firm commitment to defending and definitively strengthening representative democracy, human rights and the rule of law. That commitment was clearly enshrined in the democratic Charter of the Organization of American States. In that context, fundamental freedoms, the right to participate freely in political life and the separation of, and respect for, the balance of powers are the cornerstones for the governability of our region and can ensure a future with hope.\nWe also respect the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, something that was established and introduced by the Latin American countries as a norm of international law a century ago. However, respect for that principle cannot, and should not, go against defence interests and the promotion of democracy and human rights, which consitute an irrevovable heritage for future generations. In that context, it is imperative to mention our concern regarding the critical political, economic and social situation that our friends in Venezuela are currently experiencing. Full-fledged democracy requires absolute respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as due process. It also requires fully guaranteeing respect for the separation and balance of powers. The situation in Venezuela has been impacted by extreme violence, social and political confrontation and severe shortages of food and medicine. In order to address that multifaceted crisis, we call in solidarity for an internal political dialogue to begin as soon as possible, without conditions or restrictions and within a context of full respect for the Constitution. Peru is ready and willing to undertake all the necessary efforts that might assist our Venezuelan friends in bringing about a solution to their problems. We will work with the countries of the Pacific Alliance in that endeavour, especially with Venezuela\u2019s neighbouring country of Colombia, where we shall be in a few days to witness the signing of the peace agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia.\nIn conclusion, I would like to convey to the General Assembly that the Government that I lead in Peru is an advocate of modernization, compatible with the efforts promoted by the United Nations system, in a global, interdependent context, which has, however, unfortunately been affected by a series of grave conflicts that have been mentioned here today and throughout all of our debates.\nVarious parts of the world are experiencing a crisis of confidence, setbacks in globalization, populist and protectionist temptations and an almost unprecedented wave of refugees, as the King of Jordan mentioned a moment ago. Our aim in South America and Latin America is to create a bridge of stability and cooperation between the Pacific and the Atlantic that seeks to promote the gradual restoration of peace and prosperity in the western hemisphere.\nFinally, I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on his decade of service to the international community in such an important role.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to add Seychelles\u2019 voice to those who have congratulated Ambassador Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his commitment and strong leadership as the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\nHumankind finds itself on the cusp of achieving the immeasurable in terms of making a true difference to all peoples of the world. As we embark upon this new collaborative journey, our sustained momentum could be a catalyst for positive change. We need an institution that is not afraid of change and is able to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. Such terms as inclusiveness, compromise and equality should resonate throughout the Organization. On this note, allow me to reiterate Seychelles\u2019 calls for fair reform within this Hall, while renewing our commitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe chosen theme for this year\u2019s Assembly, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, reminds us of the urgency of the present moment. Within the context of change and transformation, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) played a significant and crucial role, which was to herald a much-needed call for nations to improve the livelihoods of society\u2019s weak and marginalized by addressing poverty in its many forms, while also promoting human rights and environmental sustainability.\nSeychelles is proud to have achieved most of the targets set out in the MDGs and remains eager to fulfil its responsibility to sustain the momentum in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yes, we recognize that progress has been made both nationally and internationally, but we also recognize that much still needs to be done.\nIn Seychelles that recognition is reflected by our push to integrate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063 into our national development strategy. However, I believe that the path to transformation is not one that can be travelled alone. SDG 17, which focuses on global partnership for sustainable development, reaffirms this point.\nFor real change to occur, the world will need to stand together in ensuring that strong action is backed by the adequate financial support that is needed for overall achievement of the Goals, including giving due consideration to the special conditions that small States and small island developing States are faced with. The implementation of a vulnerability index in development frameworks would enable a fairer measurement of economies and serve as a more appropriate reference tool for financial support than the traditionally emphasized per capita gross domestic product.\nGoal 14 in particular plays a pertinent role in our peoples\u2019 lives. The conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development has become pivotal to the survival of small-island economies.\nAs a champion of the Blue Economy initiative, which is directed at reinforcing marine-related activities for sustainability purposes, Seychelles recognizes that our oceans present an abundance of untapped opportunities for sustained growth. It is therefore imperative to highlight that the Blue Economy concept and SDG 14 are synonymous with the global action to harness the power of the oceans as a tool for transformation. It is important in this endeavour that we shift the paradigm and view the world in innovative ways. In relation to the Blue Economy, the \u201cblue bonds\u201d initiative and the debt-swap agreement serve as tangible examples of Seychelles\u2019 contribution to the debate.\nOne of the elements underpinning the Blue Economy approach is action to address climate change. Because Seychelles is an island nation heavily dependent upon the environment for its survival, climate change and its adverse effects occupy a permanent place in the minds of our people. We are exposed to its devastating consequences not as mere bystanders, but through first-hand experience, which affects our families and threatens our livelihoods. Addressing the impacts of climate change is therefore an essential part of the discussion, as it involves the very future of our country. With this in mind, Seychelles is compelled to put itself at the forefront of the fight against climate change, for it is a battle that we cannot afford to lose. In this vein, the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which Seychelles was among the first 20 States to ratify, has been an encouraging sign of the international community\u2019s renewed political will to push for positive change.\nThe security of our oceans forms yet another integral part of the drive towards human progress. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing imperils this progress not only by endangering our marine ecosystems, but also by harming food security and jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Seychelles therefore renews its commitment to ensuring that such violations do not go unanswered. Furthermore, although we have seen tremendous gains in the long battle fought against piracy, we need to remain vigilant and strengthen our own efforts to reduce piracy-related activities in our oceans. To that end, the work undertaken through such initiatives as the Contact Group for Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, which Seychelles currently chairs, is essential for our continued success.\nSeychelles fully supports all international efforts aimed at seeking a diplomatic and political solution to the ongoing crisis in Syria, which continues to rage at the expense of the innocent. We deeply hope that a solution is found to further contribute to mitigating the spread of extremism and ideologies of hate, which continues to wreak devastating consequences on various countries throughout the world.\nThe World Humanitarian Summit in Turkey and the recent high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants hosted by the President of the General Assembly serve to highlight the scale of the challenges facing the global community. Such challenges also solicit deeper reflection on the plight of the more than 60 million people in the world who are displaced as a result of conflicts and natural disasters linked to climate change. Seychelles calls upon the international community for renewed collaboration among States and stronger moral resolve, as together we endeavour to address the global humanitarian crisis that is weighing heavily on the heart of humankind.\nSeychelles welcomes the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, and we reiterate our hope to see an end to the painful economic embargo on a sister island nation.\nLastly, I wish to take this opportunity to express our utmost appreciation for the dynamism, hard work and devotion of our outgoing Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during his term in office. He leaves behind a strong legacy of determination to create a more peaceful and equal future for the world. Furthermore, his championing of the cause of small islands will remain engraved in our collective memory. We are certain that his contributions to improving society will continue to have positive repercussions and that the new Secretary- General will follow in his righteous path.\nIn conclusion, I am hopeful for the future we believe in and that the inherent goodness of humankind will lead us to do what is right. At this critical time we have a shared responsibility to cast aside our differences and focus on what unites us rather than what divides us. I hope that together we can commence our universal push to transform our world, not only for ourselves but for generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "This year we agreed that the general debate would aim to give a universal push to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I would like to focus on the particularly important Sustainable Development Goal 5 \u2014 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls \u2014 because today\u2019s greatest challenges, from climate change to fighting terrorism to ending the world\u2019s deadliest conflicts, can be resolved only with the full participation of both genders, especially women. Further, the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals will require that we dedicate special attention to women, because they are the ones who feel the greatest impacts and are most likely to be left behind and ignored. Let us look at some of the other Sustainable Development Goals to see the truth of this assertion.\nFirst, with respect to Goal 1 \u2014 ending poverty \u2014 both women and men are affected, but lifting women out of poverty is much more difficult. As if poverty were not hard enough, women also face gender-based discrimination, stereotyping and social marginalization. According to one UN-Women report, around the world, a woman earns approximately 24 per cent less than a man, finds it more difficult to get a loan to start a business, and is likely to receive a smaller inheritance or nothing if she decides to leave her husband. The trend towards the feminization of poverty has to be changed. By not allowing women to prosper, we condemn entire families and all of society.\nSecondly, with respect to Goal 2 \u2014 ending hunger \u2014 although around half of the world\u2019s agricultural work is done by women, when food runs out women are the first to suffer. When public order breaks down, a woman\u2019s trip to bring her family food or water may easily cause her to lose her life. In times of hunger, women give the little food they have to their families and children. In a bread line, however, they often end up being pushed aside or abused. Empowering women by expanding land ownership or providing credit would not only feed a family, but would also raise female incomes and make more food available for all.\nThirdly, with respect to Goal 4 \u2014 providing education \u2014 for so many girls and women around the world, following the road to inclusive learning and education remains an impossible task. According to the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Report, out of the world\u2019s 750 million illiterate adults, two thirds are women. Girls are sent off or sold into early marriages, which blocks their path to education, higher income and independence. Criminals abduct women and sell them into slavery. Extremists burn down schools and kill teachers because they do not want educated girls to make their own decisions or make their own life choices.\nNaturally, that needs to change. Education is a key that opens many doors. Educated women are a tremendous resource and a force for the common good for all of us. Women must be free to have access to education and choose the profession they want. Information technologies must be available to uncover their full potential.\nThe task ahead of us is immense. However, it can be achieved if each of us finds the strength and courage to become part of the change by encouraging women to dream big and demand their rightful place in national parliaments, in politics, at negotiating tables, in science labs and on company boards; by ensuring that nothing can stand in the way of a girl\u2019s dream to receive a free high-quality education; by combating gender stereotypes and abusive social practices; and by making sure that life and laws give women and girls the equal voice and power that they deserve.\nThere is a new perspective to consider today. If we reduce the cost of gender-based violence today we can save the world about 2 per cent of lost gross national product. If this money were not lost, it could be directed into poverty reduction and development. It is an additional development resource for the world. We cannot afford to fail in this challenge. It is too costly to allow gender-based violence to exist. To this end, we need everyone on board because only if all members of society \u2014 both women and men \u2014 are fully represented and engaged can the world\u2019s future be truly sustainable. Indeed, without it we cannot think at all about sustainable development in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Today, we bear witness to a digital transformation all over the globe. So far, it has been reflected above all in the global economy. However, there is no doubt that, very soon, that transformation will substantially affect every aspect of social life \u2014 at the local, regional, and international levels. I was fascinated by the announcement of the United States Department of Labor that 65 per cent of today\u2019s students will be employed in jobs that do not exist at present. It is true that such forecasts are more valid for the most developed countries, but the very essence of the digital transformation is rapidly spreading across the globe.\nBe that as it may, such remarkable technological progress should be welcomed. We are filled with hope that, in this way, we can find solutions to unsolved problems. However, like similar changes in the past, today\u2019s fourth industrial revolution will bring about new problems and deepen some of the old challenges that humankind is facing.\nI will speak first about inequality. Yet the issue of inequality relates not only to the sense of social justice or injustice but increasingly to world peace. Today\u2019s world has not yet come to understand, let alone rid itself of, the traditional reasons for the use of force within and between countries. And there is already a new challenge ahead of us, namely, how we should regulate technological progress so that it benefits everyone, and not just a privileged minority. The information revolution has paved the way to a global awareness of social inequalities. I believe that that is one of the main triggers of social conflicts, including in the international community.\nThe question of legal and any other regulation of the digital transformation is certainly a new issue on the agenda. That also holds true for the most developed countries in the international community. However, the globalization of the digital transformation is occurring so swiftly that it will have to be actively addressed by the United Nations. We will encounter difficulties and obstacles at the beginning, but eventually historic necessity will force us to pool our efforts.\nPooling our efforts in creating effective regulation on climate change proves that we can be successful in our endeavours. It is quite possible that one of the elements of success was the fact that climate change is a major factor of global migration. And as long as migration is not regulated, it will continue to cause the world\u2019s paramount security problem. In that sense, migration is yet another catalyst for the international community to find appropriate common solutions.\nIn any and all contexts, the peaceful resolution of conflicts is absolutely essential. With regard to its fundamental reason for existence, it seems that the United Nations is not effective enough. That should be a further reminder that the Organization ought to adapt to the new circumstances and balance of powers. If the United Nations system is not successful in coping with international conflicts, it risks being sidelined. The use of force as an extreme means of dispute resolution without the necessary endorsement by the United Nations \u2014 for example, in the fight against terrorism \u2014 risks bringing about the decline of the political and security architecture established after the Second World War.\nThe next leader of the United Nations is therefore of crucial importance. My country, Slovenia, is proud to have presented Mr. Danilo T\u00fcrk, our former Head of State and former Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs with a decades-long commitment to the United Nations, as a candidate for that eminent post. I am firmly convinced that he is a strong and credible candidate and that it is time that a Secretary- General came from among the Group of Eastern European States.\nI like to present my country as smart, green and of just the right size to be a reference country in many different aspects, but Slovenia also stands for democracy, equality and the peaceful resolution of disputes, and it respects international law and principles. We have built our community of nations on respect for international law and on the protection of individuals and their human rights. If we wish our societies to flourish, such duties must never be far from our minds.\nMy country is also a strong supporter of effective multilateralism and is among those countries that strive to bring the global community closer to universal respect for human rights, promote respect for international law, strengthen the rule of law, foster preventive diplomacy, particularly in the field of mediation, protect peace and security, promote gender equality, protect the elderly, preserve natural resources, implement sustainable development goals and ensure a decent life for all.\nSlovenia will promote these principles within the United Nations, including as a member of the Human Rights Council and a candidate for its presidency in 2018, as a current Chair of the Human Security Network and as a member of various informal groupings within the United Nations, as well as within other regional organizations and groupings of which we are members.\nAfter the truly landmark previous session of the General Assembly, it is now time to start implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which, together with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, provides a signpost for and a vision of a more sustainable future for our planet and prosperity for its people.\nWe will also continue our efforts to have May 20 proclaimed World Bee Day. Our activities during this session of the General Assembly will take place mainly within the context of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and we expect to present a resolution in New York during the Assembly\u2019s seventy-second session. We believe that strengthening our common care for bees and other pollinators is needed to ensure food security, biodiversity and sustainable development.\nLet me conclude by saying that it was a tremendous privilege to work with the outgoing Secretary-General. I would like to pay tribute to him and to thank him for his determined efforts to promote the United Nations, its values and its goals. We will remember him for his tireless endeavours to make the world a better place. Let us fervently hope that the next Secretary-General will do the same, and even better, for the sake of humanity and of our children and grandchildren.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate you, Sir, upon your election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. You can count on Finland \u0301s full support in your important responsibilities.\nThis will be the last General Assembly for the current Secretary-General in that capacity. I thank him for his untiring efforts to advance the common good of humankind. During his time in office, he has been instrumental in setting an ambitious agenda for sustainable development and for tackling climate change. Those achievements will make a difference for generations to come. We had the pleasure of hosting the Secretary-General last December, when Finland marked its sixtieth anniversary as a Member of the United Nations. It was an opportunity to remind ourselves of what the United Nations stands for. The United Nations is the embodiment and arbiter of the\nrules-based international system of sovereign States. It is the only truly global body that we have, but we must work together to ensure that it functions better in fulfilling its many tasks.\nUnfortunately, the world continues to confront challenges to international peace and security all over. Narrow-minded nationalism, racism and violent extremism are on the rise. We must battle those destructive ideologies. The recent nuclear test by North Korea is a cause for grave concern. The conflict in Ukraine still awaits its resolution. All illegal actions, including the annexation of Crimea by Russia, are to be condemned. The complex and horrendous conflicts in and around Syria and Iraq continue to affect not only the Middle East but, indirectly, also Europe, including my own country, Finland.\nSuch conflicts have already killed and maimed hundreds of thousands and displaced many more. They have given rise to unprecedented flows of asylum- seekers towards and into Europe. European societies are compassionate, but today they are under stress. Their capacity to provide for asylum-seekers and to integrate them at home, or to provide humanitarian assistance abroad, has limits.\nDuring the week of the United Nations high-level meeting, we discussed refugees and migration, and for good reason. We have to work together to find sustainable solutions at the global and regional levels to better control borders, while safeguarding the rights of those seeking international protection on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution. That requires\nvision, courage and leadership. The alternative is stark: borders will become walls closed even to those entitled to refugee status.\nThe problem is severe. Every day tens of thousands of people are displaced as a result of conflict, persecution or natural disasters, while others are on the move seeking a better life. There is an increasing need for humanitarian assistance. The European Union and my country, as a member, will continue to shoulder their share of responsibility in efforts to deal with the crisis, but it will never be enough. Humanitarian action will never compensate for the inability to address the root causes of forced migration.\nIt is important to take a longer-term perspective. The conflicts that we are now facing require urgent humanitarian action, and yet the underlying causes are long term. Economic, social and political progress is, therefore, imperative. The international community can and must assist. The United Nations, for its part, can help to defuse latent conflicts through conflict prevention, mediation and, if necessary, preventive peace operations. However, the ultimate responsibility for redesigning societies lies with the peoples concerned and their Governments. Local ownership is the solution. For a number of years Finland and Turkey have led efforts to strengthen United Nations-based mediation. There is a need to foster closer cooperation between different actors, such as traditional and religious leaders, and to draw more participation from civil society. We are pleased that progress is being made, as evidenced by the adoption of the latest General Assembly resolution on mediation (resolution 70/304) just two weeks ago.\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Finland\u2019s participation in United Nations peacekeeping. Since 1956, some 50,000 Finnish men and women have served in United Nations operations around the world. Finnish citizens continue to serve in the Middle East and elsewhere, and some of them have made the ultimate sacrifice. We honour the work of those men and women.\nFinland is committed to ongoing efforts aimed at strengthening the various aspects of peace operations. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to bring United Nations peacekeeping into the twenty-first century. The Leaders\u2019 Summit on Peacekeeping hosted by President Obama of the United States last year was a significant step in the right direction and needs to be continued.\nThe problem of the illicit flow of conventional weapons persists, but finally progress has been made \u2014 the Arms Trade Treaty has entered into force. However, two tasks remain \u2014 the Treaty needs to be adopted by all and implemented effectively. It has not been ratified by many of the Member States whose contributions are needed, and so I urge Members to join without delay.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a year ago was a milestone, as was the conclusion of the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. The true test, however, will be the implementation of those instruments, which, in Finland, is being carried out in an inclusive way. We are focusing on establishing partnerships among the Government, the private sector, universities and civil society. All Finnish citizens are encouraged to get involved. I have personally committed to reducing my carbon footprint by half over a decade by signing up with the Global Citizens Climate Pledge initiative. The initiative was made global a couple of weeks ago in an event hosted by the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A similar mechanism exists for inclusive participation in support of the 2030 Agenda.\nGender equality and the political, economic and social empowerment of girls and women are key drivers for sustainable development and for combating climate change. In my own country, gender equality has been vital in our rise from poverty to prosperity. I welcome all efforts that raise the issue, such as the HeForShe movement initiated by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. I am personally involved in that important work. However, the United Nations and its Member States still have a long way to go to meet their target of gender equality.\nThe next Secretary-General will be subject to almost colossal expectations. Finland welcomes a selection process that is more transparent and more inclusive. We also welcome the fact that there are so many female candidates interested in the position.\nWe too have a message for the incoming United Nations leader. We would like to see the new Secretary- General work closely together with, and, if necessary, sometimes even one step ahead of, the Security Council in fulfilling the mandate of the Charter of the United Nations. Another challenge is to improve the United Nation\u2019s functions as an organization. The next Secretary-General can do that by ensuring that the various United Nation activities complement each other, so that the United Nations truly delivers as one.\nLet me finish by assuring the Assembly of Finland\u2019s full support for the incoming Secretary- General \u2014 whoever she or he may be.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish him every success in his endeavours.\nSince its participation in the establishment of the United Nations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made every possible effort to achieve the noble purposes to which we all aspire. Today, under the leadership of His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, we are doing our utmost to contribute to the maintenance of peace, security and stability, not only in our region but throughout the world.\nWe attach great importance to combating terrorism. We were the among the earliest victims of terrorism. In 1992, we were subjected to more than 100 terrorist operations, including 18 operations perpetrated by elements linked to a country of the region. Even before the events of September 11 2001, the Kingdom worked on an agreement among Arab countries to combat terrorism. We have been and are still waging a war to combat terrorist organizations. We have also joined more than 12 international agreements, and, in partnership with the United States and Italy, we are co-chairing the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Moreover, in order to rectify the extremist thinking among some individuals, we have established the Mohammed bin Naif Counseling and Care Center to provide care and to criminalize terrorism and its funding.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is home to many Islamic religious sites. We were the first to condemn the terrorist attacks of 11 September. We have expressed our solidarity with the United States and we have sought to uproot terrorism. Security forces in the Kingdom have been able to uncover 268 terrorist operations before they took place, including operations against friendly countries. We find it odd that in the United States there is an attempt to ratify a law on sovereign immunity, which will have negative repercussions.\nWe believe that fighting terrorism requires international participation and an international partnership. We need concerted efforts at all levels in order to counter terrorism at the security, intellectual, financial and military levels. We also stress that fighting terrorism requires cooperation based on the rules and principles for which this Organization was established.\nWe also wish to commend the role of the Islamic military coalition to combat terrorism, which was established in Riyadh by 40 Islamic countries. We have provided all possible support and facilities to the command centre so that it can lead the efforts to combat terrorism. We hope the international community will participate in supporting this international centre to combat terrorism.\nThe international community must take all possible measures to put an end to the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian people. We believe that the Arab Peace Initiative should form the basis for restoring peace to the region in order to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights and establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. We also condemn Israeli aggressions and attacks against Al-Aqsa mosque and the construction work that threatens the sanctity of the mosque.\nThe coalition forces that support Yemen\u2019s legitimacy have sought to help the Yemeni people. The international community has rejected what the rebels are attempting to do. The Kingdom supports the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to reach a political resolution based on Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the outcomes of the Yemen National Dialogue. The legitimate Government accepted this proposal, but the rebels rejected it and they continue to threaten and kill innocent civilians.\nWe are the biggest supporter of humanitarian operations in Yemen. We have provided humanitarian and development assistance, amounting to about 2 per cent of our income, to 95 countries. That is in addition to our humanitarian work for which purpose we have established the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre.\nThe crisis in Syria has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and injured, displaced millions and calls on us all to put an end to an unprecedented tragedy. Based on the first Geneva conference on the crisis in Syria, it is high time to find a political solution to the crisis that would ensure Syria\u2019s unity and maintain its institutions. Since the beginning of the crisis, the Kingdom has opened its doors to host hundreds of thousands of Syrians, not as refugees in camps but on the basis of brotherly and ethical principles in order to maintain their dignity and safety. We have provided them with all of the necessary facilities, as well as health care. We also provided them with job and education opportunities.\nWe call on our brothers and sisters in Libya to continue to rebuild their State and confront the terrorist groups. With regard to Iraq, we stress that it is important to maintain Iraq\u2019s unity and territorial integrity and rid the country of all terrorist groups. We condemn any activity that leads to strife and violence.\nOur embassy in Tehran and our consulate in Mashhad were the targets of attacks under the watchful eye of the Iranian authorities. They have not provided us with sufficient protection, as stipulated in international agreements. We therefore call on the Iranian authorities to assume their responsibility in that regard. We seek good relations with Iran based on the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs. We call for the end of the Iranian occupation of the three Emirati islands\nWe assert that all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction must be eliminated from the Middle East and that a date must be set for the international conference to create a Middle East free of nuclear weapons. The Kingdom is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the principles of Islam. We call for the adoption of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe also need to look at sources of energy as complementary and not as alternatives to other energy sources and in a way that would ensure sustainable development for all. In that regard, we note that the Kingdom has invested in developing new carbon capture technology in our effort to protect and preserve the environment.\nWe would also like to highlight the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was ratified by the General Assembly last year. We have launched our vision for 2030, which is based on the main principles of the 2030 Agenda, on Arab and Islamic cultures and traditions and on our geographic location. That vision is aimed at advancing our economy and achieved development in the fields of energy, industry, health, education, tourism and other fields.\nIn order to increase our non-oil exports and create the necessary conditions to attract local and international investment, we have also worked with the private sector so that it could become the State\u2019s main partner. We have also provided essential services in health, education and housing.\nWe will spare no effort in working with the international community in order to achieve the good of humankind. We will continue to play our role at the humanitarian, political and economic levels. We will also seek to reform United Nations agencies and are confident that the Organization will be able to respond to tomorrow\u2019s challenges so that future generations will enjoy peace, security and stability.\n"

        "file_text": "First, let me join the other speakers in congratulating Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to assure him of our full support. We would also like to express our thanks to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his most able stewardship of the Assembly at its seventieth session.\nThis session is convened at a time when the United Nations is facing tremendous challenges. Earlier this week two high-level events sought to address the plight of refugees and considered ways to meet the legitimate expectations of millions of migrant workers.\nThe global economy is slowing down, thereby affecting all nations\u2019 prosperity. New transcontinental trade and investment arrangements may lead to a weakened World Trade Organization and a fragmented world economy. That could signal the beginning of a new round of negative and damaging competition among global markets. The evolution of the global community of nations in the decades to come will depend largely upon our ability to cooperate and find a common language.\nOur foreign policy reflects a deep-rooted belief in the power of dialogue. A call for dialogue is the central message of my President, set out in his \u201cManifesto: the world, the twenty-first century\u201d, which has been circulated as an official document of the Security Council and the General Assembly (A/70/818, annex). The Manifesto offers a realistic perspective on the world and an ambitious vision based on unity, rather than division, and on cooperation, rather than rivalry. It identifies a lack of trust among major nations and regional groups as the main obstacle to progress towards a true community of nations. That statement rings especially true in the area of nuclear disarmament, where it is the passionate wish of the President of Kazakhstan to achieve, by 2045, the centennial year of the United Nations, a world free of nuclear weapons.\nAs a country that closed, 25 years ago, the largest nuclear test site in its territory and renounced the world\u2019s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, we have the full moral right and responsibility to push forward the disarmament process. On 29 August, the International Day against Nuclear Tests, Astana hosted a major international conference that stressed a sense of urgency in dealing with the nuclear threat and generated massive support for the anti-nuclear movement. The outcome document calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to honour their obligations and take practical steps to achieve nuclear zero. In November, the Astana peace summit will be convened in my country to craft a viable strategic approach based on our objective of global peace and security, with nuclear disarmament as a crucial element of any future peace efforts.\nMy country was the initial sponsor of resolution 70/57, on the achievement of a nuclear-weapon-free world, which was adopted in December 2015. We host the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s Low- Enriched Uranium Bank for the peaceful use of nuclear fuel. September marks the tenth anniversary of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. Also known as the Treaty of Semipalatinsk, it is the most recent major breakthrough in global disarmament. We support the establishment of similar zones across the globe, and especially in the Middle East, where we believe that such measures will strengthen global and regional security.\nRegrettably, international negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled, while numerous loopholes in international law are used to sidestep the ban on the military use of nuclear technology. That is why we endorsed the report of the August meeting of the Open- ended Working Group on Nuclear Disarmament. The group recommends convening a conference next year to start negotiations on comprehensive and complete nuclear disarmament, with a view to eventually stigmatizing the possession of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we continue to support the Conference on Disarmament and hope that its members will generate enough political will to revitalize the work of that important body, in order to achieve its ultimate goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world.\nIn the same vein, we will work resolutely towards the universal application and enforcement of all the relevant international instruments. As an article XIV co-Chair of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, we stand for a complete ban on nuclear testing and believe that the unacceptable and irresponsible actions of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea seriously undermine stability and security in North- East Asia and worldwide. Furthermore, such actions have undermined the entire disarmament process.\nControlling the means of delivery is a vital element of disarmament. As a Chair of The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, we will submit a draft resolution to the General Assembly in October to stress the importance of the universal application of The Hague Code.\nKazakhstan\u2019s Manifesto declares war on war and calls for the total elimination of that ugly phenomenon from our lives. We continue to stress the fact that the existence of military blocs hinders international cooperation and creates situations in which the security of individual countries is ensured at the expense of others. Moreover, sanctions and economic fragmentation are counterproductive and create new lines of division that serve to alienate nations.\nGenuine security is based on mutual dialogue. With that idea in mind, our President played a role in restoring cooperative relations between Russia and Turkey. Kazakhstan\u2019s initiative on Islamic rapprochement was favourably received at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Summit in April. Next year we will promote a high-level event under United Nations auspices to highligh the principles of international law, with a view to re-establishing the vital role of international organizations.\nAs a country with an impeccable record of religious tolerance, Kazakhstan pays particular attention to following up the decisions and recommendations of the triennial meetings of the Astana-based Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. We are grateful to the President of the General Assembly for convening a high-level conversation in May to address the role of political and religious leaders in building bridges and spreading messages of tolerance and peaceful coexistence. That event was followed by a high-profile gathering in Astana that focused on finding a balance between fighting terrorism and extremism, on the one hand, while ensuring individual rights and freedoms, on the other. Our efforts to promote interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance complement the work of other countries in the context of the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures 2013-2022, initiated by Kazakhstan.\nThe Manifesto underlines the importance of such principles as shared responsibility for peace and security, mutual respect and non-interference. Neglecting those principles has contributed to the destruction of the sovereignty and statehood of some States and the current humanitarian crisis triggered by unprecedented flows of refugees and migrants.\nKazakhstan is committed to strengthening United Nations peacekeeping capabilities, which are one of the pillars of the United Nations. My country signed the London communiqu\u00e9 of the United Nations Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial Meeting and confirmed its commitment to deploy a full unit with United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nWe welcome the establishment of the new Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System and fully endorse the creation of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations Strategic Force Generation and Capability Planning Cell. We also commend the comprehensive review of peacekeeping operations by the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s response. Kazakhstan is committed to ensuring that peacekeeping is effective. It has also contributed military personnel to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara and the United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nThis year Kazakhstan is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary of independence. I remember that back in 1991 some observers doubted Kazakhstan\u2019s ability to survive as a sovereign nation, given its multi-ethnic, religiously diverse population, unbalanced economy and huge material and moral burden in the form of a military infrastructure and a nuclear arsenal. That legacy was a challenge that we managed to turn into an opportunity. Over the past quarter of a century we have completed a journey from a non-existing country on the political map, to a stable middle-income nation and respected member of the international community.\nWe consider our election to the Security Council as international recognition of our sound and mature foreign policy and a deserved achievement of our independence. Indeed, the two-year tenure on the Security Council is a responsibility that we will shoulder with the utmost seriousness and pride. We will strive to contribute to the Council\u2019s work in the maintenance of international peace and security, preventive diplomacy, conflict settlement and post-conflict rehabilitation, peacekeeping, human rights, gender equality and international law. Central Asia will be represented on the Council for the first time in its history, and our membership is a chance to draw the attention of the Security Council to regional security issues. Our grand idea is to make the region a zone of peace, cooperation and security.\nIn that context, we believe that the situation in Afghanistan is essential to the security and stability of Central Asia. We have a genuine interest in promoting a political settlement and furthering the social and economic development of that country. Kazakhstan is investing more than $50 million to educate Afghan students, build schools and hospitals and provide humanitarian assistance. We pledged to provide a further $2 million to support the Afghan army. Together with Japan and the United Nations Development Programme, we are helping to improve the nation\u2019s civil-service capacity, with a special emphasis on gender equality.\nWe are keen, both within the Security Council and General Assembly, to promote our President\u2019s idea about creating a global anti-terrorism coalition or network. This is designed to strengthen and capitalize on synergies in the various counter-terrorism initiatives. Specifically, we are focusing on making all 19 counter-terrorism conventions universal and on developing a unified list of terrorist organizations, a unified extradition mechanism and a comprehensive legally binding international terrorism convention. Kazakhstan is actively engaged in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.\nWhen we take up our responsibilities in the Security Council next year, we will be ready to facilitate the further reintegration of Iran in political and economic areas. Our record of promoting a mutually beneficial deal on the Iranian nuclear programme is well known. My country helped break the deadlock on the Iranian programme by supporting a constructive dialogue among stakeholders and hosting two rounds of multilateral talks in Kazakhstan. In December 2015, Kazakhstan provided natural uranium to Iran as part of an International Atomic Energy Agency-monitored transaction, in support of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It is our intention to reinvest the political dividends we obtained to make further progress in this direction.\nWe hope that our regional expertise, together with our experience derived from chairing various regional bodies \u2014 including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia \u2014 will be an asset in addressing vital issues of peace and security on the Security Council agenda.\nKazakhstan is firmly committed to being part of the solution to the global issue of sustainability and climate change. Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which we pledge to ratify well before the end of 2016, are vitally important. Kazakhstan is therefore proud to host in Astana the international exhibition EXPO-2017 on the theme \u201cEnergy of the Future\u201d, which will showcase renewable energy sources relevant for both the developed and developing world. During EXPO-2017, we will also host the first- ever Organization of Islamic Cooperation summit on science and technology, a unique gathering designed to promote the modernization of the Islamic world.\nWith a view to promoting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 \u2014 on affordable and clean energy \u2014 we are working with the relevant United Nations agencies and research institutions to establish, under the auspices of the United Nations, an international centre for the development of green technologies and investment projects, as part of the EXPO-2017 legacy. We will continue to promote water, food and energy security in order to build a safer and more prosperous regional neighbourhood. As part of our commitment to SDG 2, relating to ending hunger, Kazakhstan hosted in a meeting in April of the OIC agriculture ministers and the inaugural session of the General Assembly of the Islamic Organization for Food Security, headquartered in Astana.\nWithin Central Asia, Kazakhstan strives to increase regional connectivity by giving priority to transport infrastructure projects and developing regional trade and economic integration. I would like to stress that commitment to sustainable development is an integral part of our domestic agenda. Our national development strategies and programmes are directly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, my country pursues a set of modernization reforms aimed at better, more efficient and transparent governance, rule of law, and civil service. The reforms focus on people-oriented Government and the creation of a middle-class society.\nKazakhstan remains committed to cooperating actively with United Nations human rights mechanisms and pays special attention to gender equality and the empowerment of women. By the end of the year, we will have adopted a new 2030 national strategy for gender equality.\nIn order to achieve the objectives of peace and development, Kazakhstan has offered to host a United Nations regional hub in Almaty, our southern capital, to focus on sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, disaster-risk reduction and resilience-building. We are aiming to complete the technical stages of this process within the next two years. Another United Nations regional hub, to promote civil service excellence, is already operational in Astana. The Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre plays an important role in streamlining regional efforts to counter drug trafficking.\nWe are convinced that, as the leading global institution, the United Nations needs stewardship of the highest quality, integrity, strength and moral authority.\nWe are closely following the deliberations of the Security Council on the selection of a new Secretary- General and hope that this individual will meet the highest expectations of all Member States. We express our deepest heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication, integrity and professionalism.\nModern challenges require that the Organization adapt to new realities in order to improve its effectiveness in dealing with international problems, preventing threats and overcoming challenges. United Nations reform should be carried out in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, on the basis of consensus and in the interests of all Member States.\nAs a trusted, objective and steadfast partner of the United Nations and all Member States, Kazakhstan will forge ahead with resolute determination in the pursuit of global peace and security. Undaunted, but approaching the task with healthy pragmatism, we will join others in stepping forward with new hope and optimism.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of Tuvalu, I bring greetings to the United Nations. We offer our prayers for those affected by the tragic loss of lives resulting from acts of violence here in our host country, the United States of America, and worldwide.\nLet me now add Tuvalu\u2019s commendations to the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji, who takes the helm at this session. While we appreciate the enormous task placed upon Fiji, we also have full confidence in the ability of Mr. Thomson and Fiji to steer us through the troubled waters of global oceans.\nAs the smallest Member of the United Nations family, Tuvalu continues to hold dear the noble values and principles of the United Nations. We very much hope that, as a result of the action of the United Nations, peoples of all races and creeds, of all countries big and small, particularly those whose very existence is threatened by human-induced strife, conflicts and especially by the impacts of climate change, will be saved.\nOver the past few days, the leadership of the Organization has been put to the test. Will we as leaders be able to provide a vessel, a canoe, buoyant enough to protect and save even the smallest islands of the planet? Will the canoe of the United Nations enable us to rise with the tide of progress and to sail through the surges of environmental insecurity and climate change, or will it sink us?\nTuvalu is immensely encouraged by the actions of world leaders in the past week, by the strong leadership of our Secretary-General and by the goodwill of humankind that continues to prevail. The adoption of the New York Declaration on the Movement of Migrants and Refugees (71/1), the compounding commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the many countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change have given us hope and renewed trust and confidence in the work of the United Nations and its ability to fulfil our hopes for the security, progress, and protection of our human rights.\nAnd now we must deliver on our words. Tuvalu applauds the strong leadership of the United States of America, other major greenhouse-gas emitters and the small island developing States (SIDS) \u2014 all of them, from the Pacific islands to other regions like the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean \u2014 to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change. But that is not enough. We must ensure that the Paris Agreement enters into force. It must be fully elaborated and operationalized as early as possible in order to achieve real adaptation and mitigation.\nAtoll nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives, Tokelau and all other SIDS \u2014 Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Samoa \u2014 are already suffering the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Many predict their total extinction if nothing is urgently done. That cannot and must not be allowed to happen. It would be shameful for humankind to allow such an eventuality. It would be shameful of us if we who are sitting in this Hall were not to take action to stop that from happening.\nTuvalu therefore appeals to all States to ensure that our collective efforts under the Paris Agreement keep the global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels, not only to fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, but to save us all and ensure our future survival. We pray that, through the United Nations, our humble voice will prevail on the conscience and goodwill of humankind to take real and urgent action.\nWe must also ensure that we take account of the protection of the human rights of those people displaced by the impacts of climate change. We need a legal framework to that end, and Tuvalu has proposed a United Nations resolution facilitating the establishment of just such a framework.\nOn behalf of Tuvalu, I pay tribute to the Secretary- General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his steadfast stewardship and his commitment to the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the peoples of the world. We have made tremendous strides under his leadership. As he leaves the United Nations, I wish him and his family well in their future plans.\nThe work of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session is no different than at past sessions, except for its urgency. Tuvalu welcomes the Secretary- General\u2019s report (A/71/1) and pledges its support to the theme, entitled \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. However, as noted in the Secretary-General\u2019s report, there is a real need for urgent actions to address the growing multiplicity and complexity of global challenges. It is vitally important that we address gender inequalities and ensure the rights of people with disabilities.\nAs regards peace and security, we applaud the work of the United Nations on many fronts and encourage further work to find long-lasting solutions to the long drawn-out conflicts in Syria, Ukraine and other troubled spots of the world. The loss of precious lives and misery are totally unacceptable and must be stopped.\nWe also encourage and welcome the normalization of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. However, we believe that it is important for the sake of peace and security that those relations be pragmatically translated into other areas of cooperation. We should recognize, of course, Cuba\u2019s humanitarian support and contribution \u2014 including its support to Tuvaluans in the form of scholarships and training, from which we have tremendously benefited.\nThe provocative actions displayed by the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Korea against the Republic of Korea and their potential implications for peace and security in the world, including in our own Pacific Ocean region, are totally unacceptable. We deplore those actions and urge that urgent steps be taken to completely suspend them at the earliest opportunity.\nWe are also concerned about the continuing denial of the right of the 24 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to be readmitted to United Nations membership so that they can participate in the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. We need to recognize that Taiwan is a vibrant democracy, which has recently elected and inaugurated a new President. Taiwan\u2019s genuine efforts in supporting various developmental and humanitarian undertakings, including in Tuvalu and many developing countries, need to be recognized as well. As we embark on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Taiwan\u2019s direct and indirect support will greatly help in leveraging existing partnerships. Taiwan is already involved in the work of many specialized United Nations bodies, such as the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. We therefore truly believe that Taiwan deserves international recognition and to become an active member of and participant in all the bodies of the United Nations system.\nIn the same vein, the principle of self-determination must also be respected and honoured. This great body cannot continue to ignore the ongoing violations of human rights in West Papua and that territory\u2019s desire to achieve self-determination. It must take them into account. It must not be blinded by the actions that are being carried out under the guise of the principles of non-interference and sovereignty. The United Nations must act in this matter and find a workable solution to give autonomy to the indigenous peoples of West Papua.\nWe are pleased that we now have a united front with respect to development, our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is underpinned by the key principles of interdependence, universality and solidarity. No country big or small, rich or poor, can achieve its SDGs alone. We must collaborate in durable and genuine partnerships on all the Sustainable Development Goals for the benefit of all. Our urgent focus, however, must be on the individuals at the margins of our societies, who can easily be left behind. We are indeed their beacon of hope. We must find practical and timely remedies that remedy the basic inequities and insecurities that persist. Our 2030 Agenda must deliver in ensuring the fundamental rights and welfare of all citizens in current as well as future generations.\nOur unity is founded on diversity. The United Nations can only be as effective as the sum of all positive national and regional actions put together. We are grateful for the work resulting in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) and believe that, for SIDS like Tuvalu not to be left behind, it is critical that the Samoa Pathway be fully implemented, and that proper provision for SIDS be made in all United Nations agencies and programmes.\nTuvalu has recently launched its own national strategy for sustainable development. It is called Te Kakeega III \u2014 meaning \u201cprogress\u201d in Tuvalu \u2014 and reflects the 2030 Agenda. Te Kakeega III is based on a theme entitled \u201cProtect and save Tuvalu\u201d and on the principles of local ownership, leadership, development and inclusiveness in decision-making, as well as on mutual trust and respect in working with our partners. We acknowledge the invaluable contributions of our development partners: Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the European Union and the Republic of China on Taiwan, together with all other bilateral and multilateral partners. The ultimate focus of Te Kakeega III is to fortify the resilience of Tuvalu and to reduce the vulnerabilities specific to its land territory, territorial waters, biodiversity and, most important of all, its people, through education, training and capacity-building. Tuvalu welcomes durable and genuine partnerships with the international community. All countries should advance together \u2014 though at a different pace, but progressively nevertheless. Each country must drive its own pursuits, in tune with its own capabilities and circumstances.\nFundamental gaps exist in the achievement of our Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially in the least developed countries that are also small island developing States, like my own country, Tuvalu. While poverty indices in our countries may have improved, our atoll nations will forever encounter development difficulties, and our level of vulnerabilities and fragility will continue to present us with unique challenges, however well-intentioned and well-planned our actions may be. Accordingly, special windows of opportunity for SIDS and the least developed countries are needed. We must not experience again the shortfalls that befell us under the MDGs. There must be genuine partnerships to deal with our unique and particular challenges.\nIrrespective of how well-intentioned or how well written our national strategies for sustainable development may be, our efforts and long-term survival and security will be seriously compromised unless urgent actions on climate change are taken at all levels. In our view, the cause and effects of climate change, including the threats to the survival of people worldwide, especially in SIDS, have been thoroughly explained, first in the plethora of United Nations documentation, and now in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The time for talking is over; it is now time to walk the talk and ensure the full elaboration and implementation of what has been agreed upon. We must ensure that our commitments under the Paris Agreement are all met.\nTuvalu has exerted every effort to contribute its voice \u2014 however small, however low \u2014 at the global level, and we are proud to have been part of the negotiations on climate change since the Rio Summit, and through thick and thin, and heat and cold, until the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with its successful outcome: the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Tuvalu was among the first countries to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement here in April.\nIn practical terms, we are not giving up. We will never give up. We are committed to reducing our greenhouse-gas emissions, as we stated in our Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, and by 2020 we shall have reached our target of 100 per cent electricity generation from renewable sources. Tuvalu has also established a Tuvalu Climate Change Survival Fund, using its own meagre financial resources, as a mechanism to show that we are serious in saving our people and enabling them to forever remain on the islands. The Survival Fund is now also a catalyst to engage in meaningful partnerships with the world.\nHowever, on our own, we are quite unable to afford the immense cost of adapting to the impacts of climate change. In that respect, we are deeply grateful for the support that has come bilaterally and from the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific, from various United Nations bodies in the Asia and Pacific region, as well as to the work of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and its Board. Tuvalu is currently one of only two SIDS in the Pacific with approved funding for adaptation work on the ground. We thank the United Nations Development Programme for partnering with Tuvalu in the development of our proposal. We also thank the two co-Chairs and Board members of GCF, and in particular our own SIDS representation on the GCF Board, for their favourable consideration. While we appreciate past assistance, we continue to need help in building our national capacity with respect to writing project proposals and reporting on progress. Let me assure both members and partners of GCF of Tuvalu\u2019s total commitment to ensuring the success of the approved project, and, of course, our full cooperation in future partnerships with GCF.\nWe are also very appreciative of the assistance that we received following Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015. However, we believe that there is a need to establish a more systematic mechanism to respond to disasters in small island development States, particularly those in the Pacific. We have proposed the establishment of a Pacific climate change insurance facility to help us receive assistance in a timely manner during disasters, without having to wait for partnerships and responses from partners.\nWe welcome the Oceans Conference to be held next year by the United Nations. The Pacific Island countries were instrumental in ensuring that oceans were included in the SDGs. The oceans provide the basis for our life. We therefore stress the need for collective action to properly address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, ocean acidification, the protection of biodiversity beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, and reforms to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, so as to protect the natural resources of our islands.\nInstead of singing the same old tune about good governance and political solutions, we need moral probity and soul-searching in dealing with the oceans. More than ever, we need the helping hand of Almighty God to guide us in our work. We must place God at the centre of our human efforts and the endeavours of the United Nations, to ensure that we successfully reach our destination together. Next week, Tuvalu will celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its independence. I ask Members to partner with Tuvalu and with God as we journey forward.\nI wish the Assembly success in reaching its goals the current session. I would like to reiterate that Tuvalu is fully committed to multilateralism. We believe that we cannot survive as a State without our United Nations. If we save Tuvalu, and SIDS, through the SDGs, particularly through Goal 13, on climate change, and Goal 14, on oceans, we will save the world. May God bless the United Nations. May God bless Tuvalu.\n"

        "file_text": "First and foremost, I bring greetings from His Excellency Sheikh Alhaji Yahya Abdul-Aziz Jemus Junkung Jammeh Babili Mansa, President of the Islamic Republic of the Gambia. I have the singular honour of reading out his statement, which is as follows:\n\u201cI bring fraternal greetings from the people of the Islamic Republic of the Gambia. I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session, an important and coveted position. His election is an eloquent testimony to his diplomatic acumen, and I can assure him of the support of the Gambian people, including the Gambian delegation here present, during his stewardship.\n\u201cIn the same vein, I wish to express deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the able and efficient manner in which he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. He will surely be remembered for the bold and major initiatives that were launched during his tenure as President. I also wish to extend sincere thanks to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in pursuit of world peace and economic progress over the past decade.\n\u201cThe world is at a crossroads. Since the previous General Assembly session, global peace and security have steadily deteriorated. Wars in the Middle East have intensified with alarming ferocity and unprecedented human casualties. In Africa, fratricidal wars in the Horn of Africa and in Libya pose the greatest threat to peace and stability on the continent. It is also a source of great concern that, despite the dangerous situations in Syria, Iraq and Libya, geopolitical interests continue to override humanitarian considerations. Unless concrete action is taken now, places like Aleppo, Mosul and Tripoli will soon cease to be human habitats.\n\u201cIn Africa, the protracted war in Somalia and the armed conflict between political rivals in South Sudan continue to blight the political landscape with untold human suffering. To complicate an already difficult situation, the impasse in Darfur and the frequent outbreaks of fighting in the Central African Republic and Burundi pose a serious threat to the civilian population, particularly women and children. I appeal to my brothers and sisters in those African countries to eschew violence and embrace reconciliation. As leaders of our people, we must always remember that history will judge us kindly only if we are magnanimous and devoted to the welfare and well-being of our people.\n\u201cWe cannot, of course, discuss international peace and security without addressing the lingering and unresolved Palestinian problem. The time has come, and is indeed overdue, for Israel to heed the overwhelming international consensus for a two- State solution as the only viable option that can ensure peaceful coexistence between Israel and Palestine.\n\u201cThe fragile peace that we enjoy is being seriously undermined by terrorism, which has assumed a global dimension, with the killing and maiming of innocent people. Today, we remember with sadness all the victims of terrorism who have been gunned down or maimed by bombs in Paris, Brussels, Bamako, Ouagadougou and Pakistan, inter alia, around the globe. It is therefore not an exaggeration to say that the world is in grave danger and that our human existence is under serious threat as a result. Collective action is the best way to fight that global scourge.\n\u201cWe are also greatly concerned that certain rogue politicians and pseudo-intellectuals with nefarious intentions are using the terrorism card to revive and propagate the notion of a clash of civilizations in which Islam is at war with the West. Their incendiary rhetoric lambasting Islam is unacceptable and can serve only to further polarize the world. The evil actions of a group of individuals claiming adherence to Islam cannot be taken to represent the convictions of the majority. There is no clash between Islam and the other Abrahamic religions of Christianity and Judaism, and there is certainly no war between Islam and the world. We condemn the renegade forces of terrorism and reject their campaign to create a nexus between terrorism and Islam.\n\u201cWhile we express anxiety over global insecurity, we must also focus on global economic conditions. A world that is marked by disparities and divided into zones of the affluent and the poor cannot enjoy durable peace and security. A world in which the conspicuous consumption of the few overshadows the abject poverty of the majority can only be a world of the powerful against the weak and of mutual animosity, mistrust and tensions. It is for those reasons and owing to our quest for a just and equitable world that we support the theme of the current session of the General Assembly: \u2018The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u2019.\n\u201cUnder the Millennium Development Goals, the Islamic Republic of the Gambia registered significant progress in its development agenda. I am happy and proud to state that hunger has been eradicated in our country, and the level of undernourishment has decreased from 13 per cent to 3 per cent. Our ultimate aim is to make agriculture attractive and profitable through our back-to-the-land policy, so that our people can work and live in dignity.\n\u201cThe future of Africa and indeed the world is inextricably linked to women as well as youth. Unfortunately, Africa is losing its young population because of migration. Our villages, towns and cities are being deserted as young people attempt to sail to what is wrongly perceived as the new El Dorado. Thousands have perished at sea, while thousands more are languishing in detention centres in Europe. That is an unprecedented depletion of our human resources and is bound to have disastrous consequences if allowed to continue. Given that disturbing phenomenon, international cooperation that would create jobs for youth should no longer be a slogan but a calculated strategy to keep them at home in gainful employment that could enhance their well-being and ensure the development of their countries.\n\u201cThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which the Islamic Republic of the Gambia signed together with the entire membership of the United Nations, is a landmark in our human evolution. It shows that, despite the imperfections of our Organization and our ideological differences, we are without a doubt capable of forging a global partnership to deal with a common danger. The negotiations were protracted and at times acrimonious, but in the end our common desire to save our planet prevailed. I wish to pay tribute to all the men and women who worked with dedication and sacrifice to ensure the success of the negotiations.\n\u201cAlthough the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was a success, the magnitude and complexities of other challenges facing the world have again brought into sharp focus the role of the United Nations and its capacity to address and advance international peace, security and development. That brings to mind the repeated calls of Member States for Security Council and broader United Nations reforms in order to enable the Organization to confront new and emerging challenges. The current composition of the Security Council, with five permanent members holding the veto power, is undemocratic, and the system is akin to minority rule. A situation in which five countries dictate the political and economic agenda and landscape of the world and can override international consensus by veto is indeed an anachronism.\n\u201cAfrica has the highest representation in the General Assembly, yet that continent, with over 1.2 billion people, has been denied the right to a permanent seat on the Security Council. The Islamic Republic of the Gambia therefore once again calls for the expansion of the Security Council to facilitate the allocation to Africa of two permanent seats with veto power and two other non-permanent seats.\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s legitimate demands have been well documented and articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. A well- structured and fully inclusive United Nations is what the world needs, and Africa is ready to take its rightful place and play a more pivotal and effective role in world affairs.\n\u201cThe significance of the reforms being envisaged calls for boldness and strong leadership. That is why we attach great importance to the election of the next Secretary-General. It is our hope that he or she will combine the legacies of his or her predecessors with the qualities of vision, fair play and equity. We always expect the new Secretary-General to be the people\u2019s Secretary- General and not the servant of the powerful five alone. The Secretary-General must be the voice of the voiceless and the chief advocate of the people of the world. We therefore look to the new Secretary- General to provide a visionary leadership that will settle old problems and disputes in a new era of peace, progress and prosperity.\n\u201cThe failure to address and settle age-old injustices is responsible for some of our major problems in the world today. I am referring to the historical injustices of slavery, the slave trade and colonialism. For far too long, slave-trading nations and colonialists have stubbornly defied good conscience, which would compel them to acknowledge the evil nature of their actions and atone for the atrocities that were committed against Africans and people of African descent. The African continent was plundered and pillaged, while millions of its inhabitants were trafficked to North America and the Caribbean. For centuries, they were exploited as slave labour in plantations, fuelling the industries of the slave-owning countries. Those acts of enslavement and forced labour provide empirical evidence that the economic foundation of the Western economies was built by enslaved Africans.\n\u201cThere is also irrefutable evidence that, despite their providing free labour, African slaves suffered discrimination, exploitation, torture and death at\nthe hands of their ruthless owners. The effects of the inhumane treatment that they suffered can be traced in their offspring. Even today, the slavery syndrome continues to impact and shape the lives and circumstances of Africans and people of African descent. To us who are affected by that phenomenon, slavery is a painful legacy. Yet there are those who question the merits of reparations.\n\u201cAlthough there have been pleas of innocence, there have also been notable pleas of guilt, as well. In 2006, for example, Tony Blair, the then British Prime Minister, apologized for his country\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade. The Assembly will recall that in 2007, Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London at the time, acknowledged that the wealth generated from the slave trade was responsible for the economic prosperity of England. But perhaps the best illustration of guilt was the proposal in the 1860s by General William Sherman of the United States Army that every freed slave in the United States should be given 40 acres and a mule as compensation. Sadly, President Andrew Johnson and the United States Congress rejected the idea at the time.\n\u201cThat was the beginning of the resistance against reparations. Yet, over time, we have had several global reparations. America, Britain, Germany and Japan have seen the need for and prudence of paying reparations for crimes committed against other countries and peoples. Germany, for example, we all recall, paid $60 billion to survivors of the Holocaust, and the Jewish Reparation Fund exists as well. The United States paid $20,000 each to 10,000 Japanese Americans who were sent to internment camps. Similarly, the United States has compensated native tribes for broken treaties. Japan has paid Second World War reparations to its former colonial possessions, such as Korea. It should also be noted that Britain has paid reparations to the Maoris of New Zealand for damage done during colonial times. More recently, Iraq has paid compensation to Kuwait for damages that it caused during its invasion and occupation of that country in 1990.\n\u201cWhy then should Africans and people of African descent be ineligible for reparations, after suffering the historic injustices of slavery, the slave trade and colonialism? Apart from historic precedents, there is merit, of course, in the call for reparations for damages caused during colonialism. Many of the problems confronting the former colonies today are the direct consequences of the actions of the former colonial Powers. A vivid illustration of how colonizers destroyed Africa is the way in which the continent was divided and shared out. The balkanization of Africa did not respect the territorial integrity of countries; nor did it consider tribal boundaries, or trade groups for that matter.\n\u201cThe division of Africa was arbitrary, taking into account the best interests of the colonizers. As a result, the geography of countries was altered. Children and kin became separated, customs and traditions destroyed and the most valuable artefacts carted away to Western museums. Africa was indeed torn apart, its people displaced and disintegrated, and the continent as a whole weakened forever. Reparations are therefore justified because they would demonstrate remorse and symbolize the healing of the wounds of colonialism. Reparations would also be an effective way to correct the global economic imbalances caused by colonialism.\n\u201cIt is therefore with a deep sense of mission and moral imperative that I ask the General Assembly to accept the case of slavery and colonialism as a global issue that should be addressed without equivocation. The African Union has given the matter its full support, and all well-meaning people around the world expect a favourable response from the international community to such a legitimate cause in preparation for the discussions and debates that would ensue. We recently concluded consultations at an international colloquium on the subject in Banjul, our capital, where a road map was presented on the way forward. The Group of African States at the United Nations is already working on a draft resolution on slavery, the slave trade, colonialism and reparations, to be introduced before the Assembly at this session. I appeal to all to support the adoption of that draft resolution and restore the dignity of our African ancestors.\n\u201cIn conclusion, I encourage the Assembly to use this opportunity to once again address the burning issues of our time. The people of the world are in need of durable peace. We need inclusive dialogue to resolve our problems and differences and forge partnerships that will improve our human conditions. The security of our world can be assured only if we establish genuine and friendly relations based on mutual respect for the dignity of our people and the sovereignty of our nations. I wish the Assembly a successful session.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to affirm El Salvador\u2019s highest and most decisive commitment to meeting and endorsing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Goals at the international level in order to make our country and the world a better place for its inhabitants.\nNine months ago, El Salvador became the first country in the world to sign a ground-breaking agreement with the United Nations system for long- term cooperation on the accelerated implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 15 nations around the world. Our objective, as partners in this ambitious initiative, is to make sustainable our country\u2019s efforts aimed at fulfilling the Agenda.\nTaking into account the deadline to achieve the SDGs, we have accordingly developed strategies in our five-year development plan, entitled \u201cEl Salvador: productive, educated and safe\u201d. Within the framework of that joint effort with the United Nations, it is essential to empower a diversity of actors in the implementation process. To that end, we are establishing the National Council for Sustainable Development, a joint mechanism between Government and civil society charged with consulting, arranging and coordinating implementation of the SDGs at the national level.\nIn El Salvador, we are convinced that the Sustainable Development Goals must become an agenda for society. They must become a vision and shared programme between Government, citizens, social organizations, churches, business people, universities and other pillars of society. Of course, we in the Government are the first who are called upon to show progress in implementing the Agenda. We are therefore working towards increasing the productive capacity of our country through creating an environment for greater private and public investment, supporting micro-, small and medium enterprises, raising the quality of education, and implementing special projects to support vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and rural populations, to create opportunities, employment and economic growth for them.\nWith regard to security, to achieve its goals and overcome its challenges, my Government is committed to reaching an agreement with all political parties, aimed positively at working together to resolve the short- term and tax problems that we are facing as a country. Furthermore, we are carrying out unprecedented efforts in the area of security, as we had set out to do a year ago when we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which states,\n\u201c[s]ustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security; and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development\u201d (resolution 70/1, para. 35).\nIn that context, I want to share with the Assembly the fact that the National Council on Citizen Security and Coexistence, involving all social and political sectors and stakeholders in the country, is moving forward with the implementation of the Plan for a Safe El Salvador in order to take steps to reduce all forms of violence and activities committed by criminal groups, such as gangs and traffickers in humans, weapons and drugs, which have brought so much suffering to our people. We have also undertaken extraordinary measures to prevent violence, which will be gradually expanded throughout the entire country once they have been implemented in priority municipalities. The actions carried out in the various aspects of the Plan for a Safe El Salvador has yielded results. Over the past five months, there has been an approximate 50 per cent reduction in homicides, as compared with the first three months of this year \u2014 although, of course, many challenges and difficulties lie ahead.\nI wish to reiterate that the Government of El Salvador remains fully committed to ensuring and protecting human rights. The commitment to human rights, democracy, the separation of powers, respect for the mandates of every State body and its decisions, transparency and the fight against corruption are today, for the Government of El Salvador, the cornerstone of any action it undertakes.\nI recall that my country promoted the recognition in resolution 70/1, adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, that migrants are a vulnerable group and that they incontrovertibly contribute to the economic development of the countries that receive them. El Salvador insists on the need for the international community and the organizations dealing with the immigration issue and defending the rights of migrants and human rights, in general, and in particular the United Nations, to meet the challenge with courage and guide the efforts of their agencies, funds and programmes to reinforce cooperation initiatives related to international migration in all its facets.\nMigration is a multidimensional phenomenon. It is as old as the history of humankind. In the particular case of my country, we are aware of the factors that motivate many Salvadorans to emigrate. National and other regional initiatives, such as the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, which we are implementing with Guatemala and Honduras, in cooperation with the United States of America, focus on key priorities, such as productive development, investment in human capital, security and the strengthening of institutions. As countries of origin, we are doing our part, but we also need the rights of our citizens in countries of transit and destination to be supported and, above all, ensured. In other words, only efforts aimed at improving the conditions within the communities of origin of migrant populations will change the situation in the medium and long term. As the Pope said in September last year, the wall is not a solution because it would only produce more hate.\nThere is no doubt that the maintenance of international peace and security is an absolute prerequisite for fulfilling the 2030 Agenda. It is therefore essential to reiterate that the threat to humankind posed by the continued existence of weapons of mass destruction is a cause for concern, and restate that their use or the threat of their use is a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, constituting a clear violation of international law and international humanitarian law.\nIn addition, we note with concern the attempts made to destabilize progressive Governments in our region, including the removal during her term of the President elected by the people of Brazil. Such practices are not only an affront to the rule of law, but also seriously hamper democracy, peace and the development of nations. We therefore stand against such measures. We call upon the international community to remain vigilant with regard to such actions and stay the course.\nIn that context, I would like to express particular solidarity with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros and the Venezuelan people, who, I trust, will find solutions through dialogue to the challenges facing them.\nSimilarly, our country firmly rejects any expression of intolerance, violence and terror by radical groups that are attacking the lives and the most fundamental rights of people \u2014 a phenomenon that has been striking various parts of the world over the past several years.\nEl Salvador, as a country that suffered from a civil war and the consequences of the Cold War, is particularly concerned about the conflict in Syria, which has been worsening and has had a disastrous impact on the country\u2019s entire social fabric, in particular for its children. It is crucial that the global leadership represented in this Hall, in particular from countries hosting refugees from the crisis, provide a coordinated and, above all, humane and united response for the families who are suffering from deracination, disease and the loss of their loved ones as a result of the war.\nWe also hope that the different sectors in Syria will, with the support of the international community and United Nations institutions, reach an agreement to put an end to the hostilities in its territory. We would also like to speak out for the other areas of the world, such as Palestine, Iraq and Libya, where it is urgent that conflicts be overcome and a stable peace achieved.\nIn the Americas, we have noted with satisfaction the progress made by Cuba and the United States in restoring their relations. However, we believe that this change will not bring the expected benefits to the people of both countries if the economic embargo is not brought to an end.\nIt is important to underscore the decisive role played by the United Nations in defending and promoting human rights worldwide, as well as in promoting international peace and security. That is why I want to thank the valuable support that the Organization has provided to El Salvador over the past 25 years, not only to improve the quality of life of Salvadorans, through the implementation of international cooperation programmes and projects, but also in other areas, such as strengthening democracy and the rule of law, inter alia. This shared vision came about thanks to the fact that El Salvador resolved the armed conflict of the 1980s through an intensive dialogue and negotiation process, which culminated in the signing of the Peace Agreement on 16 January 1992, for which we had the invaluable support of the United Nations.\nAllow me to underscore the fact that this is not only a historic milestone for El Salvador, but also a successful example of the workings of the United Nations system and can serve as a reference for resolving other conflicts. Accordingly, El Salvador has expressed its willingness to share its experience, as it did in the case of Colombia, which recently signed its definitive pact for peace and is implementing the agreements reached. We recognize and congratulate Colombia on this achievement.\nI wish to state that El Salvador is preparing to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Peace Agreement in January 2017. With the support of the United Nations, this will be an opportunity to once again strengthen the process of defining our national agenda which we have been working on with a view to deepening our goals. Looking ahead, El Salvador recognizes that the challenge of building a culture of peace goes hand in hand with a sustainable development agenda. As we see it, we cannot achieve sustainable development and democracy without peace, nor can we achieve peace without democracy and sustainable development.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my honour to address the General Assembly. Georgia has promoted the values of the United Nations since regaining its independence 25 years ago. In return, the United Nations has served as a partner for us \u2014 one of the oldest nations in the world \u2014 in developing a free and democratic State.\nTwenty-five years ago, few of us could have imagined that today Georgia would have transformed itself from a country ravaged by civil war into a dynamic European democracy. We have made great progress in building strong and effective State institutions; ensuring the freedom of civil society, the media and markets; and on social cohesion and the rule of law. And we are proud to be ranked as the fifth-freest economy in the world, thus ensuring openness and integration into the global market and equal opportunities for all people interested in doing business in Georgia.\nSince July, Georgia has been an associated country of the European Union and is harmonizing its policies, institutions, sectors and market rules with those of the European Union. We are an aspirant country to NATO, having the deepest and most comprehensive partnership with that organization of any nation. In the past few weeks, the United States Government, the European Union and NATO all took actions to emphasize that Georgia\u2019s future lies within the European and Euro-Atlantic community.\nAt its core, Georgia\u2019s foreign policy is aimed at building strong, mutually beneficial partnerships with the countries of our region and beyond. This path, chosen by our people, leads to more stability, security, peace and prosperity in our country and the region. The work never ends, however. Today, we are poised to thrive in a new millennium. We are building an innovation-driven community with all generations looking to embark upon an ever-brighter future. We are building a country that will ensure the unification of war-torn communities and abolish the Glienicke Bridge, versions of which still exist in the twenty-first century owing to the ongoing occupation of two of our regions, dividing peaceful societies on both sides.\nA year ago we unanimously adopted a universal plan to better the world by setting 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the 2030 Agenda. The much-needed transformative agenda for 2030 is indeed impressive. But let us be frank: despite the phenomenal blueprint of the Millennium Development Goals, we as an international community could not live up to the challenge. I welcome this year\u2019s focus on the transformative power of the SDGs. Let us make sure that in the next 15 years we do our utmost to really fulfil, if not all, at least a good majority of the 17 Goals. To do so, we need to succeed nationally and, at the same time, support others in meeting their national goals. We also must remember how interrelated the Goals are. We have to strive for peace and security by fostering development, and vice versa.\nOur Government has a vision on how to translate the Goals into national actions. This year, we launched a comprehensive four-point reform plan, which is about making the development of our country a success for each and every citizen of Georgia and for the development and stability of the region.\nEffective governance with transparent and accountable institutions is the key to building peaceful and inclusive societies and promoting sustainable development. Focusing on SDG 16, we have made a clean break with the past by prioritizing good governance. Two days ago, together with Estonia, the Republic of Korea and the United Nations Development Programme, my country organized a special high-level cross-regional event aimed at sharing success stories on implementing SDG 16. Let me reiterate that we remain committed to sharing our experience and extending support to those who are pursuing transformation.\nWithin Georgia, our goal is to ensure maximum inclusion of all stakeholders in the decision-making process. We have created several platforms for engaging in regular dialogue with civil society and private-sector representatives. In promoting good governance, our aim is to make all public services even more accessible for business, and we have launched an ambitious project known as the Tbilisi Business House in our capital. With its online platform, it will serve as a one-stop shop for businesses and as a front office for all Government bodies.\nCentral to good governance is fair and efficient tax collection. Georgia already has one of the lowest tax burdens in the world, but it is liberalizing its tax scheme further. To encourage business to invest in development, and therefore in new jobs, we have taken the decision to abolish a profit tax on undistributed earnings. Although it is a costly reform, it ensures the long-term sustainability of businesses and jobs. We are also improving the tax administration system by strengthening the role of the judiciary in decisions on tax inspections, thereby ensuring increased protection for the private sector.\nThe trend lines for Georgia continue to improve. The World Bank has just reported that Georgia\u2019s poverty rate dropped by more than 10 per cent in the period 2012-2014. That is a major accomplishment. In 2015, the unemployment rate continued to decline and is now at its lowest level in the past 12 years. Salaries and wages are up substantially, as compared with several years ago. Georgia\u2019s economy is growing despite the downturns all around us, and foreign direct investment is approximately 100 per cent higher than in 2012. That translates directly into jobs for Georgians. Georgia now ranks fourth in terms of the ease of doing business in Europe and Central Asia and is on the path to becoming a true start-up nation.\nIn the history of Georgia since its independence, there have never been so many opportunities for hard-working people to launch or grow their own businesses. Those with an entrepreneurial spirit have more chances to succeed than ever. We have launched several projects that ensure access to capital and infrastructure for people with innovative ideas, especially those interested in manufacturing or farming in Georgia.\nThe secret to fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals and building resilient and inclusive communities lies in unlocking the hidden resource that every nation has: its people. Accordingly, education is among our top priorities. We decided to tailor our education system to ensure that it delivers for each individual and for our society and economy as a whole. We want every graduate of a professional or higher-education institution financed by the Government to be able to find his or her place in a competitive labour market. We want an education system that is competitive and delivers quality education not only to Georgian citizens, but also to foreign students. The construction of two new private technical universities, at an estimated development cost of \u20ac1 billion, started this year. We will soon be able to offer some of the best education opportunities in our region.\nA healthy population is also key to further growth and development. Several years ago, we launched a flagship programme for universal health care. Today, all citizens of Georgia have heath-care insurance, thereby ensuring that medical care is a reality for hundreds of thousands of our citizens for the first time. We have also encouraged private investment in the health-care system, which has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in new private hospitals. A new national e-pharmacy system, which will streamline the delivery of medicines to patients, is now being tested.\nWith the help of our partners, special programmes to eradicate persistent diseases have been started. Georgia is poised to become one of the first countries to eliminate hepatitis C. We are especially grateful to the United States for its help with this initiative.\nGeorgia\u2019s development agenda is first and foremost about our citizens and their equal rights. We believe in the power of free citizens and the role of Government in ensuring freedoms and opportunities for them. Sustainable development is not possible without human rights, access to justice and effective, transparent, accountable and inclusive institutions.\nWe have taken major steps to bolster the rule of law. We overhauled the court system, the Office of the Prosecutor, judicial ethics and the responsibilities of attorneys. We gave more rights to defendants, and we ended impunity for Government officials. All Georgians are now equal before the law and can benefit from a judiciary system that has gone through several waves of reforms to reach higher levels of independence and professionalism. We are continuing the reform process of the judiciary to achieve the highest international standards. Today, Georgia ranks twenty-ninth on the Rule of Law Index of the World Justice Project, ahead of a number of old and new European Union members.\nOther important steps address a regrettable problem we inherited, that is, past human rights violations, with particularly egregious infractions in our prisons. We have acted swiftly and decisively to correct this. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment recently observed that the Georgian Government had turned this problem around since its election in 2012. The changes, he notes, are visible and quantifiable. We did this by putting in place legal and procedural mechanisms for combating the mistreatment of prisoners, including compensation for victims. We have enacted new anti-discrimination legislation. We have worked hard to achieve results in the areas of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. We are implementing a national action plan to ensure equal opportunities for persons with disabilities. But there is still more to be done. For that purpose, we have set in place a new long-term comprehensive human rights strategy and action plan.\nIn less than three weeks, we will be holding parliamentary elections in Georgia. Campaigning started more than three months ago, and this period has shown evidence of Georgia\u2019s real democratic development. With free and pluralistic media and political environments, a strong and vocal civil society and the relevant legislative and institutional framework, we are ensuring a free, fair and transparent election process. On 8 October, the people of Georgia will be the winners, and our democracy will continue driving our country to a sustainable future.\nSustainable development cannot be fully realized if it is divorced from the overriding issue of security. In Georgia, we are reminded of this every day by a harsh reality, namely, that 20 per cent of our country is occupied by foreign troops, territory that they took by force. Hundreds of thousands of people continue to be denied the right to return to their homes.\nWe are grateful for the support offered by resolution 70/265, on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia. It is time to translate this measure of support into action. Barbed wire fences installed by the occupiers divide Georgian families and communities. The populations in the occupied regions endure consistent ethnic discrimination and gross human rights violations. Their freedom of movement and their property rights are restricted. They are even denied education in their native languages. I condemn the recent act of holding elections for the Russian State Duma in Georgia\u2019s occupied territories, which is another part of Moscow\u2019s annexation policy. This all happens in the absence of any international monitoring, except for the limited involvement of the European Union Monitoring Mission, which has been denied access to the occupied territories.\nThe ongoing occupation and steps towards annexation remain the greatest existential challenge inherited by our Government. We have been seeking a workable solution with the Russian Federation. We have made some real progress in de-escalating tensions, but not all of Georgia\u2019s steps forward have been reciprocated. The Russian Federation has yet to honour even the European Union-mediated ceasefire agreement of August 2008.\nAgainst that backdrop, I would like to once again reaffirm that this conflict must be resolved peacefully, based on full respect for Georgia\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders. We will continue to address the concerns of people living in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions and to reconcile the war-torn communities across the occupation line. To that end, we will make all the benefits of our European agenda and all economic opportunities available to the people residing in the occupied territories. Our investment in the prosperous future of a united Georgia is additional stimulus for building confidence and reconciliation.\nWe will invest more than $5 billion in connectivity and infrastructure in the next four years. We will connect regions of Georgia with each other, as well as connect Georgia with the wider region. Thanks to Georgia\u2019s strategic location, our ports, roads and transport networks will be an important part of the ambitious and transformative Silk Road Development Plan connecting Europe to Asia. We are investing not only in infrastructure, but in policy platforms as well.\nThe Tbilisi Silk Road forum has proved to be a major success, attracting the involvement of 35 countries. In particular, we are honoured and excited to be working with China and the other nations of the Silk Road to provide a critical piece of a new trade and investment corridor that will benefit the entire world.\nWhen we talk about connectivity, we must not omit the Internet, perhaps the greatest driver of global cooperation. Therefore, we have started the development of a country-wide broadband system that will bring the benefits of the Internet to the most remote villages and farms. Georgia is proud to be listed among the top countries in Internet freedom.\nI am proud to be speaking to the Assembly on behalf of Georgia at a time when we are on the rise and at the centre of new developments connecting East and West. It is in this spirit that we seek to create a more secure and prosperous region, grounded in principles of sustainable development. We are working hard every day to take real actions that enhance the lives of our people while respecting their rights, their beliefs and their cultures. We look forward to continuing to work with the United Nations on achieving a shared vision for a better future.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of our proud Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate you on your election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and I thank you for the honour of addressing the Assembly.\nWe know that under your tenure, Mr. President, we will focus on striving for the key development goals for 2030 \u2014 people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. They represent broad global issues that are of particular concern to the small island developing States of the Caribbean region. Indeed, many of the problems facing our world today are linked and should be addressed holistically and multilaterally.\nToday in various corners of the world we see masses of people losing faith in the ability of established institutions to defend their interests and respond adequately to their needs. On an almost daily basis we witness an increase in acts of violence against innocent people. We look on, seemingly helpless, as large groups of people feel alienated and isolated in their own countries, with some of them forced to uproot their families and risk their lives to escape armed conflict in search of security and better opportunities.\nIt is clear that the causes of many of those problems are rooted in years of social neglect and entrenched economic inequities. We cannot resolve them by simply dismissing people\u2019s fears, stereotyping them or resorting to isolationism, xenophobia and protectionism. Our response must be to develop better partnerships and find common ground. Our global challenges demand that we build bridges, not walls. We must strengthen our commitment to multilateralism and cooperation. We must empower international institutions, civil society and the private sector to play a much greater role. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a perfect platform and framework for achieving that in partnership.\nEmpowering our young people is critically important to the transformation of our world. There is a common view that significant intervention is required in order to nurture aspiration, vision, leadership and a sense of civic responsibility. By providing opportunities for the constructive engagement of young people in critical matters that directly affect them and society, we can transform their frustration into meaningful empowerment. We should tackle head-on the increased incidence of youth-on-youth violence, which is invariably symptomatic of deeper societal issues. We cannot dismiss young people\u2019s evident despair. We have to adopt a multisectoral and integrated approach in order to find ways to make them see that violence is not the answer. In Saint Kitts and Nevis we have focused on job creation, skills enhancement, entrepreneurship, counselling and support to teenage mothers and the provision of other targeted social services.\nIt is important to note that on 4 July 2011, in keeping with our commitment to working more collaboratively to halt the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, the Caribbean Governments adopted the Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in my own country\u2019s capital of Basseterre. Those weapons have had devastating effects on many young lives and families. Saint Kitts and Nevis has now signed and ratified the Arms Trade Treaty, but we are still in need of much support.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, like so many small island developing States, remains inherently vulnerable, owing mainly to our small physical size, open economy, lack of economies of scale and, of course, small population. As we have seen time and again, a climate event that lasts only a few hours can wreak havoc on every single aspect of life on our islands. In the past we have asked that the international community address the issue of creating a strategy for the promotion of climate financing, and I once again reiterate that call. It is meaningless to say that billions of dollars are available for climate financing if the mechanisms for accessing the money are opaque, prohibitive and extremely difficult to penetrate. Again, I urge common-sense cooperation and partnership.\nWe are being further marginalized in the global financial system. Already in the Caribbean, as of the first half of this year, some 16 banks across five countries have lost all or some of their correspondent banking relationships, putting the financial lifeline of those countries at great risk. In our economies, which depend heavily on tourism and remittances as major factors in national development, such actions threaten to derail progress and undermine trade, direct foreign investment and the repatriation of business profits.\nFurthermore, we urge the Group of Seven, the Group of 20 and the international financial institutions to re-evaluate the methodologies used to assess whether and how a country qualifies for concessional support or access to certain types of international funds. The arbitrary classification of certain small nations, like Saint Kitts and Nevis \u2014 or Dominica, for that matter \u2014 as middle-income countries can never make sense when such a country might see its economy grow from 4 to 6 per cent in one year and then watch helplessly as nearly 100 per cent of its gross domestic product is wiped out in six hours of wind and rainfall from a tropical storm. Any new formula must include vulnerability and resilience indices.\nAs the Prime Minister in the CARICOM quasi- cabinet with lead responsibility for health and human development, I encourage this body and like-minded Governments to join me in re-energizing our efforts to fight non-communicable diseases and antimicrobial resistance, as well as communicable diseases like HIV/ AIDS. That fight is consistent with international efforts to meet our SDG targets. It serves to promote human security, improve individual choices and empower citizens. Saint Kitts and Nevis is grateful to the General Assembly for its continued advocacy, as well as to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS for its support to the Pan-Caribbean Partnership against HIV and AIDS, which has been declared an example of international best practices. We are also proud of the strides that we have made in reducing mother-to- child infection at birth by 97 per cent, and of our efforts to ensure ongoing and more cost-effective access to antiretroviral drugs and treatment and to reduce, through education, the stigma associated with the disease. But the battle is far from won. The Caribbean is still an area of very high prevalence.\nIt is essential to invest more in education in order to promote healthier lives and healthier food choices, as well as to help people make the right lifestyle choices, because several of the non-communicable diseases are preventable. In the long term, by implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, we can reduce the enormous costs of treatments associated with non-communicable diseases, which in turn could contribute significantly to meaningful economic development. It is worth the investment so that we can protect our most critical national asset \u2014 our people. In all our efforts, they matter most.\nMany of the difficulties that I have outlined have been made less burdensome because the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis have been fortunate enough to have benefited from some durable and meaningful partnerships, which have been integral to our efforts to build resilience, transform our country, modernize our economy, upgrade our workforce, educate our people and empower our citizenry. There have also been outstanding models of South-South cooperation worthy of emulation. For example, Cuba\u2019s support to the developing world in education and training, health care, agriculture and heritage development dwarfs the assistance of many economically advanced countries. Venezuela\u2019s Bolivarian energy outreach through Petro Caribe is an important model. There must be a greater commitment to share prosperity.\nAdditionally, in the past three decades, the tangible support of the Government and the people of Taiwan has been remarkable. Taiwan has stood shoulder to shoulder with the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis and remains steadfast in its commitment to support our determination to meet our people-empowerment agenda. Their help and solidarity touch almost every facet of life in our twin-island federation. Such advantages and benefits should not be limited to a few countries. I know that Taiwan is eager to share its progress and development successes with the rest of the world. I therefore recommend new opportunities for Taiwan and its people to be warmly welcomed and integrated into the international fraternity of nations as a global player whose commitment to the principles of democracy, peace and people empowerment can touch many more lives.\nThe future of our planet and our citizens cannot be outsourced to any one country or group of countries. In today\u2019s highly interdependent and integrated world, that future is our collective commons, demanding the full engagement of all countries and their citizens.\nLastly, I would like to sound a cautionary note. My Government, like most of the international community, believes that the recent nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea constitute a threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the world in general. Such nuclear tests violate Security Council resolution 2270 (2016) and the well- established regime relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands resolutely with those who seek to ensure a peaceful world free of the ravages of war and violence.\nDespite the many challenges we face, I am convinced that we can achieve our individual goals by working together as an international community to make the right decisions and triumph over adversity. Now is the time for a bolder and grander vision of partnership. As the peoples of the world, we joined together to celebrate our achievement in the SDGs. As the peoples of the world, we achieved a landmark climate deal at the Paris Conference on Climate Change. They are examples of what we can do working together for the ultimate benefit of all. Let us now, therefore, resolve to achieve even greater success in the years leading up to 2030.\n"

        "file_text": "Vanuatu would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session on his new role and function. We are proud that, for the first time in the history of the United Nations, one of our colleagues from the Pacific region has taken up that post. The President can be assured of my delegation\u2019s full support during his mandate and presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also wish to express our sincere gratitude to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for guiding the work of the seventieth session.\nI would also convey my heartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exceptional steering of the United Nations for the last decade. Throughout those years he has shown the leadership of a true world citizen. His accomplishments are many and are reflected in the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Those key successes will undoubtedly chart the future of humankind in the years to come. I wish Mr. Ban Ki-moon all the best in his future endeavours.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continue to be one of our most essentials tools for preventive diplomacy, as they fulfil our promise to humankind to respect the noble aspirations enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nToday, the world continues to face complex challenges. The role of the United Nations in that context, as expressed in the Charter of the United Nations, is more essential than ever. The global economy continually faces macroeconomic challenges plagued by uncertainty resulting from the ramifications of the global financial crisis and the weak prices for raw materials in recent years.\nThe precarious global economic outlook bodes poorly for future investments and global economic growth in the short and medium term. Global terrorism and instability in certain regions have given rise to some of the worst humanitarian crises that the world has ever known. Never before in the history of the United Nations have we seen such massive displacements of people. Forced migration has become a global crisis and reminds us of our shared responsibility to promote tolerance, good governance, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nClimate change is real. Its effects are being felt throughout the world. I congratulate the United States, China and the many other countries that have shown the world the path to take in ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I have submitted our ratification of the Paris Agreement to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and I am proud that small island developing States like Vanuatu are in the vanguard of the efforts to combat climate change. I would encourage the States that have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement to do so as soon as possible.\nThe ratification of the Paris Agreement will come to naught unless we take bold action to limit the long- term rise in average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C. That is a crucial test for our leaders in the near future, and we will fight for the true implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We urge all leaders of the world to join the small island developing States in increasing our mitigation efforts. We call for the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The destiny of the world and the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals depend upon our collective efforts.\nMy delegation believes in the lofty mandate of this international Organization, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. However, just like any organization, it must be adapted in correspondence with its objectives through significant reforms. As a key organ of the United Nations, the Security Council must strengthen its coherence in relation to the other bodies of the Organization.\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council, Vanuatu is in favour of improving transparency, accountability, relevance, inclusivity and effectiveness in order to manage the global contemporary threats and challenges that jeopardize peace and security. Such reforms must allow the Security Council to adapt to changes in the panorama of international security.\nVanuatu also continues to support the work of revitalizing the General Assembly. Those reforms must be systematic and respect the integrity of the United Nations. Therefore, leadership on the part of the most powerful States becomes necessary in undertaking reform in the face of the global challenges, which demand collective action. I would request that the Security Council and the General Assembly choose a person of impeccable ethics and integrity to be the next Secretary-General, who will continue to be a beacon of hope for all those without a voice.\nIn order to attain the SDGs, the major mandates of the United Nations and the United Nations system must be coordinated to work actively with regional bodies such as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, the Pacific Community and the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme. At the recent meeting of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in the Federated States of Micronesia in September, it was agreed that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and efforts to make the Pacific more resilient to climate change and natural disasters remain essential components of our journey towards a sustainable future for our region.\nOur oceans, our fisheries, gender equality, human rights, health care and education are all important priorities for our region. Given the coherence of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the global frameworks of the United Nations, an innovative partnership with regional organizations in the Pacific is important in order to transform the agreed intentions into significant actions for our people.\nVanuatu condemns all forms of nuclear proliferation and remains committed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We reaffirm our position in favour of a nuclear-free Pacific.\nVanuatu confirms its commitment to fulfilling the SDGs. We have made significant progress in integrating the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into our national plan for sustainable development. The protection of oceans specifically remains one of our foremost priorities within the framework of the SDGs. It is one of Vanuatu\u2019s aspirations to see ocean protection implemented immediately, and we welcome the fact that many States, both small and large, have taken measures to revive our oceans.\nI am pleased to declare that Vanuatu adopted its very first national ocean policy, which will help us to implement the objectives laid out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our current efforts, demonstrated by the political priorities of my Government, are in line with the SDGs and include a list of initiatives likely to accelerate the socioeconomic development of Vanuatu.\nThe mobilization of national resources to finance sustainable development remains one of the key priorities of our Government. We have recently created a committee to review our sources of revenue and expand our fiscal base. That represents a major reform, one of the most important since our independence in 1980. Such resources must supplement the financial assistance provided by our development partners and offer us new sources of financing in order to strengthen our institutions while developing our own human resources and infrastructures. All of those initiatives should improve our long-term economic productivity and help us to build a resilient economy. Such efforts should also help remove Vanuatu from the list of least developed countries in 2020, as well as from the grey list.\nIn spite of the ambitions and noble vision of my Government, my country is still facing insurmountable challenges that stretch beyond our means and that we cannot address on a national scale. That is also the case for many other vulnerable and fragile States. It is therefore essential that the international community provide assistance with reasonable criteria for extremely vulnerable countries facing external shocks. In the Global Climate Risk Index 2014, four of the Pacific island States are among the top 10 countries exposed to natural disasters in the world. Vanuatu remains at the\nhead of that list, despite our status as the most beautiful and happiest country in the world.\nThe magnitude of the devastating Category 5 severe tropical cyclone Pam had a major impact on our economy. Vanuatu faces one of the highest rates of sea- level rise that we have seen in the Pacific. Its impact has provoked a number of problems from epidemics to the multiplication of destructive insects, undermining food security and affecting the variability of precipitation. That situation has caused various problems for public health.\nThe presence of such extreme climate events has caused major harm to our infrastructure and economy. Climate change in Vanuatu is responsible for the loss of land to the sea and has also had a devastating effect on the food we eat, on our subsistence economy and, above all else, on the health of our people. Despite the fact that the Pacific is known for floods owing to the rise in sea levels, the disappearance of entire islands means that the people of Vanuatu will be forced to move inland. However, we will be transforming our ways of life to adapt to the climate change that is already affecting the population.\nAlthough we profoundly appreciate the assistance provided by the international community in coordinating financial aid to help rebuild in the aftermath of natural disasters, the actions of non-governmental organizations, particularly international humanitarian organizations, have often proved ineffective. The non-governmental organizations do not always respect the priorities of the country with regard to rebuilding and recovery. That is a major challenge that all too often results in their attention being redirected to other needs that are not the immediate ones of the affected population. The Government could have more responsibility if the assistance funds were processed through the governmental system.\nThe inclusion of vulnerable groups, such as people with special needs and girls and women, is an important priority for my Government. Our policy is rooted in inclusive economic growth. The scourge of sexual and domestic violence against women and girls is still a major challenge, and if no action is taken, the outlook for global development is uncertain. My country will certainly take the necessary steps to confront that challenge.\nAlthough our historical past has seen little change, my Government is in slow but steady consultations on constitutional reform in order to ensure that, in future, women play a more active role in making decisions and influencing policies within our Parliament. That major reform will have its day.\nMy country will continue its cooperation with the United Nations in the area of global peace and security. We cannot guarantee development and the right to a life of dignity for our people in a world torn by wars and ravaged by conflicts. We all must contribute to efforts to maintain peace and global security in the world we live in. Vanuatu is proud of having members serve in peacekeeping forces under the United Nations banner in Haiti and in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We are ready to send more troops in the future if we are called to do so.\nDecolonization remains a key issue that requires our collective efforts if we are to make the self- determination of peoples a reality, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We must express our solidarity and our commitment to eradicate colonialism in all its forms. In that regard, I am pleased to note that the United Nations is aiding New Caledonia with its electoral lists. I hope that the controversies related to the electoral lists will be resolved amicably among the concerned parties and that the next referendum will yield fair, transparent and pacifying results. Going forward, it is for the Caledonians to freely choose their future self-determination status.\nWe, the leaders of the Pacific islands, during the recent meeting of the Forum in the Federated States of Micronesia, accepted New Caledonia and French Polynesia as full members of the Pacific Islands Forum, in spite of their status as non-independent territories. This constitutes a major step on the path to regional integration and the unification of the Pacific island countries, leaving no one behind in the fight against the impact of climate change and illegal fishing or in the creation of economic opportunities through trade and more open economic relationships.\nThe issue of human rights must remain at the top of the United Nations agenda. The Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, reminded us in 2012 that human rights are inalienable and constitute a fundamental principle of the United Nations. As Members of the United Nations, it is our duty to demand that those words be translated into concrete actions.\nThe issue of human rights for the peoples in West Papua remains unresolved. I stand on this rostrum, as did my predecessors with the same moral conviction, to call on the United Nations to take concrete measures to resolve that question and fellow leaders have supported the plea of the West Papuans. The United Nations should not close its eyes to the abuses of human rights in the province of West Papua. The people of West Papua have turned to the United Nations for a glimmer of hope \u2014 a hope for freedom to exercise of their rights in their own territory and to freely assert their identity. I urge the United Nations to include this issue in its Human Rights Up Front initiative.\nIn conclusion, as we begin an era of sustainable development, the importance of working together becomes more evident and urgent. The implementation of international agreements will not be an easy matter, given the complex global challenges and the hostile environment in which we live. However, everything is possible and we must believe that. We must ensure that the promise of the Charter of the United Nations is respected for those who need it most. Our role is one of bridging the gap between the rhetoric and the action in order to ensure that no one is left behind.\n"

        "file_text": "What I am about to say is going to shock everyone \u2014 Israel has a bright future at the United Nations. I know that hearing that from me must surely come as a surprise, because year after year I have stood at this very rostrum and slammed the United Nations for its obsessive bias against Israel. And the United Nations has deserved every scathing word \u2014 for instance, for the disgrace of the General Assembly last year, which adopted 20 resolutions against the democratic State of Israel and a grand total of three resolutions against all the other countries on the planet. Israel, 20; the rest of the world, three.\nAnd what about the joke called the United Nations Human Rights Council, which each year condemns Israel more than all the countries of the world combined? As women are being systematically raped, murdered and sold into slavery across the world, which is the only country that the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women chose to condemn this year? Yes, Israel. Israel, where women fly fighter jets, lead major corporations, head universities, preside \u2014 twice \u2014 over the Supreme Court, and have served as Speaker of the Knesset and Prime Minister. And that circus continues at UNESCO, the United Nations body charged with preserving world heritage. This is hard to believe, but UNESCO just denied the 4,000-year connection between the Jewish people and its holiest site, the Temple Mount. That is just as absurd as denying the connection between the Great Wall of China and China.\nThe United Nations, which began as a moral force, has become a moral farce. Therefore, when it comes to Israel at the United Nations, one might well think that nothing will ever change. Well, think again. Everything will change, and a lot sooner than one might think. The change will happen in this Hall, because back home Governments are rapidly changing their attitudes towards Israel. Sooner or later, that is going to change the way everyone votes on Israel at the United Nations.\nMore and more nations in Asia, in Africa and in Latin America see Israel as a potent partner in fighting the terrorism of today and in developing the technology of tomorrow. Today, Israel has diplomatic relations with over 160 countries, nearly double the number from when I served here as Israel\u2019s Ambassador some 30 years ago. Those ties are getting broader and deeper every day. World leaders increasingly appreciate that Israel is a powerful country with one of the best intelligence services on Earth. Because of our unmatched experience and proven capabilities in fighting terrorism, many Governments will seek our help in keeping their countries safe.\nMany also seek to benefit from Israel\u2019s ingenuity in agriculture, in health, in water, in cybersecurity and in the fusion of big data, connectivity and artificial intelligence \u2014 that fusion that is changing our world in every way. Israel leads the world in recycling wastewater. We recycle about 90 per cent of our wastewater. How remarkable is that? Given that the next country on the list recycles only about 20 per cent of its wastewater, Israel is a global water Power. If we have a thirsty world, and we do, there is no better ally than Israel.\nHow about cybersecurity? That is an issue that affects everyone. Israel accounts for one tenth of 1 per cent of the world\u2019s population, yet last year we attracted some 20 per cent of the global private investment in cybersecurity. If we digest that number, we see that Israel is punching a whopping 200 times above its weight. Therefore, Israel is also a global cybersecurity Power. If hackers are targeting banks, planes, power grids and just about everything else, Israel can offer indispensable help. Governments are changing their attitudes towards Israel because they know that Israel can help them protect, feed and improve the lives of their people.\nThis summer, I had an unbelievable opportunity to see that change vividly during an unforgettable visit to four African countries. That was the first visit to Africa by an Israeli Prime Minister in decades. Later today, I will be meeting with leaders from 17 African countries. We will discuss how Israeli technology can help them in their efforts to transform their countries. In Africa, things are changing. In China, India, Russia and Japan, attitudes towards Israel have changed as well. Those powerful nations know that, despite Israel\u2019s small size, it can make a big difference in many areas that are important to them.\nBut now I am going to surprise everyone even more. The biggest changes in attitudes towards Israel is taking place elsewhere. It is taking place in the Arab world. Our peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan continue to be anchors of stability in the volatile Middle East. For the first time in my lifetime, many other States in the region recognize that Israel is not their enemy. They recognize that Israel is their ally. Our common enemies are Iran and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Our common goals are security, prosperity and peace.\nI believe that, in the years ahead, we will work together to achieve those goals, work together openly. Therefore, Israel\u2019s diplomatic relations are undergoing nothing less than a revolution. But in that revolution we never forget that our cherished alliance, our deepest friendship, is with the United States of America, the powerful and the most generous nation on Earth. Our unbreakable bond with the United States of America transcends parties and politics. It reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support for Israel among the American people, support which is at record highs and for which we are deeply grateful.\nThe United Nations denounces Israel; the United States supports Israel. And a central pillar of that defence has been America\u2019s consistent support for Israel at the United Nations. I appreciate President Obama\u2019s commitment to that long-standing United States policy. In fact, the only time that the United States cast a Security Council veto during the Obama presidency was against an anti-Israel draft resolution in 2011 (see S/PV.6484). As President Obama rightly declared at this rostrum, peace will not come from statements and resolutions at the United Nations. I believe the day is not far off when Israel will be able to rely on many countries to stand with us at the United Nations. Slowly but surely, the days when United Nations Ambassadors reflexively condemn Israel are coming to an end.\nToday\u2019s automatic majority against Israel at the United Nations reminds me of the incredible story of Hiroo Onada, who was a Japanese soldier sent to the Philippines in 1944. He lived in the jungle. He scavenged for food. He evaded capture. Eventually he surrendered, but that did not happen until 1974, some 30 years after the end of the Second World War. For decades, Hiroo refused to believe the war was over. As Hiroo was hiding in the jungle, Japanese tourists were swimming in pools in American luxury hotels in nearby Manila. Finally, mercifully, Hiroo\u2019s former commanding officer was sent to persuade him to come out of hiding. Only then did Hiroo lay down his arms.\nI have one message for those present here today, that is, that they too should lay down their arms. The war against Israel at the United Nations is over. Perhaps some of those present do not know it yet, but I am confident that one day in the not too distant future they will also get the message from their leaders informing them that the war against Israel at the United Nations has ended. Yes, I know, there might be a storm before the calm. I know there is talk about ganging up on Israel at the United Nations later this year.\nGiven the United Nations history of hostility towards Israel, does anyone really believe that Israel will let the United Nations determine our security and our vital national interests? We will not accept any attempt by the United Nations to dictate terms to Israel. The road to peace runs through Jerusalem and Ramallah, not through New York. But regardless of what happens in the months ahead, I have total confidence that, in the years ahead, the revolution in Israel\u2019s standing among the nations will finally penetrate this Hall of nations.\nI have so much confidence, in fact, that I predict that a decade from now an Israeli Prime Minister will stand right here where I am standing and actually applaud the United Nations. But I want to ask: why do we have to wait a decade? Why keep vilifying Israel? Perhaps because some do not appreciate that the obsessive bias against Israel is not just a problem for my country, it is a problem for the other countries too. If the United Nations spends so much time condemning the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, it has far less time to address war, disease, poverty, climate change and all of the other serious problems that plague the planet.\nAre the half-million slaughtered Syrians helped by Member States\u2019 condemnation of Israel? The same Israel that has treated thousands of injured Syrians in our hospitals, including a field hospital that I built right along the Golan Heights border with Syria. Are the gays hanging from cranes in Iran helped by acts to denigrate Israel? That same Israel where gays march proudly in our streets and serve in our Parliament, including, I am proud to say, in my own Likud party. The starving children in North Korea\u2019s brutal tyranny, are they helped by the demonization of Israel? Israel, whose agricultural know-how is feeding the hungry throughout the developing world? The sooner the United Nations obsession with Israel ends, the better \u2014 the better for Israel, the better for other countries, the better for the United Nations itself.\nIf United Nations habits die hard, Palestinian habits die even harder. President Abbas just attacked, from this rostrum, the Balfour Declaration. He is preparing a lawsuit against Britain for that declaration from 1917. That is almost 100 years ago \u2014 talk about being stuck in the past. The Palestinians may just as well sue Iran for the Cyrus Declaration, which enabled the Jews to rebuild our Temple in Jerusalem 2,500 years ago. Come to think of it, why not a Palestinian class action suit against Abraham for buying that plot of land in Hebron where the fathers and mothers of the Jewish people were buried 4,000 years ago? It is as absurd as that. To sue the British Government for the Balfour Declaration? Is he kidding? And that is taken seriously here?\nPresident Abbas attacked the Balfour Declaration because it recognized the right of the Jewish people to a national home in the land of Israel. When the United Nations supported the establishment of a Jewish State in 1947, it recognized our historical and our moral rights to our homeland. Yet today, nearly 70 years later, the Palestinians still refuse to recognize those rights \u2014 not our right to a homeland, not our right to a State, not our right to anything. And that remains the true core of the conflict: the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish State in any boundary. One can see that the conflict is not about the settlements. It never was.\nThe conflict raged for decades before there was a single settlement, when Judea, Samaria and Gaza were all in Arab hands. The West Bank and Gaza were in Arab hands, and they attacked us again and again and again. And when we uprooted all 21 settlements in Gaza and withdrew from every last inch of Gaza, we did not get peace from Gaza \u2014 we got thousands of rockets fired at us from Gaza.\nThe conflict rages because for the Palestinians the real settlements they are after are Haifa, Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Keep in mind, the issue of settlements is a real one, and it can and must be resolved in final-status negotiations. But this conflict has never been about the settlements, nor about establishing a Palestinian State. It has always been about the existence of a Jewish State, a Jewish State within any boundaries. Israel is ready, as am I, to negotiate all final-status issues. However, one thing I will never negotiate is our right to our State, the one and only Jewish State. Change may be coming sooner than I thought.\nHad the Palestinians said yes to a Jewish State in 1947, there would have been no war, no refugees and no conflict. When the Palestinians finally say yes to a Jewish State, we will be able to end our conflict once and for all.\nThe real tragedy is that the Palestinians are not only trapped in the past, but their leaders are poisoning the future. By way of illustration, I want the Assembly to imagine a day in the life of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy named Ali. Ali wakes up before school and goes to soccer practice with a team named after Dalal Mughrabi, a Palestinian terrorist responsible for the murder of a busload of 37 Israelis. At school, Ali attends an event sponsored by the Palestinian Ministry of Education honouring Baha Alyan, who last year murdered three Israeli civilians.\nOn his walk home, Ali looks up at a towering statue erected just a few weeks ago by the Palestinian authorities to honour Abu Sukar, who detonated a bomb in the centre of Jerusalem, killing 15 Israelis. When Ali gets home, he turns on the television and sees an interview with a senior Palestinian official, Jibril Rajoub, who says that, if he had a nuclear bomb, he would have detonated it over Israel that very morning.\nAli then turns on the radio, and he hears President Abbas\u2019 adviser Sultan Abu al-Einein urging Palestinians to \u201cslit the throats of Israelis wherever you find them\u201d. Ali checks his Facebook, and he sees a recent post by President Abbas\u2019 Fatah party, calling the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 a \u201cheroic act\u201d. On YouTube, Ali watches a clip of President Abbas himself saying \u201cwe welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem\u201d.\nOver dinner, Ali asks his mother what would happen if he killed a Jew and went to an Israeli prison. She tells him that he would be paid thousands of dollars each month by the Palestinian authorities. In fact, she tells him that the more Jews he killed, the more money he would get. When he gets out of prison, Ali would be guaranteed a job with the Palestinian authorities.\nAll of that is not just a story, it is real. It happens every day, all the time. Sadly, Ali represents hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children who are indoctrinated with hate during every moment of every hour. That is child abuse. Imagine if it were our children undergoing such brainwashing. Imagine what it takes for a young boy or girl to break free of such a culture of hate. Some do, but far too many do not.\nHow can any of us expect young Palestinians to support peace when their leaders poison their minds against peace? In Israel we do not do that; we educate our children for peace. In fact, my Government recently launched a pilot programme to make the study of Arabic mandatory for Jewish children, so that we can better understand each other, and so that we can live together side by side, in peace. Of course, like all societies, Israel has fringe elements. But it is our response to those fringe elements that makes all the difference.\nLet us consider the tragic case of Ahmed Dawabsha. I shall never forget visiting Ahmed in the hospital, just hours after he was attacked. This little boy \u2014 a baby \u2014 was badly burned. Ahmed was the victim of a horrible terrorist attack perpetrated by Jews. He lay bandaged and unconscious as Israeli doctors worked around the clock to save him. No words could bring comfort to this boy or to his family. Nevertheless, as I stood by his bedside, I told his uncle: \u201cThis is not our people. This is not our way\u201d. I then ordered extraordinary measures to bring Ahmed\u2019s assailants to justice, and today the Jewish citizens of Israel accused of attacking the Dawabsha family are in jail awaiting trial.\nFor some, that story shows that both sides have their extremists and that both sides are equally responsible for our seemingly endless conflict. However, what Ahmed\u2019s story actually proves is the very opposite. It illustrates the profound difference between our two societies. While Israeli leaders condemn terrorists \u2014 Arabs and Jews alike \u2014 Palestinian leaders celebrate terrorists. While Israel jails the handful of Jewish terrorists among us, the Palestinians pay thousands of terrorists among them.\nI therefore call upon President Abbas to tell him that he has a choice to make. He can continue to stoke hatred, as he did today, or he can finally confront hatred and work with me to establish peace between our two peoples. I know that many of you have given up on peace, but I want it to be known that I have not given up on peace.\nI remain committed to a vision of peace based on two States, for two peoples. I believe, more than ever before, that changes taking place in the Arab world today offer a unique opportunity to advance that peace. In that connection, I commend President Al Sisi of Egypt for his efforts to advance peace and stability in our region.\nIsrael welcomes the spirit of the Arab Peace Initiative and welcomes a dialogue with Arab States to advance a broader peace. I believe that, in order for that broader peace to be fully achieved, the Palestinians have to be part of it. I am ready to begin negotiations to achieve that today without any further delay.\nAlthough President Abbas spoke here an hour ago, would it not be better if, instead of speaking past each other, we were speaking to one another? I invite President Abbas to speak to the Israeli people at the Knesset in Jerusalem, instead of railing against Israel at the United Nations in New York. I would gladly come to speak to the Palestinian Parliament in Ramallah.\nWhile Israel seeks peace with all our neighbours, we also know that peace has no greater enemy than the forces of militant Islam. The bloody trail of such fanaticism runs through all the continents represented here. It runs through Paris and Nice, Brussels and Baghdad, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Minnesota and New York. From Sydney to San Bernadino, so many have suffered its savagery: Christians and Jews, women and gays, Yazidis and Kurds and many others.\nYet the heaviest price of all has been paid by innocent Muslims \u2014 hundreds of thousands mercilessly slaughtered, millions turned into desperate refugees, tens of millions brutally subjugated. The defeat of militant Islam will therefore be a victory for all humankind. It will especially be a victory for the many Muslims who seek a life without fear \u2014 a life of peace, a life of hope.\nTo defeat the forces of militant Islam, we must fight them relentlessly. We must fight them in the real world. We must fight them in the virtual world. We must dismantle their networks, disrupt their funding channels and discredit their ideology. We can defeat them, and we will defeat them. Medievalism is no match for modernity. Hope is stronger than hate. Freedom is mightier than fear. We can do it.\nIsrael fights the fateful battle against the forces of militant Islam every day. We keep our borders safe from the Islamic State. We prevent the smuggling of game-changing weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon. We foil Palestinian terror attacks in the West Bank. We deter missile attacks from Hamas-controlled Gaza.\nThat is the same Hamas terror organization that cruelly \u2014 unbelievably cruelly \u2014 refuses to return three of our citizens and the bodies of our fallen soldiers, Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. Hadar Goldin\u2019s parents, Leah and Simcha Goldin, are here with us today. They have one request: to be able to bury their beloved son in Israel. All they ask for is one simple thing: to be able to visit the grave of their fallen son, Hadar, in Israel, but Hamas refuses. Hamas could not care less. I implore everyone to stand with Hadar\u2019s parents, with us, with all that is decent in our world against the inhumanity of Hamas, which represents all that is indecent and barbaric. Hamas breaks every humanitarian rule in the book. Throw the book at them.\nThe greatest threat to my country, to our region and ultimately to our world remains the militant Islamic regime of Iran. Iran openly seeks Israel\u2019s annihilation. It threatens countries across the Middle East. It sponsors terror worldwide. This year, Iran has fired ballistic missiles in direct defiance of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). It has expanded its activities in Iraq, Syria and in Yemen. Iran, the world\u2019s foremost sponsor of terrorism, continues to build its global terror network. That terror network now spans five continents. My point is as follows: the threat that Iran poses to all of us is not behind us; it is in front of us. In the coming years, there must be a sustained and united effort to push back against Iran\u2019s aggression and terror. With the nuclear constraints on Iran one year closer to being removed, let me be clear: Israel will not allow the terrorist regime in Iran to develop nuclear weapons \u2014 not now, not in a decade, not ever.\nI stand before the Assembly at a time when Israel\u2019s former President Shimon Peres is fighting for his life. Shimon is one of Israel\u2019s founding fathers, one of its boldest statesman and one of its most respected leaders. I know that the Assembly will join me and the people of Israel in wishing him a speedy recovery. I have always admired Shimon\u2019s boundless optimism. Like him, I am filled with hope.\nI am filled with hope because Israel is capable of defending itself by itself against any threat. I am filled with hope because the valour of our fighting men and women is second to none. I am filled with hope because I know that the forces of civilization will ultimately triumph over the forces of terror. I am filled with hope because in the age of innovation, Israel, the innovation nation, is thriving like never before. I am filled with hope because Israel works tirelessly to advance equality and opportunity for all its citizens: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, everyone. I am filled with hope because despite all the doubters, I believe that in the years ahead Israel will forge a lasting peace with all our neighbours.\nI am hopeful about what Israel can accomplish because I have seen what Israel has accomplished. In 1948, the year of Israel\u2019s independence, our population was 800,000. Our main export was oranges. People said that we were too small, too weak, too isolated and too demographically outnumbered to survive, let alone thrive. The sceptics were wrong about Israel then, and the sceptics are wrong about Israel now. Israel\u2019s population has grown tenfold. Our economy has grown fortyfold. Today, our biggest export is technology. Israeli technology powers the world\u2019s computers, cell phones, cars and so much more.\nThe future belongs to those who innovate, and that is why the future belongs to countries like Israel. Israel wants to form partnerships in seizing that future, and so I call on all those present to embrace Israel, to cooperate and dream with Israel. Dream of the future that we can build together \u2014 a future of breathtaking progress, a future of security, prosperity and peace, a future of hope for all humankind, a future where even at the United Nations, even in this Hall, Israel will finally, inevitably, take its rightful place among the nations.\n"

        "file_text": "This year, the people of Eritrea have been celebrating the silver jubilee of their country\u2019s independence in 1991. During the difficult years of the war for independence, very few people believed that Eritreans and their leadership were capable of that historic achievement, as the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them.\nUnlike in other liberation struggles, it was both super-Powers \u2014 the United States and the Soviet Union, and not just one or the other \u2014 that sought to crush by armed force Eritrea\u2019s aspirations for self- determination. Nevertheless, the Eritrean people and their liberation movement \u2014 the Eritrean People\u2019s Liberation Front, the predecessor of today\u2019s People\u2019s Front for Democracy and Justice \u2014 believed in the justness of their cause and in their own determination and capability to win the war fair and square and prevail in the unequal battle.\nThe post-independence struggle to build a nation has also been complex and difficult. We have been compelled to commit precious human and economic resources to defend ourselves against wars of aggression and subversion. We have suffered the occupation of our sovereign territory in violation of international law and a binding international arbitration ruling. We have been subjected to incessant hostility, sanctions, economic, financial and diplomatic pressures, as well as armed attacks and psychological warfare.\nOur people, particularly our youth, were targeted through policies that actively encouraged their migration, leading to much suffering and loss of life at the hands of human traffickers. The inevitable outcome of those policies was then presented as evidence against Eritrea. No less an authority than President Obama of the United States stated publicly that he had \u201crenewed sanctions on some of the worst abusers, including... Eritrea\u201d. And he added, \u201cWe are partnering with groups that help women and children escape from the grip of their abusers\u201d. The objective was regime change, as a prelude to bringing Eritrea to its knees.\nIn the face of that concerted onslaught, few gave Eritrea a fighting chance. We were routinely written off, and our imminent collapse was predicted with regularity. However, once again, resilient Eritrea and Eritreans at home and abroad were able to forge the capability to resist the onslaught on their nation and protect their hard-won freedom through their patriotism, cohesion, sheer determination and sacrifices. After a difficult decade and a half, Eritrea is now on the rise.\nThe majority of the Millennium Development Goals have been achieved. The economy is rebounding. Infrastructure is being built. Favourable conditions are being created to provide youth with ample opportunities for quality education, vocational skills, decent living conditions and active political participation. The country\u2019s regional and international engagement is growing. The counter-productive policy of isolating Eritrea is slowly but surely failing. The pressures, coercion and hostility that Eritrea has faced are by no means exceptional or distinctive. In our region, the Horn of Africa, they are but one element of a misguided policy pursued for over a quarter of a century that has fuelled violence, conflict, instability and fragmentation, as well as extremism and terrorism.\nThroughout the world there are many nations that cherish dignity and independent decision-making, that uphold the sovereign equality of nations, that seek to chart political and economic paths suited to their conditions, and that seek to benefit from their human and natural resources. They have faced the wrath of those who wish to cling to their domination and privileges, and resort to all manner of coercion and subversion, including sanctions, blockades and armed interventions. Unsustainable policies of greed and pillage and the reckless resort to unilateral pressure and force in order to secure unilateral advantage, instead of seeking common ground and mutual interests, are leading the world down an extremely dangerous path. The very survival of the planet and humankind is in grave danger owing to unsustainable systems of production and consumption and the attendant large-scale wastage. In that context, Eritrea wishes to point out that the pending decision by the United States to adopt legislation that nullifies national sovereign immunity constitutes a violation of international law and a dangerous precedent with grave implications. Although the challenges and dangers we face are grave and stark, our world is still full of possibilities and opportunities.\nThe global balance of power and wealth is changing. It features new sources of growth, dynamism and innovation \u2014 not only in the celebrated emerging economies, but also in many other countries. In both industrialized and developing nations, ordinary people are making their voices heard and their actions felt by mobilizing, organizing and fighting against domination by a privileged few. They are fighting for a more equal and just world. Calls for the respect of international law and norms and for the overhaul and revitalization of the United Nations and global financial institutions \u2014 with a view of making them more representative and democratic \u2014 are widespread, insistent and often backed by concrete initiatives and concerted actions.\nIn our region, the Horn of Africa, the past two decades have generally been a period of missed opportunities, zero-sum games and repeated conflicts and setbacks. Even today, the situation remains fraught with risk and danger. Yet, recent developments indicate the possibility of a new beginning and a relaunching of the 1990s vision of a peaceful, progressive, economically dynamic and cooperative Horn of Africa.\nEritrea has often spoken of the hostilities and injustices that it has suffered, the difficulties it has faced and the valiant struggles of its people. That is an experience that it shares with many other peoples and nations. That experience informs our country\u2019s views and policies. Yet, Eritrea does not dwell on the past. Rather, it prefers to look to the future. It is keen on building on its encouraging achievements, so as to transform its economy and society and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by relying mainly on the energy, skills and initiative of its people and the judicious use of its natural resources.\nIt is also determined to work actively, constructively and in collaboration with its neighbours for peace, stability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea regions. It seeks to foster relations of solidarity and mutual support with all nations, peoples and organizations that fight for a world free from the scourges of war and poverty and for the respect of human dignity. To conclude, Eritrea is resolved to engage with all nations in modesty and self-confidence.\n"

        "file_text": "On 26 July in Abu Dhabi, the Swiss solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse, finished its world tour. On the same day that the whole world commended that technical feat, the International Organization for Migration issued a statement saying that, since the beginning of 2016, more than 3,000 migrants had lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea. That shows us that once again humankind is capable of the best and the worst: excellence in innovation at the service of the environment, but also powerlessness and a certain inertia in the face of immense tragedy, born of dictatorship, poverty and warfare.\nThe challenges facing the international community are extensive. The situation in the Middle East and in certain regions of Africa, as well as at the gates of Europe, represent a tragic example of that. The weakening of States, economies and societies fosters the radicalization that can lead to terrorism and armed conflict, which bring with them their corollary victims \u2014 refugees and displaced persons. The consequences affect us all. Additional threats remain, such as natural disasters, climate change and its impacts and, indeed, antimicrobial resistance. Economic crises and the vicious cycle of unemployment, vulnerability and social exclusion that accompanies them are of concern to decision-makers around the world.\nIn the face of the scale of those challenges, a strong United Nations is more necessary than ever. The Organization has already proved what it is capable of. Its tireless efforts to mobilize the international community within the framework of various action plans have prolonged the all-important liberalization of the global economy. Over the past 20 years, the United Nations has helped to reduce extreme poverty rates by half and increase average life expectancy. Thanks to United Nations incentives, education for the world\u2019s populations has improved. The involvement of the private sector and civil society in global governance is constantly growing.\nThere is another signal of hope, namely, the recent peace agreement in Colombia. Switzerland, the depositary of the agreement, commends all the parties involved for that breakthrough on the road to lasting peace. Our generation is the first since the beginning of the twentieth century not to have lived through a world war. The United Nations has greatly contributed to that outcome, even if we must admit that there are still too many regional conflicts and that those conflicts have resulted in too many victims.\nBecause of its universality, the United Nations has a unique legitimacy, which gives rise to a monumental responsibility, with the number of its initiatives, agreements and processes constantly multiplying. A new global vision is taking shape, and all States are involved. Among the cornerstones of that vision is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is the common framework for the development of sustainable solutions. It provides the basis for a renewed social contract between leaders and populations.\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which seeks to limit global warming, is a strong sign of the commitment of States. The recent decision of the United States and China to ratify the Agreement is a very important step towards ensuring its success. The first World Humanitarian Summit, held in Istanbul, which helped to develop solutions aimed at helping people affected by crises and disasters, is further evidence of international solidarity. Furthermore, the review of the United Nations peace and security architecture, which we recently completed, highlighted the importance of conflict prevention.\nFinally, this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Human Rights Council, which has substantially contributed to the promotion and defence of human rights. A further step is now needed to strengthen the influence of its actions on the ground. The \u201cAppeal of 13 June\u201d, launched by Switzerland and supported today by 70 States, rightly proposes to improve conflict- prevention activities by more systematically integrating the human rights dimension, including strengthening the links between the Human Rights Council and the Security Council.\nIn recent years, we have provided ourselves with valuable tools to build a better world; now it is time to use them. In that context, I would like to express our gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who, during a decade of hard work, has enabled the United Nations to make significant advances. We are convinced that his successor will continue the work and reform of the United Nations.\nOur approach in this crucial phase must be based on principles that are dear to us, the Swiss, namely, the principles of inclusion and participation. I am convinced that by acting together we will succeed in meeting all the Goals of the 2030 Agenda. Switzerland was one of the first countries to introduce national measures aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda. We are determined to follow through on that commitment.\nI hold the deep conviction that, in order to achieve the goals that we have set, we must have a sound economy. Promoting sustainable economic growth means making commitments that favour societies that offer equitable opportunities for all their members. A thriving economy is a primary objective, because it is a essential tool for creating opportunities for all citizens. A thriving economy makes it easier for young people, women and older workers to enter the labour market. I see that as absolutely consistent with the commitments undertaken by the United Nations. For a dynamic economy that provides jobs and opportunities is an important factor in preventing terrorist abuses and armed conflict.\nIn Switzerland, we have identified three key elements that enable us to regularly be at the forefront of innovation and competitiveness.\nFirst, we have an effective training system that reflects the needs of the real economy as well as those of basic research. University courses and vocational programmes in Switzerland benefit from the same attention and the same care. Enterprise learning enriched by theoretical training in vocational schools plays a central role in the system.\nSecondly, our liberal labour laws allow companies to evolve with the markets, participate in and contribute to technological progress and easily adopt innovative methods and products. The flexibility of our economy becomes the best guarantee of employment.\nThirdly, we have in place an effective and respected social partnership that ensures industrial peace. Regular negotiations between representatives of employers and employees ensure that labour agreements are flexible and accepted by all, and meet the needs of industries and regions.\nBut those key elements cannot produce positive effects without international trade. Exchanges stimulate competition, scientific and technological progress and innovation. And we should never forget that freedom expressed through democracy and framed by the rule of law is the best guarantee in ensuring that a company may realize its full economic, scientific and cultural potential.\nIt is also important to meet the challenges of globalization in the digital domain, not only in terms of transparency, data security and equal opportunities, but also from the perspective of the opportunities of technological, social, political and economic progress. In an open and democratic society, it is certainly vital that people be able to use digital technologies in informed and safe ways. However, we must also do everything possible to ensure that the new possibilities offered by digitization facilitate access to employment rather than make employment more precarious.\nIt is easy to forecast that digitization will make jobs disappear. But that is not what matters; the real challenge is to identify the new jobs that it will create. For it is only by making that effort that we can put in place the training that will allow the greatest number of people to find jobs in tomorrow\u2019s world. In order succeed in that effort, we need to engage in dialogue with the most innovative companies. The United Nations and its specialized agencies can help ensure that all countries can take advantage of the opportunities offered by technological progress.\nSpeaking of the challenges facing the United Nations and the international community leads us naturally to Geneva as an international city. Switzerland is committed to prioritizing that city as a centre of global governance. We are supporting the modernization of the city\u2019s real estate, but we are also strengthening synergies between the various stakeholders in international Geneva, whether in the field of global health or of humanitarian action. There have been a number of initiatives in Geneva in recent months, namely, the Appeal of 13 June to Put Human Rights at the Heart of Conflict Prevention, the launch of a High-level Panel on Water and Peace, the organization of a conference on the prevention of violent extremism, and also various kinds of peace talks and negotiations. They are all evidence of the importance of Geneva as an international city and of Switzerland\u2019s commitment. It is a place that is useful for the world, and we will continue to commit to ensuring that its role is strengthened.\nI am wholeheartedly convinced that the only viable responses to the contemporary challenges that we face are to be found in collective and solidarity-based solutions. To find such solutions, the international community needs a strong United Nations that is also modern and effective. That is the path we must take. Together, we must now support the Organization with vision and determination.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by expressing our gratitude to the President and to the Secretary-General for their notable efforts in carrying out their mandates.\nThe statistics could not be more eloquent \u2014 80 per cent of the world\u2019s population owns only 6 per cent of the wealth, while the wealthiest 1 per cent enjoys half of the world\u2019s patrimony. No less than 795 million people suffer from chronic hunger, and 18,000 children die every day due to poverty. More than 660 million people consume non-potable water, and 780 million adults and 103 million young people are illiterate. It is quite likely that they have never heard of the Millenium Development Goals, but if they had they would scarcely believe in the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe gap between our deliberations and the realities of our peoples is persistent. The lack of political will of industrialized countries is clear. We see the perpetuation of the irrational patterns of capitalist production and consumption that lead to the degradation of living conditions on our planet. The enormous conventional and nuclear stockpiles and the annual military expenditures of $1.7 trillion contradict those who claim that we lack the resources to end poverty and underdevelopment.\nHowever, there are many arguments that justify the urgency of building a new international financial architecture. In developed countries, welfare societies are disappearing, political systems are in crisis, pockets of poverty are expanding, brutal neoliberal adjustment programmes are used against workers, young people and migrants, and dark and dangerous neo-fascist forces gain strength.\nThe philosophy of plundering underpins NATO countries\u2019 military interventions and non-conventional wars against sovereign States as they seek to overthrow Governments and appropriate natural resources. The imposition of unilateral coercive measures and the use of financial, legal, cultural and media tools to destabilize Governments has become our daily bread. The militarization and aggressive use of cyberspace, the violation of the human rights of hundreds of millions of people, and the waves of refugees driven by underdevelopment and NATO interventions towards Europe are evidence of the cruelty, oppressive nature, inefficiency and unsustainability of the current international order, without there being a single response based on respect for human rights and the dignity of persons or aiming at resolving the root causes of the problems.\nThe year 2015 was also one of the worst in terms of climate change, with mounting global temperatures, the melting of the polar ice caps, the rise in sea levels and an increase in greenhouse-gas emissions. Under these circumstances, we reiterate our solidarity with the small island developing States, especially in the Caribbean, which are the most deeply affected by climate change and for which we demand fair, special and differential treatment.\nWhile we all expect to see some progress in the fulfilment by industrialized countries of the obligations entered into under the ambiguous Paris Agreement on Climate Change, only tangible data on financing and transfers of technology to developing countries can justify hopes for the survival of the human species. However, capitalism will never be historically or environmentally sustainable.\nPeace and development are the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations. The creation of a culture of peace and justice as the basis of a new international order is an urgent and imperative need for the human species. Any attempt to prolong the existence of a unipolar world through war, domination or hegemony would be suicidal. The observance of the Charter of the United Nations and international law are indispensable for peaceful coexistence among States.\nThe United Nations must be defended from unilateralism. At the same time, it needs to be reformed into a more democratic Organization, one that is closer to the problems, needs and aspirations of people. It must be capable of leading the international system towards peace, sustainable development and respect for all human rights for everyone.\nThe reform of the Security Council, in both its composition and its working methods, is a task that should not be postponed any longer. The strengthening of the General Assembly and the restoration of the functions that were usurped by the Security Council should guide our search for a more democratic and efficient Organization.\nIt is imperative to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict, inexorably based on the exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to build its own State within the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe situation of the Western Sahara requires an effort pursuant to the relevant United Nations resolutions to guarantee the self-determination of the Sahrawi people and respect for their legitimate right to live in peace in their territory.\nOnce again, we reiterate our confidence that the people of the Syrian Arab Republic will be able to resolve their differences on their own when the foreign intervention aimed at promoting regime change ceases.\nNATO\u2019s attempts to expand its presence closer to Russia\u2019s borders and the deployment of its anti-missile systems are an incentive to the arms race and a threat to international peace and security. Similarly, we express our opposition to the unjust and unilateral sanctions imposed against the Russian people that are also harmful to Europe.\nCuba, which has been the victim of State terrorism, reiterates its strong condemnation of all forms and manifestations of terrorism.\nThe Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, signed in Havana by the Heads of State and Government of our region in January 2014, during the third Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, establishes principles and rules for coexistence, cooperation and respect among States that are indispensable for the realization of the right to peace and applicable to relations within our America and its relations with the hemisphere and the world.\nWe welcome the historic General Agreement for the Termination of the Conflict and the Construction of a Stable and Lasting Peace, which was reached in Havana on 24 August. We will do our best, always at the request of the parties, to support its implementation.\nWe will continue to support the Government and the people of Venezuela, the civic-military union and Constitutional President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros in defence of its sovereignty and self-determination against the imperialist and oligarchic interference that is attempting to destroy the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution to take over Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves and reverse the enormous social achievements that have been attained.\nWe strongly condemn the parliamentary and judicial coup d\u2019\u00e9tat perpetrated in Brazil against President Dilma Rousseff and express our solidarity with her, the Brazilian people, the Workers\u2019 Party and former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nWe reiterate our conviction that the Puerto Rican people deserve to be free and independent, after more than a century under colonial rule.\nWe will not renounce any of our revolutionary and anti-imperialist principles, the defence of independence, social justice and peoples\u2019 rights, nor our commitment to cooperate with those in greatest need. Cuban cooperation workers, who work on all continents, will continue to make their contribution, including the 46,000 persons who are currently working in 61 countries fighting for the life and health of human beings.\nThe Cuban Medical Professional Parole Programme, applied by the United States of America to pursue the political objective of impeding Cuba\u2019s medical cooperation and deprive the recipient countries and Cuba of valuable and highly qualified human resources, is a shameful obstacle. Just over a year has elapsed since the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and the reopening of their respective Embassies. Some progress has been achieved in our bilateral relations, particularly in diplomatic relations, dialogue and cooperation in areas of common interest, as evidenced by high-level visits, including a visit by President Obama, and the dozen of agreements signed on subjects that could render benefits to both countries and the entire hemisphere. However, the fact is that the blockade remains in force. It continues to cause serious damage and hardship for the Cuban people and hampers the functioning of our economy and our relations with other countries.\nExecutive measures adopted by the Government of the United States, although positive, are still insufficient. There are many recent examples of the economic, commercial and financial damage caused by the blockade to Cuba and to third countries. As long as this continues to happen, we will continue to present the draft resolution entitled \u201cNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba\u201d for consideration by the Assembly.\nWe reiterate the readiness of the Government of Cuba to continue developing a respectful dialogue with the Government of the United States, while knowing that we still have a long way to go if we are to normalize our relations, which means building a model of bilateral relations that is a totally new in terms of our common history that can never be forgotten. For this to be possible some day, it will be essential for the blockade to be lifted. In addition, the territory illegally occupied by the United States Naval Base at Guant\u00e1namo, against the will of Cuba, must be returned to us.\nThe Cuban people, even amid the adverse conditions imposed by the current international scenario and the persistence of the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States, continues to be involved in updating the economic and social model that it has decided to implement in a fully sovereign way in order to build an independent, sovereign, socialist, prosperous and sustainable nation.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me begin by congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election to guide this organ. I wish him every success for the well-being of humankind.\nOur country is asking for major reforms and transformations. We understand that it is up to our generation to shoulder the responsibility of continuing to press for the changes that need to take place in order to bring about a better world. In 2009, we emerged from a deep political crisis that had serious economic and social consequences, especially for the most vulnerable of my people. The economy was in the red. We could not pay civil servants. Economic growth decreased, poverty increased. By neglecting security and safety, homicides grew unchecked. Institutions were allowed to become contaminated by drug trafficking and organized crime. We suffered. Above and beyond the crisis of public confidence in the country\u2019s institutions, there was also the fact that Honduras was perceived as a very unsafe country by the rest of the world. And so we ended up being isolated.\nWith much effort, we have been able to restore our democracy, and today all political points of view in Honduras are represented by political parties. Less than three years ago, upon a decision taken by the Honduran people, we began to tread the right path. It has not been easy. On 27 January 2014, we began restoring our country, with support from various sectors of society that believed in our future. They were betting on the right path \u2014 on the construction of a new Honduras. Thirty-two months later, what have we achieved since we began that task?\nIn the economic field, we have seen a reduction in the fiscal deficit to less than 5 per cent of the gross domestic product, with sustained economic growth, whereas the larger economies in our continent were stagnating. There has been improvement in foreign investment and in productive infrastructure. We have seen an increase in tax revenues. We have also seen an improvement in our credit and risk rating. We also have a national economic development programme called Honduras 2020. It seeks to double private investment and the number of jobs created over the next 5 years in strategic sectors of our national economy.\nIn the area of public safety, we have achieved the dismantling of the main drug cartels, which were responsible for the most tragic violence in the history of our country. We have begun to break up the activities of criminal bandits, and we have captured 274 ringleaders of gangs and bandit groups. We began a very positive, aggressive process of cleaning up the police. We worked on strengthening the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the intelligence capacity of the State. We have started to fight corruption and impunity, which had been one of our primary concerns, and have had notable successes.\nIn April 2015, in order to deepen that campaign, we implemented, with the support of the Organization of American States, a mission to aid us in our fight against corruption and impunity in Honduras. This has led to a frontal attack on criminals that has resulted in a decline in violence, reflected in a 26 per cent reduction in the homicide rate. Most importantly, we have saved lives \u2014 lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. In the fight against organized crime, we have enjoyed close international cooperation, based on trust. We have brought before the courts corrupt public servants, business owners and people active in the security and justice fields who have committed crimes and violations of human rights. We have extradited, for judgment outside the country, 12 Hondurans and 5 foreigners accused of drug trafficking or organized crime. Today, we are no longer the first, second, third, fourth or fifth most violent country in the world, according to the Global Peace Index 2016.\nIn the social area, we have reached out with financial assistance to 275,000 families living in extreme poverty in order to improve the indicators for the health and education of their minor children. Some 1.2 million persons receive benefits to improve their living conditions with cement floors, decent roofs, toilets, eco-friendly stoves and water filters. We have reduced illiteracy by expanding preschool and have increased the coverage of intermediate and secondary education. Approximately 1.2 million children receive school lunches, and 1.3 million people have access to decentralized health-care services. We have tripled the purchasing of medications, attaining an average of 80 per cent of the requirements in our public hospitals. We have launched a campaign against non-communicable chronic diseases, with a focus on those occurring in early infancy, as well as programmes for the prevention of adolescent pregnancies.\nBut we recognize that much more remains to be done. We must not lose sight of the future. We cannot lose our way nor abandon the good path that we have set out on. Our country, Honduras, is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThree other issues deserve special attention in this debate at the United Nations: climate change, migratory flows and the rights of victims.\nWith reference to climate change, Honduras has suffered three consecutive years of a drought that has affected food production and endangered food security for nearly 250,000 families. Drought and high temperatures have also led to the proliferation of a very destructive insect, the southern pine-bark beetle, which strips the bark off pine trees and has devastated one sixth of our forests.\nTo deal with those challenges, we have responded with a food-assistance programme directed towards the families at risk, and for three years we have experienced no famine. In those efforts, we have received the assistance of the United Nations and friendly Governments, which have contributed financial resources to complement our national resources. We have also taken action against the pine-bark beetle. We are investing our own resources and enjoy the technical assistance of friendly countries. In addition, we have begun a programme to construct water reservoirs and irrigation systems for small farms in dry areas, complemented by technical assistance and inputs for our farmers. We are developing a comprehensive policy on the land, forests and water so that we can successfully confront the enormous challenges that countries like ours face in climate change.\nThis morning, we submitted to the Secretary- General our ratification instrument for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We Hondurans have complied. I wish to recall a statement I made at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris, to the effect that the accounts were not clear, and I must reiterate once more that the accounts remain unclear. That is why I would invite the countries that have not as yet submitted their ratification to do so. I advise the United Nations and other international organizations to take prompt action to make the Agreement effective so that we will see pragmatic results from the green funds. I firmly believe that solutions need to come at the same pace as the problems. The accounts will not be clear until we achieve concrete results.\nOn the issue of migration, the growing economy, the creation of economic opportunity, security and the response to climate change are all creating better living conditions for our people in Honduras, and with all that we are attacking some of the major causes of irregular migration. The problems that confront our countries are becoming less national and more transnational in character. Political borders have become less significant, and the success of one country increasingly depends on that of other countries.\nOrganized crime is a transnational monster. It knows no nationality and no scruples. It wears many faces \u2014 the movement of capital, the movement of criminals and trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs, among others. The challenges that currently confront countries like Honduras are produced by decisions and actions taken both in the public sector and in the private sector. They are of transnational origin and have transnational consequences. Clearly, they must be resolved in a transnational way.\nThe refugee crisis and migratory flows are not problems just for a single country. Drug trafficking is not a cause or effect produced by a single State. The same holds true for climate change, which is a problem for all of humankind. Owing to our geographic position, Honduras has recently seen an alarming flow of migrants from our continent, as well as from other continents. In just a single year, the volume of migratory flows through our territory has increased 300 per cent. In that light, today I must affirm that migration is a global issue of global interest requiring a global solution.\nOur Governments are finding transnational solutions to our regional problems, for example by driving forward the development initiatives that Honduras, together with El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, has launched with regard to the Gulf of Fonseca, on the Pacific coast. We have also formalized the first customs union on the continent with the Government of Guatemala. That new economic space represents half of the Central American population and approximately half of the gross domestic product of our region. If we incorporate the other countries of Central America into the customs integration initiative, we shall together become the seventh largest Latin American economy. Furthermore, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, together with the United States, have created an alliance for prosperity. We have invited the United Nations, as well as other countries from Latin America, Europe and Asia, to join in that initiative. Together, we have also developed international instruments to protect and promote human rights.\nHowever, in the face of aggression by common criminals and terrorists, we have failed to protect the image of the victims of those attacks. Quite the contrary, the use of force and the resort to terror and violence have been exalted and promoted. That has contaminated respect for the dignity of human persons, thanks to the way in which their images and stories have been presented by the media. The criminals themselves use the media to highlight their violent acts, promoting and continuing to perpetrate them. As in other countries that have experienced criminal violence, in addition to the pain of the loss of human lives and of losing our peace, we have experienced a sense of injustice when the rights of victims and the rights of their relatives and friends are not respected.\nI ask myself, the Assembly and all of humankind: Do the victims of violence have no rights? Is the cruelty with which these human beings have been treated not apparent? Where is the sympathy for their family and friends? Do they not deserve to be respected? With whom lies the responsibility to inform them of such bloody events? What about the responsibilities of those who do not condemn the violence? Why is the inheritance of the material goods of the deceased respected, but the protection of their image and dignity is not?\nRecently in our country, Hondurans witnessed a child taking the hand of his father\u2019s corpse. His father had lost his life on a public road as the consequence of a criminal act. That image was broadcast throughout all media and social networks. It made me reflect and wonder about the extent of the rights of that child. How far do the rights of the family of that child extend? I invite everyone to reflect on that issue, which affects not only the victims but also those closest to them. Such problems have had a significant impact on entire communities and entire generations that have become desensitized to such abominable events and grow up considering fear, intimidation and aggression to be part of everyday life. I believe that victims, too, have rights. Let us reflect upon that.\nToday Honduras calls on Member States to work together to face the challenges and to be part of the solutions. Today, the time has come to act with determination and commitment. I invite the Assembly to solve problems together by assuming the responsibilities that are incumbent on each of us.\n"

        "file_text": "I am truly honoured to address this important forum as President of the Republic of Macedonia and to share with the Assembly the Republic of Macedonia\u2019s positions on the challenges facing us today.\nThe world is at a crossroads marked by numerous crises. We are in a period when fundamental changes are occurring in the world order. We are dealing with transformations that are difficult to stop or control. The centrifugal forces of globalization are calling into question the order that was established after the Second World War. And along with our redefinition of that order, we are redefining its values and principles. In a world in which the powerful do whatever they want and the weak do whatever they must, the rule of law has become the exception rather than the rule. Instead of international security and order, we have a lack of security and a lack of order. We have devalued the true and inalienable human rights and freedoms. Instead of respect for diversity, we are increasingly seeing persecution and the destruction of diversity.\nThere are crises in many regions and at many levels. Conflicts are tending to spread and deepen faster than they can be resolved and rooted out. Their diagnosis is often belated, and the measures taken are reactive rather than preventive, resulting in short-term, painful decisions rather than long-term, less painful solutions. If we were to describe the situation in the world today in one word, it would be \u201cinstability\u201d.\nWe have been openly fighting global terrorism since the very beginning of this millennium. The Republic of Macedonia is part of a coalition that has destroyed many terrorist cells and won many battles in the past 15 years, but we have not yet won the war against terror. In that regard, we are facing a serious challenge. Just like the mythical Hydra, for every terrorist cell that is destroyed, it seems as though two others appear in its place.\nTerrorism in the twenty-first century has developed the ability to absorb defeats, withdraw, regroup and strike back. We are no longer dealing with organizations, but with movements aiming at conquering territories and being driven by ideas going far beyond ethnic, linguistic and cultural differences. In order to win the fight against terrorism, the use of military troops alone is not enough. It is necessary to fight using ideas and programmes to counter radicalization.\nThe Middle East, North Africa and many other regions are crumbling into bloody conflicts in which every day we see the mosaic of communities with different religions, languages and cultures, so painstakingly composed and cherished for centuries, being destroyed. Those conflicts have given rise to threats, risks, humanitarian crises and a new major movement of peoples.\nOn the other hand, a new reality is looming on the European horizon. Under the pressure of the financial and debt crisis, the social and political seams holding the European Union (EU) together are slowly beginning to rip. By erasing internal borders without securing its corridors in the process, the European Union is now unable to protect its external borders. Apart from other things, Europe is currently facing two key challenges \u2014 the migration crisis and the threat of terrorism.\nThe first migration wave eroded European institutions, mechanisms and policies. By preventing illegal migration, the Republic of Macedonia has succeeded in contributing to a large extent to overall security in Europe. Europe is already facing a second, more massive wave. More than 20 million migrants and refugees from Asia and Africa are located very close to the external borders of Europe. In the coming years and decades, millions of migrants will try to set foot on the European continent. The Republic of Macedonia has blocked illegal migration from entering deeper into EU territory. The European Union must find modalities and mechanisms to protect its borders, secure the corridors and integrate the migrants and refugees who have been admitted, but without assimilating them in the process.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has been an independent country for 25 years now. Since the first day of our independence, we have faced continuous and direct threats coming from territories of the EU and NATO member States, or countries under United Nations administration. A large portion of our internal risks and dangers are the result of crises imposed on us from the outside. With the exception of bilateral assistance \u2014 for which we are more than grateful \u2014 the Republic of Macedonia has been facing crises and reducing risks on its own. We are taking measures and making decisions to protect our territory, and thereby also European territory. And for doing that, we have suffered criticism and threats in the form of the blocking of our integration processes.\nThe indecisiveness of the EU in handling the migration crisis has jeopardized the security of the Republic of Macedonia. We were the first country in Europe to declare a state of crisis and to deploy army troops along the borders. As Supreme Commander, I am proud to say that with our crisis management system and a timely reaction, we have succeeded in protecting the national security of the Republic of Macedonia.\nI am aware, however, that many in Europe are thankful for what the Republic of Macedonia has been doing for them. Some are braver and recognize that fact, some are less brave, but I believe that they still respect what we have been doing. The attitudes towards migrants, so far, have even created ghettos without walls in some European countries, in which those who are different are tolerated without ever being truly respected or accepted. Such attitudes have led to isolationism and alienation and have generated breeding grounds for radicalism, violent extremism and terrorism.\nThis year, the United Nations will elect a new Secretary-General. The Republic of Macedonia has nominated a former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for that high-profile position. We appreciate the efforts to make the process a transparent one that considers only the merits of each candidate. The selection process has already begun within the Security Council. On this occasion, I would like to wish the best of luck to Mr. Kerim and reiterate the desirability of electing the new Secretary-General from the ranks of the Group of Eastern European States. At the same time, I wish to thank the current Secretary-General, my friend Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his unrelenting efforts to tackle the various challenges we face, but also to reform the Organization.\nHowever, as we discuss the reform of one of the most important elements of the United Nations system, we seem to forget that even the very goals of the Organization have been brought into question. We talk about human rights while neglecting one of the fundamental rights \u2014 the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. The persecution of people of different faiths and beliefs is becoming more and more visible, not only in non-secular, but also in developed secular societies. Under the current circumstances, some even ask whether, today, the United Nations would ever be able to adopt the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.\nThe Organization represents all countries with all of their differences. However, when making compromises, we should be careful not to compromise the fundamental values, freedoms and vision of the Organization. That vision is written in both the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Even Seneca, when explaining the essence of a city \u2014 in other words, a State \u2014 said:\n\u201cThe strength and security of cities are based on two things \u2014 the material from which houses are built and the laws that regulate relations.\u201d\nA city is destroyed every time one of these two things is lacking. Owing to double standards and the lack of respect for international law, our international order is slowly devolving into global chaos and disorder.\nIn our quarter of a century of independence, the Republic of Macedonia has been well and truly able to feel that cruel reality. On our path towards international recognition and integration, we have faced many blockages and suffered much injury. We have even had to deal with the denial of our right, as Macedonian citizens, to self-identification, without which there is no human integrity or dignity. Owing to that problem, even today, we are still blocked in our efforts to join international organizations, such as NATO and the European Union. For five years now, the Republic of Macedonia has been waiting for the international community to observe and respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice.\nDuring the past few days, members of the Assembly have heard many statesmen speaking about the need to respect international law, and there will be just as many that will immediately forget what they were urging, once they step away from the podium. The judgment handed down by the International Court of Justice regarding the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece was delivered five years ago, as I reminded members of the Assembly two years ago, but that judgment has not been respected to this day. And that is one of the classic examples of the lack of effectiveness of our world Organization.\nThe indecisiveness of the European Union and NATO in failing to unblock the integration of the Republic of Macedonia was one of the main reasons for the perpetual internal political crisis in Macedonia, which reached a climax this year. However, the Republic of Macedonia is not an exception. The entire Balkan region is in stagnation. We see retrograde processes reappearing. The Balkan States believed, quite naively, that someone from the outside would solve all of their problems, and the EU obviously does not have such power.\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nEven in such complex circumstances, the Republic of Macedonia is doing its utmost to maintain the best possible relations with its neighbours. With Greece, we have a difference that is subject to a process led by the United Nations. The two of us, as neighbouring countries, have one open issue, but thousands of areas of common interest and serious challenges, such as the migration crisis or security, which point to the need for close cooperation. The name dispute must not be allowed to impede maximum cooperation in all areas of common interest. But precious time has been lost.\nI therefore welcome confidence-building measures between the two countries, and I call for their expansion and the introduction of new content. The sooner we deliver on those measures, the sooner we will be able to create a positive ambiance, so that we can find a solution to the issue of our name dispute within the framework of the Interim Accord, United Nations resolutions and the judgment of the International Court of Justice.\nI am a Macedonian, my fellow citizens are Macedonians, and I am speaking in the Macedonian language from this rostrum, which is why we ask everyone to respect us as Macedonians, just as we respect everyone else\u2019s right to identify themselves as they feel. We respect the right to self-identification and human dignity of everyone else, and in the same way we ask for that to apply to us as well. As Macedonians, we wish to cooperate and to have the best possible relationship with all of our neighbours. There is no problem that cannot be solved and no difference that cannot be overcome. The only precondition is to respect one another and to reach solutions through dialogue.\nNext year, the Republic of Macedonia will host the Brdo-Brijuni Process, an initiative that is slowly replacing declarative regional initiatives and mechanisms. My wish is to have the Prime Minister of Greece be a special guest at the summit.\nI spoke about some fundamental changes in the world that are divisive, dangerous and disorienting. However, the problem does not lie in those conditions. They are only the consequences of an accumulation of wrong positions, decisions and steps. That is why humankind has lost its way in a labyrinth of crises. That is also why we should not be caught off guard by the crisis with respect to trust in political elites and in the global order itself.\nAs humankind, we have succeeded in achieving amazing scientific and technological developments that have paved the way for progress, simultaneously consuming all our free time and along with that the possibility of deeper thinking and contemplation. We thought ourselves to be the masters of nature, but we could not even overcome our own greed. This is a time of consumerism, moral relativism and extreme individualism. We have disturbed the fragile climate balance, the balance between humankind and nature, thus jeopardizing the future of our descendants. The Sustainable Development Goals, which the Republic of Macedonia fully supports, must correct that error. As a signatory to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Republic of Macedonia has already established its national priorities and contributions with regard to climate change. The problem goes much deeper, though. It is high time that we try to find our way out of the labyrinth of crises.\nAs President, but also as a university professor, I always listen to the voices of young people. I know very well the challenges that they are facing. The potential of youth is still restricted by a multitude of not only political but also mental, economic and educational barriers. Young people around the world still do not have equal opportunities for high-quality education and employment, and they also suffer from the cruel rules of the international market.\nFor a long time, we have been the ones to decide on the future of youth, without allowing them to be part of the decision-making process. We took their needs, requests and wishes for granted, all the while expecting them to follow the rules of the game that we had created for them, without prior consultation. This is perhaps the reason why many global, regional and local policies were not supported by young people and remained on paper only. It is time for this to change. We need policies that are not only about youth, but ones that involve their participation. We need policies for youth, by youth.\nLet me give an example. This year, in the framework of the School of Young Leaders, held under my patronage for seven years in a row, young people from the Republic of Macedonia and from the wider region were all part of an \u201cidea laboratory\u201d in which they were able to develop projects on sustainable development; the promotion and development of public administration; infrastructure, educational and health-care issues; boosting employment; and reducing poverty. Such projects should be supported and promoted, and in that respect I have already initiated contact with the relevant entities in the World Bank. These are projects involving innovative ideas and creative solutions for youth, who are not slaves to the old worldview, which is slowly disappearing.\nWe are aware that the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda is not a ready-made recipe for achieving greater well-being, a better life for our citizens, a more democratic society or a healthier environment for future generations, but it does contain solid guidelines on how to realize these goals. However, even here we are facing a paradox. We now have an international system that\nis trying to bring about sustainable development while encountering difficulty in maintaining itself.\nYoung people are a generation of new technologies, a generation experiencing the advantages of global interconnection. Young people are already living in a world that provides access to an enormous amount of information. Let us allow them to introduce their idealism and perceptions into regional and global initiatives and organizations. Let us allow them to introduce their new, fresh views into the new realities in which we live, unburdened by the prejudices from the past. The past should be a place of reference, not a place of residence.\nThere is a saying that humankind is at its best when it has the highest degree of freedom. However, without laws, there is no freedom, only anarchy. If we wish to leave a safer world to future generations, we must respect international law. But we must also go back to the highest and most enduring moral principles and values, including respect for and acceptance of diversity.\nOften we invent new ideals because we are afraid of the old ones. We look to the future with great enthusiasm because we are afraid to look back to the past. But on the dusty shelves of the past, besides conflicts, prejudice and enmities, we might also find models that enabled peaceful coexistence, respect and acceptance of diversity. One of them is our very own Macedonian model of integration without assimilation.\nPart of the task of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations is to find such models, promote them and make them applicable to today\u2019s modern, dynamic world. We must assist them in this respect so as to learn once again how to live with our deepest ethnic, religious, cultural and ideological differences.\nA philosopher once said that there might have been better times. However, this is our time, and we are responsible for it. We have to think about those who will come after us, the youth. We must not be afraid, because fear is a filter through which we perceive only threats and not the possibilities that are before our very eyes.\nChanging our vision in order to make it correspond to reality is the easiest thing to do. The hardest part is to change reality in order to make it correspond to the noble vision of the United Nations. Part of that vision involves finding a way to promote global governance and order without establishing a world government and predominance of the powerful, and how to lay the foundations for a true multi-ethnic, multireligious and multilingual international society that is free, just, stable and safe.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Our session is taking place amid grim economic and social circumstances that may slow down our collective progress in combating poverty, reducing inequalities and implementing development programmes. Despite these particular circumstances, we must be tireless in our pursuit to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the next 15 years.\nWe must win the fight against abject poverty and suffering to spare humankind the potentially tragic consequences of failed development. That is why I invite developed countries to honour all their commitments to developing countries in the context of the SDGs and development financing. Here, I remind the Assembly of the commitments made in July 2015 in Addis Ababa at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, and also those made regarding Goal 17 of the SDGs, as well as such specific instruments as the Green Climate Fund.\nI welcome the choice of theme for the session, which reminds us of the need to accelerate the pace of change in our societies and to give more opportunities and means to our most vulnerable populations. We must therefore build productive economies if we wish to implement the SDG road map. Our true aspirations for sustainable development must also be mindful of the environment and our determination to combat global warming. We paved the way in Paris, and we must all implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and honour our commitments.\nMy country\u2019s implementation of the Paris Agreement is under way. The Agreement has been deemed to be in accordance with our Constitution, and my Government will deposit its instruments of ratification before the end of the year. Through our National Development Programme 2016-2020 and our C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Perspectives 2040, we intend to mobilize the means required to implement the SDGs. The positive economic situation in our country has already enabled us to improve all social indicators and embark on a comprehensive process to reduce poverty and redistribute the dividends of economic growth. All these achievements will be fully enjoyed by our people in the long term.\nThe ongoing nature of many conflicts remains a true concern for my country. Our Organization, in particular the Security Council and the main stakeholders concerned, must surpass themselves by engaging every means possible to end the suffering of the peoples in Syria, the Middle East, South Sudan and Mali, to mention but those conflicts. Even if the Council reflects our aspirations, the Council cannot effectively resolve the conflicts of our century with its current configuration and working methods. My country calls on all Member States to act and to carry out a comprehensive and just reform of the Security Council that will further bolster its legitimacy in the eyes of the world, and especially of the younger generations.\nThe world must mobilize against terrorism and fight it with the utmost resolve and determination before it inflicts irreparable damage and trauma on our countries and societies. Here, I offer a thought for all the victims of terrorism and express my sympathy to all the families who are in mourning around the world on account of these barbaric acts. As many countries before it, my country witnessed unbearable scenes after the cowardly attack in Grand Bassam, and that reminds us yet again, as if we needed reminding, that no country today is safe from a terrorist attack. No country alone can eradicate this scourge. It falls on the United Nations therefore, to an even greater degree than in the past, to coordinate international efforts to combat terrorism.\nUnless a collective effort is made to bear the cost of security for all, our developing countries will invest in their national security the resources that would otherwise be spent on tomorrow\u2019s priority social programmes. We are familiar with the serious consequences that this would entail, given our young populations. The worsening security environment in many countries has led to a sudden rise in migratory flows of people who are ready to brave all the dangers of a Mediterranean crossing or a journey through the Balkans to reach Europe in particular. Fear and isolation are not an appropriate response when these migrants arrive.\nThe host countries and the international community as a whole must show solidarity and take initiatives in order to tackle the root causes of this phenomenon. Countries of origin must do more to improve living conditions and create a climate of peace and security for their citizens. My Government wishes to welcome the progress achieved at the high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, held here at United Nations Headquarters early this week. But we must do more and do better.\nThe nation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is continuing to develop and modernize its institutions. The economy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire continues to grow at an average annual rate of about 9 per cent. This has enabled us to pursue our efforts to establish the economic and social infrastructures that are needed to improve the well-being of our population. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is peaceful. The successful presidential election in October 2015 put the seal on the return to peace and stability. In the coming months, the Ivorian people will be called on to renew the mandate of parliamentarians and to vote on a new draft constitution, in line with our desire for a modern State.\nGiven the satisfactory progress of recent years, in April the Security Council lifted the sanctions regime that had been imposed on C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in 2004. In June 2017, the United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (UNOCI) will end its mandate and leave C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire once and for all after 12 years of continuous presence. We are particularly proud of these developments. UNOCI goes down in the history of peacekeeping operations as a real success story. I take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to the United Nations and all the countries that provided troops to UNOCI.\nGiven this remarkable progression, my country has decided to put forward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2018-2019. The Economic Community of West African States and the African Union have endorsed our bid. In that regard, I call on all States Members of our Organization to support the candidacy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire during the elections to be held in June 2017. Through this candidacy, we intend to share with other Member States our successful experience of peacekeeping and cooperation within the United Nations.\nI recall that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has in the past contributed to the stabilization efforts in the Congo, Haiti and Central Africa through the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, respectively. It is in this spirit that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as part of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, has worked side by side with our brothers in Mali in a transport company between 2013 and 2015, and we are prepared to send a protection company of approximately 150 individuals by the end of the year.\nI cannot conclude my statement without paying a well-deserved tribute and to express, on behalf of the people and the Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and on my own behalf, our profound gratitude to the Secretary-General, my friend Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his exceptional contribution to peace in the world and in our country. We commend him for his leadership, for the wise way in which he has steered our Organization over the past years and for his constant commitment to peace, security and development in the world. As he ends his term in the service of our Organization, we wish him well in his future endeavours.\n"

        "file_text": "In 2015 in this Hall, the international community shared its concerns on the state of the world: conflicts and civil wars, terrorism and violent extremism, climate change, epidemics and grinding poverty. Unfortunately, the oversupply of problems and the deficit of solutions remains unchanged. The sense of crisis paradoxically drew us together to achieve historic milestones, namely, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nFor the United Nations, 2016 marks the first year of the next seven decades. It is also the first year for implementing the noted landmark achievements. In an increasingly interconnected world that faces a daunting array of complex challenges, the central role played by the United Nations is more crucial than ever. In order to address that multilayered equation in a sustainable way, the United Nations needs to heed calls for inclusive multilateralism, that is, multilateral efforts to include the vulnerable, the isolated and the unempowered.\nThe World Humanitarian Summit, held in May, and the high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of migrants and refugees, held this September, represent part of such joint efforts in that regard. Most of all, we have the flagship blueprint for inclusive multilateralism, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its promise for a world that leaves no one behind.\nThe Republic of Korea is often referred to as a success story for development. As such, we are ready to share our experiences for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Over the past year, my Government launched major initiatives in the areas of education, women\u2019s empowerment, science, technology and rural development. We have introduced Korea Aid, a new development cooperation initiative, a mobile, customized service delivered to those in need. Vulnerable groups are already experiencing better health and medical services, as well as enjoying adequate food and cultural activities.\nThe SDGs and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are inextricably linked to the future of our planet and our people. They should be mutually reinforcing and lead to a virtuous cycle. In that respect, as the host of the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund, my Government is taking domestic steps to complete the ratification of the Paris Agreement as soon as possible this year.\nThe successful implementation of the SDGs relies on the strong anchor of peace and security, as well as respect for human rights. Peace in the fullest sense can be achieved solely when peace and security, development and human rights are advanced together, and that is the essence of the new concept of sustaining peace. It broadens peacebuilding from post-conflict contexts to the whole spectrum of conflicts. We share the renewed awareness of the idea that conflict prevention should be mainstreamed in all United Nations activities.\nAs has been noted by many speakers this week, a frequent signal of looming conflicts is the violation of human rights. In conflict prevention, reading the writing on the wall before it is too late is imperative. We know that from experience, such as in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan. Another symptom is the spread of violent extremism and terrorism. Those are multifaceted challenges, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We need a holistic, inclusive and multi-stakeholder approach.\nThis year, the United Nations embarks on its next 70 years. For us, 2016 is also an important symbolic year: just 25 years ago, the Republic of Korea, together with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, became a State Member of the United Nations. Two Koreas were admitted simultaneously, but we had a dream that in the future, there would be one Korea, just like one reunified Germany in 1991. Looking back at the track record of those two Members, there can be no starker contrast. As President Obama remarked earlier this week here in this Hall, one has taken the path of success, while the other has become a wasteland (see A/71/PV.8).\nThe reason that North Korea has failed is because, among other things, of its fanatical and reckless pursuit of nuclear and missile programmes. North Korea has been the first and only country to conduct nuclear tests in this century. So far it has conducted five such tests, violating multiple Security Council resolutions. Just yesterday, at the eighth ministerial meeting of the Friends of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, 43 countries issued a joint statement condemning Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear tests in the strongest terms. North Korea is the first and only country to develop nuclear- weapon programmes under the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and it has announced its withdrawal from both the International Atomic Energy Agency and the NPT. It is also the first and only country to officially declare itself to be a nuclear-weapon State in its own Constitution.\nNorth Korea\u2019s recent nuclear tests show that its programmes have neared a tipping point. The latest test was the strongest ever. The interval between tests has also been significantly reduced, from three years to eight months. Given the country\u2019s unpredictability and penchant for provocations, the next test and nuclear provocation may come even sooner than we expect. North Korea has also fired 22 ballistic missiles of various types this year alone, amounting to one ballistic missile almost every 10 days. The nuclear and ballistic missile tests show that North Korea is now at the final stage of nuclear weaponization. Even more worryingly, not only has it advanced its nuclear and missile capacity, it has publicly threatened to actually use those weapons preemptively, with the potential to strike my country, the Republic of Korea, in four to five minutes. With such a direct existential threat to our survival, my Government has no choice but to take the defensive measures necessary to protect our nation and citizens.\nIn the wake of North Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test, the Security Council agreed to begin working immediately on appropriate measures based on Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, and it is currently discussing a new draft resolution on North Korea. We believe that the Council should adopt stronger, more comprehensive sanctions that go beyond the scope of resolution 2270 (2016), close its loopholes and further expand and reinforce the existing measures.\nIn that context, we need to find an answer to a more fundamental question, namely, North Korea\u2019s repeated violations of and non-compliance with Security Council resolutions and international norms, which are unprecedented, with no parallel in the history of the United Nations. They show that North Korea makes a complete mockery of the authority of the Security Council, and thereby of the United Nations itself. It is crystal clear that North Korea, as a serial offender, has manifestly failed to uphold its pledge to abide by its obligations under the Charter, particularly the commitments to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. I therefore believe that it is high time to seriously reconsider whether North Korea is qualified to be a peace-loving Member of the United Nations, something that many countries are already questioning. At the East Asia Summit held recently in Laos, my President warned that, unless we put a brake on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions today, we will regret it tomorrow. This is our last chance.\nNorth Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test not only revealed its unambiguous nuclear ambitions, it also exposed its utter disregard for its own people. At a time of the worst flooding that it has experienced in decades, North Korea went ahead with its nuclear test in the very region that was hardest hit by the floods. It is estimated that North Korea has spent at least $200 million on nuclear tests and missiles this year alone, a sum that would have been enough to pay for flood relief. Two years ago, the report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (A/HRC/25/63), which detailed North Korea\u2019s systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations, was an eye-opener for the entire world. Its ripples spread to the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly, the Security Council and even beyond.\nWe live in an age of greater accountability today. North Korea\u2019s human rights abuses should no longer be allowed any impunity. It is also our common responsibility to protect the country\u2019s people when the regime defiantly refuses to do so itself. Now is the time for action. First, the international community\u2019s human rights mechanisms must come up with more robust measures. A group of independent experts on accountability should recommend practical mechanisms to enforce accountability for human rights violations in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, particularly those that amount to crimes against humanity. Secondly, we must focus more on North Korea\u2019s so-called State-sponsored forced labour abroad. There should be greater scrutiny of the human rights of North Korean workers outside the country and of the possible diversion of their wages into North Korea\u2019s programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction. Thirdly, the international community should pay more attention to the desire of North Koreans for freedom and human dignity. They deserve better access to the realities of the outside world. For our part, we recently passed an act on the human rights of North Koreans, reflecting the nationwide consensus that we should no longer ignore the human rights situation in North Korea.\nThis year marks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s tenth year in office and the last session of the General Assembly during his term. I would like to commend his commitment and leadership, and his remarkable achievements in a range of areas, notably on climate change, sustainable development, gender equality, humanitarian assistance and management reform of the United Nations. I believe that he has greatly strengthened the Organization\u2019s role and status through his efforts to deal with the unprecedented challenges that we have seen during a time of enormous transformation.\nThe United Nations is currently in the process of choosing his successor. I am confident that the next Secretary-General will strive to make the Organization stronger and more efficient by building on Mr. Ban\u2019s legacy. The founding principles of the Republic of Korea are at one with the spirit of the Charter\u2019s phrase \u201cWe the peoples\u201d. I hope that this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly, representing the peoples of the world, will help to increase confidence in the Organization as a beacon of hope in a turbulent world. And I would like to assure the Assembly that my country will continue to be a staunch supporter of the United Nations in its important and vital mission.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special honour for me to address the General Assembly on behalf of Singapore, a tiny island city-State that is sometimes referred to as a tiny red dot.\nThe United Nations is essential for our survival and prosperity, as it is in particular for all small States. We are usually on the receiving end of the decisions and actions of large Powers. Fortunately, the General Assembly affirms the principle that all nations, large or small, rich or poor, have an equal stake and an equal right to participate in shaping the discourse on global issues.\nThe year 2016 has been a year of increased uncertainty and volatility. We have seen sluggish growth and poor job creation in the major economies, which have been accompanied by growing xenophobia and disillusionment with mainstream politics. We have witnessed rising nationalism, populism and protectionism, which have clouded the political discourse and confounded electoral outcomes everywhere. The conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya continue unabated, with serious repercussions beyond the region, including causing unprecedented flows of refugees. Terrorism remains a clear and present threat to international peace and security, which has been amplified by social media, and has been used so skilfully by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and other terrorist groups to spread radical ideas and promote violent extremism.\nSouth-East Asia, the region where I come from, has also become a fertile recruiting ground for ISIS.\nIn fact, we know that more than 1,000 men and women, including some Singaporeans, have gone to the Middle East to fight for ISIS. Those people have been indoctrinated with extremist ideology, trained with combat skills and killed people \u2014 and everyone knows that it is always easier to kill the second time around. They will further pose a significant risk as they seek to promote violence at home, overthrow legitimate Governments and establish a caliphate in South-East Asia. Singapore is committed to working with its friends and partners to address the threat of violent extremism and terrorism by exchanging intelligence and sharing our own experience with deradicalization programmes.\nWhile that is taking place, we also recall the Ebola virus epidemic in 2014 and the current zika infections. They are stark reminders that global health remains a concern. We all need to work with the World Health Organization to keep our countries safe, while remaining open, connected and functioning.\nIn an uncertain world, small States like Singapore will have to work that much harder just to stay afloat. Small boats on a rough sea are much more likely to be tossed and overturned than a large tanker with heavy ballast. For our survival and our prosperity, small States have to stay open and connected to the world. But, by definition, our very openness makes us vulnerable to external shocks and threats. Small States like ours do not have the option of retreating inwards or opting out of the global system.\nIt is a reality that the world will become more and more interdependent. In such an environment, no country can succeed on its own, even if a country is not an island State like mine. To achieve global security and prosperity, we need to work with one another to seek win-win outcomes. I realize that, inevitably, there will be competition and rivalry between States, especially among the major Powers. But I want to make this point: relations between States need not be a zero-sum game. All countries benefit when there is peace and stability, and that is essential for building partnerships and economic cooperation everywhere.\nThree elements are crucial for the survival and prosperity of small States: first, a rules-based multilateral world order; secondly, international partnership and cooperation; and, thirdly, sustainable development. Allow me to elaborate.\nOn the first point, a rules-based multilateral system enables all States to deal with each other in a fair, transparent and predictable manner. The United Nations represents an international world order based on rules, norms and principles. We emphatically reject the notion that might is right. That is why small States are often the strongest proponents of the United Nations. For us, the United Nations represents a rules-based international order, and we believe that is a precondition for our very existence as independent, sovereign States.\nThe second essential element is international partnership and cooperation. Some of the most significant challenges of our time are transnational in nature. Examples include global economic growth, climate change, epidemics and terrorism. Therein lies the importance of the United Nations.\nThe recent successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change last November was a good example of how countries around the world could come together to solve a problem posed to the global commons. That the Paris Agreement will likely enter into force less than seven months after it was opened for signature is a confidence-booster for the United Nations system. Singapore is proud to have played its part by actively participating in negotiations and to have been part of the early wave of countries that deposited their instruments of ratification at the high-level event on the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on 21 September this year.\nA collective voice for small States speaks louder, and our collective action has been an effective catalyst for change at the United Nations and globally. I am pleased to note that, under the chairmanships of Grenada, Nauru and now Maldives, the Alliance of Small Island States played a catalytic role during the climate-change negotiations. Similarly, the Forum of Small States brings together 107 member States to exchange ideas and support each other in our common concerns. The Global Governance Group, also known as the 3-G, provides a platform for approximately 30 small and medium-sized countries to exchange views on global governance and contribute to the discussions of the Group of 20 (G-20). The 3-G has helped to channel the views of a broad range of countries to the G-20 presidency, thereby making the G-20 process more inclusive.\nThe third important element for the survival and prosperity of small States is sustainable development. Singapore believes that there are two key prerequisites for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe first prerequisite is the rule of law. I made the point earlier that, at the international level, a rules- based system is essential for all States, especially small States, in order for us to cooperate and to safeguard our rights. But a commitment to the rule of law at the domestic level is equally important. Without good governance, transparency, strong institutions and a clear legal framework, development can neither be sustainable nor benefit ordinary people.\nThe second prerequisite in that context is international partnerships. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be achieved only through collaboration and partnership. Multilateral processes, such as the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), to be held in Ecuador in October, are important avenues to help advance the SDGs, especially SDG 11. The draft new urban agenda to be adopted by the Habitat III Conference will highlight the link between urbanization and sustainable development and provide a framework for cities and Governments around the world to collaborate and find sustainable solutions.\nAnother important issue that requires cooperation involves the sustainable management of our forests, the prevention of land degradation and the loss of biodiversity form. This issue is addressed by SDG 15 in the 2030 Agenda. In South-East Asia, transboundary haze from forest and peatland fires started by human beings have impaired the health of millions of people, compromised the safety of aircraft navigation, damaged our regional economies and accelerated climate change. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) adopted a road map to achieve what we hope will be a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. We need to strengthen partnerships among Governments, the private sector, civil-society organizations and other important stakeholders with a view to addressing the root of the problem. That is a long-term challenge that requires sustained attention and continued collaboration among countries in our region and beyond.\nDeveloping countries need international support and assistance in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Singapore is fully committed to helping other developing countries build capacity and enhance human capital, and I declare this on behalf of a country that has only human resources and human capital to offer.\nSince 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme has provided training to more than 100,000 officials from other developing countries. Last year, in a statement made at the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, we launched from this rostrum (see A/70/PV.10) a new sustainable development programme through which we are working with such United Nations agencies as the United Nations Development Programme, UN-Water and UN-Habitat to support fellow developing countries in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Singapore has also tailored training programmes for small island developing States in areas including sustainable development, climate change and public governance.\nSmall States make up more than half of the States Members of the United Nations. To quote Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s statement at the twentieth anniversary of the Forum of Small States, in 2012,\n\u201cBeing small does not mean the absence of big ideas\u201d.\nThe Secretary-General has been a strong supporter of small States, and we thank him for his leadership and support. I think we should also recognize the important contributions he has made to sustainable development and climate change during his two terms as Secretary-General.\nIn conclusion, let me say that small States, despite our size, have made significant contributions to the international community. We have helped to build consensus and find solutions to key global issues, including climate change. Small States can play an even greater role, provided we work together. Ultimately, small States need the United Nations to create the framework for building partnerships, promoting mutual development and pursuing peace and security within a rules-based multilateral system.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\nSeventy-one years after the founding of the United Nations, we have made significant progress in human development. Inspired by the guarantees in the Charter of the United Nations, people across the world, and in Africa in particular, have achieved freedom and self- determination while expanding democracy. Thanks to the international community\u2019s advances in technology and collective action, the world has made remarkable strides in health care, education and agriculture and has eliminated a number of killer diseases. The Cold War is behind us, paving the way for greater opportunities for global synergy. Even among younger nations such as Kenya, technological innovations such as M-Pesa, our mobile phone-based platform for money transfer and financial services, are leapfrogging us into the future, promising greater prosperity and integration.\nYet despite such remarkable strides, human progress is still constrained by a gamut of challenges \u2014 inequality within and between nations and regions, prosperity that does not translate into prosperity for all, poverty, violations of human rights, instability and growing environmental fragility. Such momentous challenges call for a collective effort on the part of the community of nations.\nToday, Africa\u2019s global trade stands at 3 per cent of the world\u2019s total. It consists primarily of crude oil, which accounts for 50 per cent, while the remainder is divided between unprocessed minerals and agricultural raw materials. Meanwhile, Africa\u2019s population is set to surpass that of India and China combined by 2050. Unless our trade imbalance is reversed, as a matter of urgency, it will accentuate vulnerability, enhance poverty and increase the risk of insecurity and instability for both Africa and the rest of the world. We need to reverse those trends and imbalances.\nThe global community, cognizant of those challenges, has made important commitments by concluding agreements on the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa agreement on the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063. For our part, Kenya has continued to play an active role in leading international efforts. In the course of 2016, we have hosted three important international conferences seeking sustainable solutions to global challenges.\nFirst, we hosted the second United Nations Environment Assembly in May to discuss current challenges to our global environment. Secondly, Kenya hosted the fourteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in July. The Conference focused on pressing issues related to global trade and economic development. Thirdly, just in the past month, in August, alongside Japan, the African Union, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank Group, we co-hosted in Nairobi the sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development. The Conference addressed specific concerns on how to speed up economic growth, investment and development in Africa in order to help eradicate poverty and promote shared prosperity. We forged good outcomes from all three conferences. I have no doubt that if implemented in full, each of the recommendations made would go a long way towards transforming the world we live in.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development during the seventieth session ushered in a new era of international development cooperation and development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect our ambition and hope for a better future for ourselves and for our children. We expect that the implementation of the SDGs will result in transformed societies, improved environmental and climatic conditions and global sustained economic growth. For that to happen, however, we also believe that we must eradicate the poverty in our midst by building a fairer global trading system and a more equitable distribution of wealth within and among countries.\nIt is our belief and expectation that international cooperation will remain at the core of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We therefore note the importance of global partnerships, particularly the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation. The Partnership has a special role to play in accelerating the delivery of development outcomes as effectively, fairly and efficiently as possible, with particular attention to the least developed countries. We therefore look forward to the second high-level meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation that will take place in Nairobi later this year. I extend a warm welcome to all Member States to attend.\nThere are certain priorities that the Government of Kenya attaches great importance to in implementing the Kenya Vision 2030, the United Nations 2030 Agenda, and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063. Among those priorities are issues of youth, women and persons with disabilities. As is the case with Governments in developing countries, the challenge of integrating youth and women in our societies and economies remains a daunting one, but the evidence for us is clear. If we do not succeed at mainstreaming gender and integrating youth into our vision, goals and agendas, we shall fall miserably short of our ambitions. That is why Kenya continues to remain focused on the priorities of youth and women, including building and financing special programmes for their full integration and mainstreaming\nIn a related matter, the remarkable achievements of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are noteworthy. That is why the Government last week pledged $5 million towards the fifth replenishment cycle of the Global Fund. Moreover, we also pledged $500,000 to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.\nWe are acutely aware that the challenges we face in achieving our aspirations are not only political, economic and social, but also environmental and climatic. The conservation of all wildlife and marine life, as well as the conservation and protection of our oceans, lakes and land ecosystems, including forests and trees outside forests, matters considerably to our future. Our food security and economic prosperity \u2014 essentially, our lives \u2014 are tied to those matters, which is why we continue to pay great attention to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the United Nations forest instruments and the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species.\nKenya welcomes the ongoing preparations for the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III). We look forward to the Conference and subsequent adoption and implementation of the new urban agenda for the twenty-first century. Kenya recognizes that the future of cities is fully integrated into the achievement of our own Vision 2030 and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. We also believe that a stronger United Nations Habitat is crucial to helping guide the rapid urbanization we are witnessing across the globe. How the international community continues to support the Organization and how we handle cities throughout the world will be integral to the success of the 2030 Agenda.\nToday, our world is confronted by large-scale instability and fragility, which are causing unprecedented human suffering and forced displacement. Furthermore, new security threats \u2014 including violent extremism, terrorism and radicalization \u2014 threaten to roll back the gains we have made so far. In the Horn of Africa, those factors, together with ecological fragility and natural disasters in the face of scarce resources, have complicated the pursuit of development.\nKenya welcomes the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) and the envisaged comprehensive refugee response framework that will guide the humanitarian response in a more humane, sensitive, timely and compassionate manner. We also take note of and applaud the Secretary- General\u2019s convening of the World Humanitarian Summit in May, which refocused the world\u2019s attention on the plight of refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons. Kenya commits its availability to participate, as always, in discussions that will guide and give a firm way forward to that endeavour.\nFor the past two and a half decades, the region has been seized with a situation in Somalia. Throughout that time, Kenya has stood with Somalia, provided a safe haven for refugees, joined peacekeeping missions and invested heavily in resources to combat Al-Shabaab and its affiliates. That solidarity has helped to substantially weaken Al-Shabaab, liberate large swaths of land in Somalia and provide space for the Somali Government to begin the journey of rehabilitation and reconstruction. It is in that context that the Government of Somalia has strongly expressed its willingness to receive its citizens who are currently refugees \u2014 not just in Kenya, but in other parts of the world. For its part, Kenya has committed to $10 million this year to support the safe, orderly, voluntary and dignified repatriation of more than 400,000 Somali refugees living in Kenya. Sadly, the efforts of the region and of Somalia\u2019s neighbours have not been matched by the commitment of the international community.\nInstead of supporting that regional effort this year, our partners, including the European Union, cut support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) by 20 per cent, while security experts were suggesting a budgetary increase for AMISOM in order to procure ground troops to secure Somalia. Despite repeated appeals, the Security Council has failed to provide adequate, predictable funding or force multipliers for AMISOM. I once again implore members of the Security Council to take the matter seriously and align the mandate of AMISOM to the threat levels in Somalia on land, air and sea.\nWith regard to repatriation, since 2012 the international community has pledged upwards of $500 million to support Somalia in its reconstruction and repatriation efforts. It is unfortunate than under 2 per cent has been received. That failure of solidarity has placed a disproportionate burden on Somalia\u2019s neighbours and risks undermining all efforts concerning refugees, helping Somalia rebuild and managing the ongoing elements of terrorism and extreme radicalization.\nAs Somalia moves into its next phase of political transformation, the Vision 2016 programme remains the best course of action for the country. However, the success of the post-2016 period will largely depend on how the current electoral process is managed. Somalia requires the full support and commitment of the international community in order to complete the process of political transition that will set the stage for a peaceful and prosperous Somalia.\nThe road to peace and security in South Sudan has been long and difficult. Sadly, recent events and developments threaten to plunge the country, and indeed the entire region, into a security and humanitarian crisis. Kenya, as a guarantor of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, has been spearheading the search for sustainable peace and continues to make significant investments in efforts to build peace in South Sudan.\nI call upon the parties to the Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan to honour their commitment and work towards its full implementation. That is the only basis for durable peace and reconciliation in that troubled country. The efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), buttressed by the African Union Peace and Security Council, have been vital to these processes. The history of conflict resolution demonstrates that regional mechanisms are the best avenues towards sustainable outcomes. It is therefore imperative that the international community channel its efforts and support through IGAD.\nLast year, here at the United Nations, Kenya made pledges during the Leaders\u2019 Summit on Peacekeeping. I would like to confirm today that Kenya has indeed lived up to every pledge it made. The first engineering capability troop training for African peacekeepers is ready and has been completed in Nairobi. That was done with the collaboration of our own Kenyan defence forces and the United Nations and with support from the good Governments of Japan and Switzerland.\nKenya reaffirms its commitment to continuing to provide training facilities for United Nations programmes, as part of its pledge to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping operations. Kenya, as the current Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, has been at the forefront of advocating for a new peacebuilding architecture for sustainable peace throughout the world. That is why, later today, Kenya will co-host a pledging conference to boost the Secretary-General\u2019s Peacebuilding Fund. For us, the message is clear \u2014 if we are to ever enjoy a peaceful world for all, we cannot invest any less in peacebuilding than we do in peacekeeping. Today, in the pledging conference, the Government of Kenya will pledge $100,000 to the Peacebuilding Fund.\nWhile we build the peacebuilding architecture, we must also dedicate greater efforts to rebuilding and transforming the United Nations system as a whole. We need to transform our global Organization into a more effective and responsive entity that reflects the complex challenges and realities of the twenty-first century.\nWith regard to the Security Council, Kenya, as a member of the Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on the Reform of the United Nations Security Council, is deeply concerned that progress towards addressing the historical injustice in the representation of the African continent and its people on the Council remains not only slow but unpromising.\nThe seventy-first session must achieve greater progress on that matter. I take this opportunity to request that President Thomson prioritize the appointment of the next chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, who will preside over a year of real progress on that matter. It cannot be that, in a world where democracy is the standard norm and accepted practice, the single largest body in the world, the United Nations, plays by different rules. It cannot be that one or two or five individuals can hold ransom the seven billion people living in the world. It is accepted that democracy is the basic standard for any meaningful engagement in any part of the world, in any country or any self-respecting organization.\nIn the same light, we urge the continued strengthening of the United Nations global footprint in general and of the United Nations Office in Nairobi in particular. That will increase the relevance of the United Nations and enhance its legitimacy in the global South.\nSimilarly, the seventy-first session must remain seized of the two-State solution as the best way out of the Palestinian-Israeli crisis. Kenya supports the vision of two peaceful, prosperous, brotherly States living side by side.\nFinally, after ten highly successful years, the time has come for us to bid farewell to Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General. Mr. Ban has been a great steward of the international community, a humble and dedicated Secretary-General to Member States, a standard bearer of human rights, a champion of development and climate change and a friend of not just Africa, but Kenya. On behalf of the Government and people of Kenya, I wish to extend our sincere gratitude to him for his friendship and his hard work. We wish him and his wife well in their future pursuits.\nAs the international community now finally moves onto the last stage of selecting a new Secretary-General, it is my fervent hope that the Security Council will exercise its responsibility in selecting a new Secretary- General in a manner that will reflect our collective concerns for the development agenda, for world peace and cohesion and for the key challenges that continue to face our collective enterprise of building a better world and a better future for all of us and for our children.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by congratulating the President on his assumption of office. The Maldives is proud to welcome a distinguished diplomat from a fellow island State to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\nI also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all of his hard work over the past 10 years, and especially for his efforts on climate-change advocacy and sustainable development and his partnership with small island developing States (SIDS). He is certainly leaving a legacy of enormous historical significance.\nRarely do we get an opportunity to come together \u2014 the whole world \u2014 for a moment of collective agreement. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was such a moment. It is an Agenda of hope, a blueprint for advancing humankind, a plan for empowering the impoverished and a promise to future generations. The Agenda recognizes at its core that all efforts to achieve development should be holistic and that poverty is multidimensional. It recognizes that differentiated responses are necessary, even if aspirations are universal. It recognizes that development efforts should include everyone and address everyone.\nPresident Abdullah Yameen Abdul Gayoom\u2019s development efforts aim to empower everyone so that all of society can share in the development dividends. We have reached our current situation through sustained, continuous, and targeted investment in health and education.\nWe find that the best way to sustain our developmental gains is to focus on our people. That is why we have made it our aim to deliver easily accessible health care to every citizen \u2014 a feat that is extremely challenging for a population of 338,000 people dispersed over 188 islands. It is why we have ensured free health care, provided sea ambulances on all 20 atolls and established a pharmacy on every inhabited island. It is why we have not stopped investing in education, despite achieving nearly 100 per cent literacy. Rather, we have continued to invest in teacher quality, while continuously improving and updating our curriculums and our approach. It is why we aim to provide affordable social housing, especially to all vulnerable groups of our society. In that connection, we aim to empower people with disabilities through financial and material support, such as the provision of housing for those with disabilities. That is also why we have chosen to focus on youth \u2014 improving their lives, their livelihood opportunities and their aspirations.\nInvesting in our people will put us on the right path. No investment has higher returns than investments in women and girls. Empowering women and girls to make their own choices and to determine the destiny of their choosing is not only the moral, responsible and correct choice to make; it is the smart decision to make. Women constitute half of our population. They can,\n20/34 16-29817 and should, contribute to our economy; they can, and should, contribute to our society.\nWomen in the Maldives have had the right to vote since our first Constitution, in 1932. Women in the Maldives have always been in our offices, in our politics and in our society. They have always had equal pay and equal rights, which is now enshrined in our Constitution. Today a woman in the Maldives can also go to a court of law and use the newly adopted Gender Equality Act to claim those rights. They can challenge cases involving gender inequality, sexual harassment and sexual abuse with specifically defined laws to back them up. We still have a long way to go \u2014 every country does \u2014 but we believe that we are on the right track to making institutional and structural changes that will bring about lasting and sustainable normative change.\nA much-celebrated feature of the 2030 Agenda is its universality. The Goals and targets apply to all nations; they have been adopted by everyone. Yet embedded in those common responsibilities is the reality of special circumstances. Maldives is a small island developing State \u2014 a status that we cannot graduate from. Our islands are uniquely susceptible to economic, environmental and institutional shocks because we are so dependent on the rest of the world. Measures of development that are used to rank countries continue to ignore that reality. Development status continues to be determined on the basis of gross domestic product per capita. That system disadvantages smaller countries with small populations. To escape the \u201cisland paradox,\u201d we need the international community to re-evaluate how development is assessed. There needs to be a concerted effort to integrate the economic vulnerability of countries into such assessments. Without such a re-evaluation, our approach to development will never be holistic.\nThe fact that we have graduated from least-developed- country status does not mean that we have overcome our challenges. Large-scale infrastructure \u2014 ports, airports, hospitals, harbours \u2014 is still required across the entire Maldives. Yet the large-scale financing needed for those projects is not readily available because the preferential and concessional arrangements for financing were lost after we graduated from least- developed-country status. Those limitations make it harder to maintain and sustain the development gains that enabled us to graduate in the first place.\nThe Maldives is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to environmental shocks and one of the most exposed to the impacts of climate change. Climate change is an existential threat to our country. It has the potential to erode decades of development gains. For decades, we have been advocating urgent action on climate change and asking the world to take notice. As a lone voice in a sea of sceptics, we were not necessarily heard. But today, together with the 43 members of the Alliance of Small Island States, we can can have a greater impact. With 13 other SIDS, we, the Maldives, were among the first ratifiers of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We know that our emissions are almost negligible. But we want the international community to know that, small though we may be, we are making the choice to take action, and to take action now. We want the international community to continue to invest in action to prevent climate change and in forging meaningful partnerships. Investing today is saving tomorrow.\nWhile we continue to be alarmed by the realities of climate change, another crisis looms. That is the state of our oceans. As a large-ocean State, our major economic activities depend on the health and wealth of the oceans. We are concerned about them. As in many situations, the issue at hand is one that needs a collective response. One such opportunity is the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, on the sustainable use of the oceans, which is to be held in June 2017. It will provide an opportunity for the international community to come together with renewed hope to find solutions that can get the results we desire.\nAn overarching and cross-cutting theme across all the agendas is investment \u2014 investing in our people, investing in our economies and investing in our environment. Above all, investment in our institutions is of the utmost importance. In order to implement ambitious agendas, our institutions and governance structures need to be sufficient and capable of delivering the results we want. The Maldives has been arguing for some time now that, unless small States are able to build strong institutions, they will not be able to build resilience in the spheres of economy and climate change.\nWe began the process of democratization only a decade ago. Informed by events and based on lessons learned, our institutions are adapting and changing. Institutions need space to form on their own. They need to develop organically and to evolve with the needs and priorities of our society. While a healthy amount of scrutiny is necessary and welcome, institutions cannot build resilience under a constant microscope. However, the Maldives will remain engaged with the international community.\nToday we have accepted that economic advancement goes hand in hand with social development and environmental protection. I hope that we have all accepted the fact that development needs to be holistic and that problems and solutions have interlinked consequences. The massive shift seen in provisions of the 2030 Agenda reflects precisely that reality, that all issues are interlinked.\nIt is in that vein that we have accepted that there can be no sustainable development without peace, and no peace without sustainable development. And nowhere is that more apparent than in Palestine. Cycles of violence and hatred perpetuated by the occupying Power, Israel, have led nowhere. A two-State solution that offers peace, stability and security is the only solution. Guaranteeing Palestinians the right to self- determination and sovereignty over their own land and natural resources is the only way out of the conflict.\nA military solution is never the answer. Look at the condition of Syria. Thousands of innocent children, men and women have lost their lives to the conflict. Hundreds more are fleeing for their lives, only to be turned away by the politics of fear. Fences and wires do not stop violence; compassion and tolerance do. The rising tide of hatred, Islamophobia and xenophobia in the name of security will lead only to more violence, as more people feel more marginalized and more people find more reasons for hatred. And radical elements of society find much to feed on in poverty, misery and victimization.\nWe live in a world marred by extreme acts carried out in the name of religion and extremist beliefs, which instil fear in others. That is our reality. The Maldives condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We reject radicalism. We especially denounce all acts of violence carried out in the name of Islam, for they are not only un-Islamic but anti-Islamic. We have passed legislation to address foreign terrorist fighters. We have established the National Counter-Terrorism Centre. And next month, we will also host an international seminar on counter-terrorism and counter-radicalization.\nThe United Nations is still the best-placed Organization to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The knowledge, practices and power of convening that the United Nations draws on are unmatched. Yet there is a recurring concern that we hear \u2014 a concern that we ourselves have voiced \u2014 namely, the need to increase representation in the main bodies of the United Nations. Small States such as the Maldives are often underrepresented, because our delegations are small and our capabilities are stretched. Every Member of the Organization must have an opportunity to serve and have an equal chance to be part of every body, especially the Security Council, in order to help make decisions that affect us all. We do not believe that might or size should determine destiny. Our ability, our motivation, our will to work and our ideas are more appropriate criteria.\nFor the first time since it joined the Organization, 51 years ago, the Maldives has boldly put forward its candidature to the Security Council for the 2019-2020 term. That is because we believe that the opportunity should be available to all and because we believe that we can serve. We believe that intent, resolve, fairness and the principle of representation must decide such opportunities.\nIn an ever-changing world, that which defines success for countries is the ability to adapt according to changing needs. The resilience of countries, continued investment and continuous will to work are critical. As a small island State, we face myriad challenges and vulnerabilities. But today we ask Members to value us because of our abilities, not our vulnerabilities. Evaluate our progress relatively, not against inapt benchmarks. We may be small, but we surely can be significant.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to cordially congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of the Republic of Fiji on his election as President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. With a representative from a country that is famous for the quality of its rugby leading our work, we can be assured that our work will be masterfully refereed. I wish to join those who have already expressed our collective gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who in his capacity as Secretary-General has spared no effort to preserve peace where it is threatened and to restore it where violence is raging. The limitations that he encountered during his tenure were not his own, but those of a United Nations in need of reform.\nThe general debate provides us with an opportunity to take stock of humankind and our planet. Each and every one of us must make an effort to express the concerns and expectations of our peoples. We are the voices of the world. To say that the world is doing well, however, would not be credible. It must be noted that the outstanding progress made in science and technology has not been used to serve peace or the well-being of humankind.\nThere is a word that summarizes the tragedy of our world: violence. I speak here of wartime violence, terrorist violence, violence towards civilians and, tragically, towards children, violence towards other living species that are disappearing in large numbers, and violence towards the planet, which is suffering from a degree of turmoil that is threatening the survival of humankind itself, such as we know it today.\nHow is it that in the twenty-first century we are still facing these kinds of challenges? It is not enough to simply observe what is already clearly evident. We must understand these problems and respond to them. Our generation and, above all, future generations deserve a better world. Time restraints require that I focus on just a few topics.\nI would first of all like to address collective security. The world is reeling from an outbreak of conflicts ravaging the Near and Middle East, but in other regions of the world as well. It is no less anxious about new tensions in other strategic regions of the planet, as the abuse of the right to intervene has catastrophic consequences that destabilize s States and entire regions. We observe the opening up of new global divisions characterized by policies of containment, which causes States to mobilize military means and results in new alliances that exclude certain other States.\nThe world became unipolar in 1991 and has since moved towards greater multipolarity, which has naturally generated strong resistance and troubling\ntypes of behaviour. Should countries large in size, population or economic power be absent from the Security Council? It is clear that the system of collective security that was implemented in 1945, and which was adapted to the bipolar world left in the wake of the Cold War, is now in great distress.\nA small country such as my own too often feels pressure to choose sides and tries to reach understandings with other countries in order to give a voice to those who are scarcely listened to and who are always the first to suffer from geopolitical decisions. We have travelled that road before and have been subjected to a proxy war. Moreover, we cannot simply articulate the anguish of new escalating dangers. Together with all countries that are willing, we want to work to strike a new global balance that respects the realities of the twenty-first century. When tensions do emerge, we believe that our role is not to become embroiled in them but to enter into dialogue and do everything we can to contribute to the peaceful solution of disputes.\nCurrent events force me to address the issue of terrorism and, more specifically, its root causes. Is such fanaticism not just the violent expression of anger? Such anger must be analysed. There are too many injustices and inequalities in our world. More importantly, there is an overly systematic two-tier system when it comes to decision-making. International law is imposed on some while others are exempted. With regard to religion, each Government must ensure, as we have successfully done in Cambodia, that members of all faiths can peacefully and respectfully live together in tolerance.\nHow can we overlook the tragedy of the Palestinian people, whose rights have been violated for 70 years? This tragedy has fed the revolt in the Arab world and hatred among the most indignant. An entire population\u2019s rights have been denied for decades. When faced with such a fact, how can we not understand that discourse on universal values and international law is no longer credible?\nWe hold no illusions; terrorism will be eradicated only when the principal reasons for becoming a terrorist no longer exist.\nI would like to make a short comment on the economy. We now have sufficient experience in that area to evaluate the globalization born from World Trade Organization agreements and subsequent free trade agreements. Such experience has allowed us to make progress through the liberalization of markets, but it has also shown us that real dangers emerge when corporations are given rights that allow them to conduct their business in any way they see fit. Continuous blackmail in favour of offshoring is a major obstacle to a country like mine, where we are working to improve working conditions and the standard of living, which remains low.\nI wish to share in the collective satisfaction following the agreement last December at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We also welcome the fact that the two principal contributors to global warming have confirmed their involvement and determination. Sometimes deception is employed when it comes to respecting treaties, but it is an undeniable truth that we cannot deceive our planet. If the twenty- first session of the Conference of the Parties does not lead to concrete actions taken by all parties, there will be terrible and unstoppable consequences, leading to a series of destructive phenomena that will create new levels of suffering.\nI now turn to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development embodies a series of very ambitious objectives. Such ambitions need to be matched, however, with a corresponding level of true political will. In that regard, I would like to highlight the responsibility of wealthy countries, which have the necessary resources to make the Goals a reality. Although the world has indeed made great progress in terms of human development since 1990, we should pay particular attention to two facts provided by the United Nations Development Programme: there are more than 2 billion people living in poverty in the world and 1.2 billion people living on less than $1.25 per day. If we take into consideration those two figures alone, the 17 SDGs become even more urgent.\nI would like to conclude by speaking about my country, Cambodia. International institutions, Western parliamentarians and some Western non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have pointed the finger and tried to lay blame. However, I do not come before the Assembly as an accused party. I am addressing those present on behalf of a country that is often judged negatively, and even more often unrecognized and misunderstood, especially by the Western world. I come here with confidence. Many of us here refuse to see the international community conflated with the Western community and its opinions.\n10/34 16-29817 I am a survivor of the atrocities of Pol Pot and of a country that was turned into an immense forced labour camp. After United States Air Force bombers completely destroyed us, our country endured the extreme suffering brought on by one of the cruelest regimes of the twentieth century. I must therefore recall that in the wake of such affliction in Cambodia in 1979, Viet Nam was the only member of the international community to respond to the call of those fleeing the genocidal regime. Our population of 8 million inhabitants in 1970 had been reduced to some 4.5 million by 1979. The State, central and local Governments, hospitals, schools, our currency and religion had all ceased to exist. The roads were damaged and infrastructure and institutions had disappeared. In 1979, all that remained in Cambodia were 8 of our 750 lawyers, 45 of our 450 doctors and 7,000 of our 22,000 teachers. A total of 54 per cent of all medical personnel were gone, and of our 1,600 agricultural technicians, only 200 were still alive.\nIn 1979, the survivors were in extremely debilitated physical and mental states. Nevertheless, they were still punished for having been freed by a country that had done nothing to please the coalition that for over 11 years caused total destruction in the country, traumatized the survivors and imposed a crippling embargo that prohibited all development aid. We had nothing and we were deprived of everything. Given that, Members of the Assembly might wonder why would I want to bring up the past. I do so because it is a past that is not yet in the past. How do we not understand that the past continues to deeply affect the present? How do we not understand that the past continues to weigh upon us today in terms of human resources?\nIn the West, some NGOs, media and Governments describe even our slightest shortcomings as crimes of the State. With the Paris accords, we were obliged to accept a perfect model of democracy that took no account of the specificities of our country or the human resources required to implement it. We are now being criticized for disregarding the rights of the opposition. At the same time, however, the western NGOs and Governments that support the political opposition claim that we are violating our laws and not punishing crimes that undermine our national security, such as defamation, calumny, incitement to racial hatred and the production of fake treaties and identification cards. Meanwhile, it is the opposition that is committing these crimes.\nWe have made considerable progress in education, health care and infrastructure. Similarly, we have successfully fought AIDS and malaria. We have undertaken a long and difficult fight against corruption. Our Ministries of the Environment and Agriculture are striving to correct the mistakes that have been made with respect to forestry licenses. The poverty rate has dropped every year by 1 per cent and we have experienced an average growth rate of more than 7 per cent since 1994.\nIn Cambodia, we are addressing an issues that can truly hinder sustainable development \u2014 mines and explosive remnants of war. We have made the eradication of these deadly devices an eighteenth Sustainable Development Goal in Cambodia, similar to what we did with the Millennium Development Goals. Our country, which has gained has considerable and painful experience in demining, has been participating in peacekeeping operations by sending demining contingents since 2006. Currently, more than 900 women and men of these contingents, as well as engineers, doctors and military police, are working in Lebanon, Mali, the Central African Republic, the Sudan and South Sudan.\nRegarding climate change, I am pleased to announce that just yesterday we completed the procedure of ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nWe have known the extreme horrors of war. More than others, we understand the price of peace, and we prioritize peaceful conflict resolution in all circumstances, sometimes at the risk of being misunderstood. Lastly, our exceptionally difficult past has made us part and parcel of the network of States that are committed to preventing mass crimes. To that end, and with regard to the responsibility to protect (R2P), we have designated the individual who will be our national correspondent to the Global Network of R2P Focal Points, proposed by the United Nations.\nBased on this assessment, does our country deserve to be subjected to Western obloquy? We will let those present be the judges.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to have been given once again the opportunity to address the Assembly, which is composed of States that are tasked with charting the way forward on a range of issues that impact our collective development and well- being.\nAllow me first to extend congratulations to the President of the General Assembly, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, on his election to lead the Assembly at its seventy-first session. His election comes almost one year after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in which the international community committed to changing its approach to development to one that is people-centred, planet-focused, grounded in the principle of sustainability, and which endorses a balanced approach across the economic, political and social aspects of development. The election of a representative of a small island developing State to the presidency of this body is symbolic of the imperative for universal action and the contribution that must be made by all Members, regardless of size, economy, religion or demography, so as to ensure a trajectory of sustainable growth and development for humankind and life on earth.\nAllow me to also express our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, who as President of the Assembly at its seventieth session further advanced the Office\u2019s high standard of transparency and accountability. Under his stewardship, notable progress was made towards the revitalization of the General Assembly, and its members fully identified\nthe priorities for which action is deemed imperative to ensuring our common journey to 2030.\nThe scope of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covers the multitudinous threats to our collective well-being and the longevity of our civilization. From the existential hazard caused by unmitigated climate change to the insidious threats of violence, extremism and terrorism, to the crises of forced displacement and the spread of infectious diseases and illnesses, such as Ebola, chikungunya and zika, it is clear that the challenges of our time far exceed the limits of geography and demography and therefore diminish the efficacy of unilateral responses. However, as grave as the threats we collectively face, what is even more compelling is the opportunity presented to our United Nations to chart the course of meaningful and universal growth and prosperity by deepening our partnership and cooperation. Such an approach will allow for a reversal of the current patterns of inequality and insecurity and transform our collective circumstances into those that will redound to the benefit of all humanity.\nThe pathway to that transformation lies in the creation of meaningful and innovative partnerships to facilitate the full and universal implementation of the SDGs. The leadership imperative of our time requires that we strike an appropriate balance between national interest and the global good and, accordingly, that we adopt a deeply cooperative and constructive approach to carving out a future of prosperity for our and succeeding generations. I am therefore grateful for the opportunity to address the Assembly yet again and, in this general debate on the aptly selected theme, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, to share the perspectives of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, a small island developing State, as a responsible and committed partner in the multilateral pursuit of a sustainable future.\nA little more than a year ago in this very Hall, Trinidad and Tobago joined other members in adopting the ambitious and inclusive 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and thereby heralded a new phase of enhanced multilateralism in pursuit of a common goal. This groundbreaking Agenda, bolstered by a renewed spirit of global solidarity, compels each of us to join together in international cooperation and partnership to profoundly improve the lives of our fellow humans without discrimination or prejudice.\nHaving adopted the Agenda, we are all now tasked with determining the best way forward for its operationalization and implementation, according to our respective domestic circumstances. As evidence of its unreserved commitment to the achievement of the overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda and the full implementation of the SDGs, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is placing the principles enshrined in the Agenda at the nucleus of its National Development Plan for Trinidad and Tobago, Vision 2030. Our Vision 2030 national plan, currently in the final stages of elaboration, aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that the 2030 Agenda is a transformative plan of action for people, the planet and prosperity through peace and partnership. Accordingly, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago is committed to its full implementation through the mainstreaming of the principles of sustainability throughout its policy spectrum.\nThe thrust of the 2030 Agenda for global transformation, with no one left behind, calls for action to enhance the quality of life of all segments of society, including the systematically marginalized groups. Among them are women, girls and the differently abled, who have historically been denied the equitable access to opportunity and mobility that would have ensured their participation in society as equal partners with men and enhanced not only their own quality of life and happiness, but also that of their families, communities and society as a whole. It is deeply regrettable that women and girls and the differently abled continue to be denied fundamental human rights and freedoms in many parts of the world. Women do not receive equal pay for equal work, and they are systematically prevented from obtaining an education and reaching their full potential as human beings and as citizens.\nTrinidad and Tobago remains committed to raising the standard of living and welfare of all members of the national community, the enhancement of the educational system, improving the delivery of health care and providing a higher level of accessibility and support to persons with disabilities. That commitment has been a long-standing position of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, which has enacted several laws, policies and other measures to promote and strengthen the role of women and girls in society and their overall contribution to national development.\nOne of the defining challenges of our time is that of addressing the issue of climate change and global temperature increase. Notwithstanding the minuscule contribution to absolute global carbon emissions of small island developing States such as Trinidad and Tobago, unmitigated climate change represents an existential threat for us. The future viability and existence of our island State is dependent on the urgency and ambitiousness of the global response to reversing the already unsustainable trend of the global temperature increase. Consequently, Trinidad and Tobago joins the international community in endorsing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as a sign of hope for the future. We especially wish to emphasize that the Agreement prioritizes the need for global action on the critical issue of climate change, an approach which, for us, is absolutely imperative if we are to have a chance of averting its most dangerous effects.\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement signalled to the world that, in the words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \u201cthe spirit of multilateralism is strong\u201d. That spirit must continue to see us through to early entry into force and implementation of the Agreement. In keeping with that sentiment, Trinidad and Tobago joined 174 other Member States in becoming a signatory of the Paris Agreement in April. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that the conversation surrounding the Paris Agreement is now focused on building momentum towards its early entry into force. To that end, the Trinidad and Tobago Government is actively addressing the issue of ratification.\nTrinidad and Tobago also looks forward to deliberations at the upcoming twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Marrakech, Morocco, and to working towards the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and supporting international cooperation on the mitigation, adaptation and compliance on a scale that will ensure that the increase in the average global temperature is limited to 1.5\u00b0C.\nAlthough the economy of Trinidad and Tobago is largely dependent on the hydrocarbon and petrochemical industries, we are committed to the processes under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Accordingly, the Government has instituted incentives to encourage investment and job creation in renewable and clean technologies in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Government has aggressively pursued a national economic diversification strategy, a strategy which will also strengthen Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s resilience to exogenous shocks in global markets. Trinidad and Tobago continues to explore innovative measures to bolster its economic stability and its capacity to remain properly integrated in the global financial and trade architecture.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that national development efforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment through international business activities and finance, international development cooperation and international trade. However, the issue of financial institutions terminating or restricting correspondent banking relations in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) region has destabilized the financial sectors of our member States and has disrupted the region\u2019s growth and economic progress. The cessation of correspondent banking relations by international banks, despite CARICOM compliance with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Global Forum on Taxation, undermines our efforts to truly build a global partnership that will achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago therefore joins its partners in the Caribbean community in calling for international banks to engage in collaboration with affected member States to restore normal financial relationships between domestic banks and international markets.\nThe 2030 Agenda also recognizes that sustainable development can be realized only in a peaceful, secure and stable environment free of war and conflict. Transnational organized crime and violence, piracy, trafficking in persons, cybercrime and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons pose a daunting challenge to the security of all States, but especially small island developing States (SIDS). It is the experience of Trinidad and Tobago, as a small island developing State, and of the Caribbean Community as a whole, that those challenges undermine our efforts to achieve sustainable development, threatening the livelihoods of our people and the rule of law. Such threats can have the potential to affect regional and international peace and security.\nConsequently, at the international level, Trinidad and Tobago, together with CARICOM, fully subscribes to the Arms Trade Treaty, with the aim of preventing armed violence in the region and freeing many from the deadly tyranny associated with a prevalence of unregulated small arms and light weapons. Since 2010, Trinidad and Tobago has also introduced and sponsored General Assembly resolution 68/33, on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, encouraging women\u2019s participation in all disarmament, non-proliferation and arms-control decision-making processes at the local, regional and national levels.\nEnsuring the security, health and social development of our people continues to be a major priority for Trinidad and Tobago. Like many others, our country has not escaped the effects of the illicit drug trade and its associated ills. We have come to realize that in the context of sustainable development, our people\u2019s continued development cannot be divorced from the proliferation of that illicit trade and its concomitant problems. It is widely acknowledged that the world drug problem and the illicit drug economy have the ability to destabilize vulnerable States in many different ways. In order to deal with the problem, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago is using its national development agenda to launch initiatives to mitigate the socioeconomic conditions that are both the cause and result of the problems related to drug use and trafficking. The initiatives are fully aligned with our overall policy direction and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nIt seems fitting that I am addressing the Assembly on 26 September, the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. Trinidad and Tobago would like to stress that using the nuclear option would have severe humanitarian and other devastating consequences for the peoples of the world. We therefore reiterate our call for denuclearizing every region of the world, and we are proud to belong to the region that enshrined the world\u2019s first nuclear-weapon-free zone under the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\nTrinidad and Tobago believes firmly that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against humanity and a violation of international law, including international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations. We lament the fact that, 46 years after the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the international community is still unable to undertake good-faith negotiations on nuclear disarmament. Mutually assured destruction, which is inevitable with the use of nuclear weapons, cannot be a way of settling disputes when both the combatants and several hundred millions of people outside the theatre of war would assuredly perish. Trinidad and Tobago therefore continues to firmly support the call for taking effective measures on nuclear disarmament, including commencing negotiations on an international instrument for prohibiting and eliminating nuclear weapons.\nTrinidad and Tobago is deeply concerned about the growing number of violent extremist acts across the world and the threat that they pose to our shared values of democracy, peace, tolerance and respect for human dignity. While it is important to deal with violent extremism from a security perspective, we should not overlook or dismiss the correlation between violent extremism and development. We remain concerned about the global trend whereby young people fall victim to recruitment by extremist groups, through both online recruitment and other forms of proselytization. To address the problem, we share the view that in order to be as effective as possible, counter-terrorism strategies should include the creation of enabling environments that support the empowerment of young people. That inclusive approach can help to involve them in advocating for the goals of our collective aspirations, thereby reducing the allure of extremist groups.\nTrinidad and Tobago is committed to building an effective global framework for a strategic collective security architecture that addresses the negative social, economic and psychological conditions that give rise to violent extremism, including poverty, violations of human rights and weak governance. That framework must also be supported by a robust international legal system that enables everyone to live freely and in dignity, without fear of persecution, and that affords everyone equal protection before the law, in word and in fact. A robust framework of international law can protect all individuals from acts of violence, war crimes, crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.\nAs a country that was in the vanguard of the efforts to establish the International Criminal Court (ICC), through the pioneering work of the late Arthur Robinson, former Prime Minister and President of Trinidad and Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago remains resolute in its commitment to supporting the mandate of the ICC and its primary objective \u2014 helping to put an end to impunity for perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community and helping to prevent such heinous crimes. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the importance and legitimacy of the ICC in promoting the rule of law, encouraging respect for human rights and achieving sustainable peace and the further development of nations, in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. For those reasons, we urge those countries that have not yet submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court to do so sooner rather than later, so that it can appropriately and completely fulfil its mandate as a universal court.\nTrinidad and Tobago is located in a region that is highly vulnerable to the current unprecedented rate of loss of marine biodiversity and the impact of unsustainable practices on the marine environment, particularly in relation to activities conducted in marine ecosystems beyond areas of national jurisdiction. As such, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago looks forward to the adoption, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), of an international legally binding instrument on the issue of conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We are of the view that a new implementing agreement under UNCLOS should lay a foundation for achieving sustainable development and the protection and sustainable management of the common heritage of humankind for the benefit of present and future generations.\nOn the occasion of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda last year (see A/70/PV.4), Trinidad and Tobago stated that one of the cornerstones of the integrated sustainable development agenda is the development of a multilateral system strategically poised to facilitate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals through multi-stakeholder partnerships. Partnerships undertaken by Governments, international organizations, civil society, the private sector and others provide a vehicle for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, financial resources and technology in order to support the efforts of developing countries to realize sustainable development.\nHowever, middle-income developing countries continue to grapple with a situation that renders them ineligible for international development assistance by virtue of their status, while also coping with the vulnerabilities of being a small island developing State. That is indeed a problem when we consider that our country\u2019s middle-income status, based solely on per capita income, denies Trinidad and Tobago access to international development assistance that could bolster our efforts to accelerate our sustainable and social development. That is the common experience of the Caribbean Community, and indeed of the majority of SIDS. We firmly believe that the United Nations development system should be driven by a multidimensional approach to development assistance that is better tailored to national priorities and specific needs.\nIf the States Members of the United Nations firmly believe that there can be no sustainable development without peace \u2014 and if we all have intentions to keep our promise that no one will be left behind \u2014 then the international community must find a solution to the protracted conflicts, tensions and humanitarian crises occurring across the world.\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to be deeply concerned about the lack of credible progress in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Recognizing the rights of the Palestinian people as well as those of Israel, our Government has consistently expressed its support for a negotiated settlement involving a two-State solution.\nTrinidad and Tobago is also concerned about the ongoing border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela. Given that the two countries have historically maintained a friendly and cooperative relationship, we believe that they should both engage constructively in working towards a peaceful settlement, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\nThe international community is pleased that the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba is making progress. The memory of the first historical visit by a sitting United States President to Havana since the 1959 Cuban revolution will remain in the minds of the people of Cuba and the world for generations, and Trinidad and Tobago continues to be optimistic that the growing relationship between both countries will continue in good faith, and that the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba, which significantly challenges its ability to achieve sustainable development, will be lifted soon.\nSince the adoption of the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), not much has been done to move the process of reforming the Security Council forward. Trinidad and Tobago remains concerned about the fact that the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform have seen little progress since 2008. We therefore urge all Member States to work collaboratively, in the spirit of compromise and for the benefit of all States, to achieve reform of the Security Council so as to enable it to better address current realities, thereby improving the functioning and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago, I wish to express our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose term as the eighth Secretary-General comes to a close at the end of this year. Mr. Ban has initiated many sweeping changes and reforms at the Secretariat designed to make the Organization an ever more dynamic body capable of responding to the emerging needs and challenges facing its diverse membership. At a time of escalating international terrorism and the increasingly urgent need for decisive action on climate change, as well as of criticisms of the efficacy of the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations, his outstanding efforts and leadership have been instrumental in shaping the future of multilateralism. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement are just two examples of an exceptional record of achievements, not to mention his groundbreaking initiative earlier this year to convene the first ever World Humanitarian Summit, in collaboration with the Government of Turkey, in the beautiful city of Istanbul.\nAs the United Nations continues its search for a successor, Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the next Secretary-General must be held to the highest possible standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, with proven leadership and diplomatic skills. It is the responsibility of the next Secretary-General to help realize the extraordinary expectations embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals, to address the burgeoning challenges of the forced migration of refugees and violent extremism, and to transform the United Nations into a global institution that is effective, relevant and fit for purpose.\nThe universal push to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and transform our world is the responsibility of every State Member of the United Nations. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its commitment to the Charter and its principles. We will continue to work closely with our family of nations in the pursuit of international peace and security, human rights and sustainable development for every single human being. While we may look different, speak different languages and face different challenges, humankind shares a common beginning and a common future. In the words of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\n\u201cbeneath the surface of States and nations, ideas and language, lies the fate of individual human beings in need. Answering their needs will be the mission of the United Nations in the century to come\u201d.\nTogether, let our answer resonate for generations.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Botswana, Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, allow me to join previous speakers in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I also pay homage to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft.\nMy delegation fully endorses the pertinent choice of theme for this session, namely, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. We are aware of the need for and importance of reviewing, monitoring and evaluating the progress made in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals over the next 15 years, which has been one of the main lessons learned from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nBotswana has long recognized that, in order to achieve sustainable development, there must be national ownership. It must be based on inclusive, accountable, democratic and strong institutions and processes. For Botswana, adherence to those principles, together with the judicious exploitation of natural resources and international development support, has enabled us to achieve what we have achieved in the 50 years since our independence.\nIn a week, on 30 September, Botswana will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary of independence. I would once again like to remind the Assembly that in 1966 we were among the poorest nations of the world, with a gross domestic product per capita of approximately $70. Since then we have managed to attain middle-income status.\nWhen we, like the rest of Africa, told the world that we were ready for self-governance, many sceptics, historians and commentators \u2014 including many in Africa \u2014 thought of us as a basket case that was neither ready for, nor capable of, real independence. In fact, on 28 September 1966, two days before we joined the community of sovereign nations, one cynical Canadian journalist, a certain Mr. Charles King of the Southern News Service, wrote an article entitled \u201cBechuanaland Poor, Hungry Desert Land, Independence to Come Friday\u201d, observing that\n\u201cThe new blue, white and black flags are flying everywhere in Gaberones, its incongruous capital city. But elsewhere in the vast, trackless wasteland that will take the name of Botswana there is little to celebrate.\u201d\nHe continued:\n\u201cTwo years of disastrous drought and crop failure have brought havoc and hunger to its widely scattered agricultural inhabitants. More than one fifth of the population is literally being kept alive by emergency feeding, and the numbers are rapidly increasing ...\n\u201cIt also has debts and economic misery. It is destined to be an international charity case forever, exporting its ablest men and its cattle in exchange for cash and kindness from abroad.\u201d\nWith about 3 kilometres of paved roads in the entire country, with 42 graduates, a few primary schools, a single railway line, operated by neighbouring hostile and white-minority-ruled then-Rhodesia, and one national radio station, which broadcast for two hours a day, ours is a country born out of humble beginnings, from which we managed our own development. Having joined the United Nations in 1966, together with Lesotho, Guyana and Barbados, we are proud and contented to look back on the experiment we started and see that it was well worth the try. From next to nothing, we placed a high premium on building a united, democratic and accountable nation premised on respect for democracy, human rights, the rule of law and strong institutions.\nConscious of the prevailing circumstances and challenges, we chose to base the development of our society on four key national development principles, that is, democracy, development, unity and self- reliance. As we reflect on our challenges and the modest achievements that we have made, we are proud of the fact that we are among Africa\u2019s most stable democracies, having held free, fair and peaceful multiparty elections every five years without interruption. It is our every intention to continue along that path.\nIn celebrating 50 years of independent nationhood, we are conscious of the fact that we could not have achieved all those milestones without the much-needed support and solidarity of the international community. For that we shall forever remain grateful to our reliable global partners, who have stood with us throughout the challenging journey. We have today made great strides and achievements in the areas of education, health care, infrastructure and human-resource development, as well as women and youth empowerment. Those achievements, however, should not make us complacent.\nLike many nations, Botswana is already feeling the adverse impact of climate change. Such impact is manifested in a decline in agricultural production, rising food insecurity and increasing water stress, all of which are projected to worsen with time. The threat must not be underestimated. Urgent and effective global action on climate change, mitigation and adaptation is required to avoid the catastrophic consequences of global warming. The seventy-first session of the General Assembly provides a strategic opportunity for injecting much needed-political momentum into the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda, which this organ unanimously adopted exactly one year ago.\nThe recent high-level event on large movements of refugees and migrants, held just a few days ago, is a stark reminder of the challenges we continue to face as a planet. While we commend all States that take on the burden of receiving displaced people, that is not the only answer. More effort should be put into addressing the problem and finding solutions in the countries from which they come. Clearly, the current situation of receiving such people serves only to encourage others to follow their predecessors.\nAs a member of the community of nations that cherishes freedom, peace and the fulfilment and enjoyment of life, Botswana remains deeply concerned about the many acts of terror, conflict and human suffering that have precipitated the vast and large displacement of people across the globe. In that regard, we are concerned about the protracted Syrian crisis, which could have been contained had the Security Council and the international community intervened promptly. History will judge us harshly, for we have allowed the situation to degenerate into what it is today. However, we are well aware that Al-Assad, as well as his system, which slaughters the innocent, is not the only party committing crimes against humanity.\nWe are equally concerned about, and strongly condemn, the continued blatant contravention of international law and United Nations resolutions by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea through its callous testing of ballistic missiles. To demonstrate our abhorrence, Botswana terminated its diplomatic relations with that rogue State. In fact, in our opinion, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Syria do not deserve membership of this world body, owing to their lack of respect for, and adherence to, the values and principles that they committed to uphold.\nAs a community of nations bound by universal ideals and a shared moral ethos, it would be a dereliction of our responsibilities if we did not hold one another accountable in the event of breaches of the very fundamental values of human rights that the Organization is committed to uphold. In the light of the increasing security threats, we call upon the Security Council, as the organ responsible for maintaining international peace and security, to demonstrate seriousness in executing that important mandate. It can no longer be acceptable to hide behind the veto while millions of innocent lives are lost.\nWe continue to express our sympathies to those afflicted by disasters such as earthquakes, floods and other natural calamities. We extend our condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in the past year. In that regard, we wish to commend civil society for its tireless efforts in providing humanitarian aid to those in dire need. In the same vein, we reiterate our long-held belief, which is shared by many, and in line with the hallowed principle of the responsibility to protect, that States have the primary responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We commend human rights organizations\u2019 work in exposing such violations wherever they occur in the world.\nAs a staunch supporter of the International Criminal Court, we stand by all efforts to fight impunity and strengthen the international criminal justice system in order to bring justice to the victims of such crimes. We urge all States signatories of the Rome Statute to uphold their commitments.\nIt is crucial that we step up our efforts in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) in order to effectively protect women and children in armed conflict and involve them at all levels and processes of mediation, peacekeeping, peace maintenance, reconstruction and development, given the fact that they suffer most from the effects of armed conflict. As a peace-loving nation, Botswana reaffirms its abiding faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the various multilateral instruments under international humanitarian law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nLet me conclude by commending Brazil for hosting a successful Olympic Games despite criticisms in some quarters that predicted failure while disseminating messages of fear linking the Games with the issues of, inter alia, the zika virus and terrorism. In a related matter, we strongly condemn the International Paralympic Committee for its blanket ban of Russian athletes. Botswana does not condone doping in any way, but to punish clean athletes is discrimination. Those who participate in the Paralympic Games are disabled, and the Games are a way of including them in the mainstream and helping them overcome their challenges. For a body that was set up specifically to show compassion and caring to treat people like that is indeed a gross injustice. We believe that there is an agenda beyond its stated reasons for doing so.\nI wish to reaffirm Botswana\u2019s continued commitment to playing its full part in the quest for international peace and security, as well as to the international community\u2019s unrelenting efforts to make the world a safer and more prosperous place for both present and future generations.\nFinally, as we are in the United States of America, we wish the people of America successful elections in November. We hope that the person who emerges victorious will be someone who is known to be tolerant and who embraces all people. Allow me, in the same breath, to return in equal measure the accolades extended to us by President Obama. We in Botswana fully recognize, remain confident in and exalt the leadership of President Obama. These indeed have been eight glorious years \u2014 the best years for the United States of America and Africa by any measure. We wish him well and a well-deserved retirement.\nIn the spirit of the Charter, and as inspired by the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, let us push to transform our world and leave no one behind.\n"

As we celebrate the first anniversary of the adoption of these important instruments, we are pleased to see that the world and the United Nations system have been making progress with their implementation.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the collective ambition for and global consensus on the importance of accelerating the creation of the conditions for ensuring that our efforts to eradicate poverty and build sustainable development are people-centred. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) therefore represent a tool with enormous potential for triggering profound changes in our vision for development and ensuring that no country or individual is left behind.\nThe major challenge to the Sustainable Development Goals lies in their implementation, particularly with regard to their alignment with global, regional and national instruments and resources, their financing, monitoring and evaluation of progress, and their inclusiveness. By integrating the dimension of peace and stability, the Sustainable Development Goals acknowledge the inseparability of peace and development and the need for each to be strengthened. Only in this way can we build peaceful, just and inclusive societies, for which genuine political will is required. For this process to succeed, we urgently need to reposition the United Nations system so that it can respond to current realities.\nThere can be no doubt that the global transformation that the SDGs are aiming to achieve will require structural changes in the way we design and implement our major national development agendas in the short, medium and long term. In that regard, Mozambique\u2019s 2015-2019 five-year Government programme, our blueprint for governance, already reflects some of the principles and the three dimensions of sustainable development.\nIn order to mainstream, monitor and report on our implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, we recently established a national reference group comprising representatives from the Government, Parliament, civil society, the private sector and cooperating partners. The group\u2019s task is to follow up on progress on the indicators selected to assess targets up to 2030, as well as to deal with policy measures, funding possibilities and any factor that may have an effect on the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Through the group\u2019s broad-based intervention, our goal is to make the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals more inclusive, consistent and transparent, and something which all the various stakeholders can feel part of.\nThe third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in July 2015, recommended that countries use their own frameworks and means to respond to the new development agenda. The Conference advised Member States to develop comprehensive and integrated funding strategies that go beyond traditional procedures for public budgeting. In that context, and as part of our commitment to continuing to mobilize more resources, Mozambique has established a national fund for sustainable development. In addition, we have begun evaluating the flow of development financing, with the aim, on the one hand, of facilitating a system for viewing the development results for each of the country\u2019s available financial flows, and, on the other hand, of exploring options for the coherent integration of Government priorities with those of the international agenda.\nTo complement the foregoing efforts, we continue to urge the revitalization of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development and support for the relevance of the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility. We also advocate for the importance of ensuring that partners honour their commitments undertaken within the framework of the internationally agreed development goals and of the predictability of development aid, based on the provisions of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. With the help of those tools we will be able to establish sound institutional foundations for the efficient and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, helping to fulfil the \u201cuniversal push to transform our world\u201d.\nMaking our global agenda a reality requires a collective commitment on the part of all of us to strengthening multilateral institutions. To that end, we continue to believe firmly in the importance of reforming the United Nations as a whole and the Security Council in particular, as well as changing the architecture of international financial institutions on the basis of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and improving cooperation between the United Nations and regional economic organizations, particularly where the prevention and resolution of conflicts are concerned.\nAs we meet today in this Hall, we reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, a universal Organization with a mandate to maintain international peace and security and to defend human rights. We recognize the United Nations as an essential platform for political and diplomatic discussion and international cooperation on peace and development. In that regard, we would like to express our appreciation for the excellent and successful job that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has done in completing his mandate to lead the Organization for two terms. We hope that under its soon-to-be-elected incoming Secretary-General, the United Nations will strengthen its relations with Mozambique, particularly in terms of helping us to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. We also look forward to seeing the implementation of reforms that will make our Organization more democratic, more representative and better able to serve all nations and peoples of the world.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our commitment to continuing our exemplary cooperation with the United Nations and all its Member States in order to achieve our noble objectives, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals, and to build a prosperous, peaceful world for the benefit of all its peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my great pleasure, in my personal capacity as well as on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of the Sudan, to convey my desire for the successful outcome of these deliberations during this important session of the General Assembly. Our agenda is one of hope for a better and more prosperous future. We must consider the issues of peace and security, development, human rights, and humanitarian matters in particular.\nIt is also my pleasure to express my congratulations to Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I would also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for the skilful and wise manner in which he led the work of the Assembly at the previous session.\nThe high-level general debate of this session is taking place under the theme \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. That reflects the interest of the United Nations in realizing the hopes and aspirations of our countries and our peoples, in achieving sustainable development and prosperity for future generations, in eradicating poverty and disparities among people, and in protecting our planet and promoting sustainable development through international partnerships, where all stakeholders are involved. We hope that all stakeholders will respect their commitments to achieve that objective in order to avoid the repercussions of poverty, for we are aware that poverty, regardless of where it is, threatens prosperity throughout the world.\nMy country today reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We reaffirm our interest in the need to continue efforts to reform this institution and develop its structures. We hope that the regional coalitions calling for General Assembly and Security Council reform do not go unheeded, so that the United Nations can truly become a platform for the implementation of international legality and a guarantor of justice and development throughout our world. I would like to reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to dialogue with the international community aimed at strengthening values such as international justice and the fight against impunity through international mechanisms that are neither selective nor politicized.\nIn our view it is clear that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which should seek to enforce justice throughout the world, in fact hinders peace in its practical reality. That can be seen in the regions where it undertakes action, particularly in Africa. The African States therefore call for the drafting of a plan to collectively withdraw from the ICC. It is crucial that a distinction be drawn between justice and the politicization of justice.\nTo achieve peace, we have to strive to work together. This is one of our favourite topics. I would like to express our gratitude to all those who have endeavoured to achieve this very noble objective. Furthermore, I can confirm that we are going to knock on every single door of peace, and dialogue will be the only solution. Accordingly, my Government has spared no effort to ensure that peace prevails. Today, we are strengthening our social fabric and continuing our efforts aimed at rebuilding my country.\nThanks to God and thanks to the determination of my country and of the loyal people of the Sudan, Darfur has become a safe region, where peace and security have prevailed. The United Nations is a witness to this fact. The Government of the Sudan calls for the implementation of the plan for the withdrawal of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). I would like to reaffirm from this high rostrum that the Government of the Sudan reiterates its call to have UNAMID forces withdraw, for there are no more reasons for their presence there. Those forces could be deployed elsewhere to serve to consolidate peace in the parts of the world that truly need it.\nThe theme of the general debate of this session is \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. To achieve the objectives, purposes and principles implicit in this theme, we need to act together.\nWe also need to act together to achieve genuine momentum in bridging the food gap around the world. In this regard, I would like to recall the food security initiative launched by the President of the Republic, Mr. Omar Hassan Al-Bashir, during the third Arab Economic and Social Development Summit, in 2013. This initiative, which was subsequently adopted at the Sharm El-Sheikh summit in 2016, serves as one of the pillars for food security around the world. I call upon the United Nations and all specialized agencies to carry out the necessary studies to ensure the success of this initiative. We in the Sudan possess the necessary capabilities and skills to move forward on this universal push and stand ready to do so.\nWe wish to fulfil our commitments to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with a view to guaranteeing a dignified life for all. But given the unjustified unilateral sanctions and the burden of our foreign debt, which stands at over $40 billion, that will not be easy. When one looks at the interest to be paid and the very complex contractual provisions, it is quite clear that 40 per cent of this debt is nothing more than interest growing on a yearly basis. That debt naturally hampers our country and its economic capabilities. In addition, the Sudan is not able to benefit from international financial support initiatives.\nI would also like to state here that the agreement on the zero option for foreign debt, which we signed after South Sudan split from the Republic of the Sudan, terminated in 2014. The agreement was renewed for two years, but it is coming to an end this month, without the international commitments on our debts having been met since 2005. No progress has been made in terms of writing off those debts, even though my country was eligible for it.\nThe Sudan condemns the phenomenon of terrorism, which is why we have to deploy all our efforts and coordinate with other countries to contain the phenomenon. What do we need to do? We need to tackle the roots of the problem by finding just solutions for the international problems that fuel terrorism: exclusion, marginalization and the failure to uphold the rights of people who have been deprived of them. To that end, we have hosted a number of workshops, seminars and forums, the most recent of which was entitled \u201cThe Role of the Arab Media in Countering Terrorism\u201d. At that forum, held in Khartoum in August, the Khartoum Declaration was adopted. It reaffirms the importance of combating terrorism, the central role of religious discourse, and the need to ensure that educational curriculums focuses on tolerance and acceptance of the other. The media need to be used in the right way to fight this scourge.\nUnfortunately, the future of our planet hinges on the fight against such phenomena as the trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organized crime. These phenomena will be eradicated only if we pool the efforts of the international community and if the States of the world cooperate to stop these evils.\nBecause of the geographical situation of the Sudan, some have tried to take advantage of my country by making it a platform for trafficking in human beings and drug trafficking. With the help of the international community, we are doing everything we can to fight this exploitation, particularly by strengthening our law- enforcement capabilities and drafting the necessary\nlegislation to improve communication and coordination. Thanks be to God, we have made significant progress in this area despite the lack of resources.\nIsrael continues to reject all initiatives aimed at achieving the two-State solution, which is why we have to do everything we can to terminate the last colonial regime in the world. We have to work to implement the two-State solution and create a sovereign Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nWe attach the greatest importance to the safety, security and stability of South Sudan, for we have historical blood ties with that country. Together with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and with our partners on the African continent and in the international community we will spare no effort to back our brothers in South Sudan and ensure that peace and security prevail in that country.\nWith an eye to calming all other hotbeds of tension around the world, we call for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria. We must move away from any solution that involves force. We must preserve the territorial integrity of Syria. With respect to Yemen, we reaffirm our support to the Government of President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour. With respect to Libya, we reaffirm our support for the Government of President Faiez Mustafa Serraj and will spare no effort to preserve the territorial integrity, security and stability of the country and protect its resources.\nI also wish to reaffirm the basic principle of our foreign policy, which is non-interference in the affairs of others. We reaffirm our support for the stability of South Sudan and the Central African Republic. We call upon the international community to spare no effort and to leave no stone unturned in helping these countries overcome the difficulties they are facing. The Sudan calls for dialogue and the renunciation of the use of force when it comes to managing and settling conflicts around the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin my statement by congratulating Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, thanking Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his work at the previous session and commending Secretary-General Ban Ki- Moon for his leadership in ushering in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThis year, Guatemala is celebrating two anniversaries that have characterized the political life of our country: 30 years of the Esquipulas peace process in Central America, and 20 years since the signature on 29 December 1996 of the Agreement on a firm and lasting peace. The Esquipulas agreements opened the door to political dialogue and negotiations and closed it to a geopolitical conflagration of unimaginable consequences in Central America.\nThe peace agreements in Guatemala marked not only the definitive ceasefire but also the creation of an agenda of far-reaching legal, institutional and cultural reforms. Guatemala has evolved since then, and the path to fulfilling those agreements has made a significant contribution to the country\u2019s development and modernization.\nNonetheless, some commitments have been postponed or are lagging, and now is precisely the time to evaluate and revitalize them. I am referring to critical issues, such as the identity and rights of indigenous people, rural development and the participation of women in all spheres of our society.\nWe acknowledge and are grateful for the support received from the United Nations and the Office of the Secretary-General, from the peace negotiation process to the monitoring of the implementation of the agreements concluded by the parties, including valuable support for the strengthening of democratic institutions. We recognize that the United Nations devoted an entire decade of laudable and patient efforts to the building of peace in my country.\nThe year 2015 changed the course of history in Guatemala. The people of Guatemala demonstrated their profound malaise with the State authorities that were betraying the Constitution. They categorically rejected the perverse system of corruption that had been sabotaging our development potential. Their\nmalaise was expressed democraticall, and I can state firmly that, after five consecutive months of peaceful demonstrations in town squares, the rule of law operates more robustly now than it did a year ago, and the people, who week after week took to the streets to protest and make their just and ethical demands, are now more confident in their own transformative power and their ability to create a different kind of country.\nThe International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala played a catalysing and important role in changing the course of our country\u2019s history. The Commission is a Guatemalan initiative that was duly welcomed by the General Assembly and the Secretariat. It has become one of the most efficient tools of multilateral cooperation in the fight against the networks of crime and corruption that have co-opted strategic parts of States that, like Guatemala, have been challenged by the geopolitics of transnational organized crime.\nMy Government, which took office in January, owes its existence to the citizens\u2019 rejection of the old way of conducting politics. It represents the hope for a return to democratic governance that is ethically based on the common good and not on subordination to special interests. Such are the expectations that our honourable citizenry has placed in me. I must now strive to be the worthy son of such people by doing my bit in the moral and material reconstruction of the nation.\nTo meet the wishes of our citizens in their quest to transform the country, my Government has identified five strategic areas: transparency, health care, education, security and development.\nWith regard to transparency, we have committed to a policy of zero tolerance on corruption. To that end, open government has become a fundamental pillar of our Administration, based on transparency, collaboration and participation, and pursuant to the provisions of the inter-American and United Nations conventions against corruption. We know that corruption hampers development, weakens institutions and undermines the modernization of the State. That is why it is vital to combat that scourge.\nWith regard to public health, we are promoting the necessary reforms through strategic efforts focused on improving access for everyone and making primary care the core of the system. We are restoring the supply of medicines and the efficient funcioning of hospitals and strengthening our human resource capacity. My Government\u2019s priorities include reducing chronic malnutrition in children under five and maternal mortality. Today, we must sadly acknowledge that 5 out of every 10 children suffer from chronic malnutrition in my country, which in turn leads to extreme poverty. They have the choice of working from a young age on farms, turning to crime or migrating to the United States. We have therefore designed a national strategy to prevent chronic malnutrition as part of our food and nutrition security policy.\nAs for education, our responsibility is to ensure that every child has access to free, high-quality education, with a view to benefiting children and young people in Guatemala through comprehensive education programmes.\nIn the area of public safety, we have focused our attention on lowering rates of violence, delinquency and crime, using prevention policies as part of a comprehensive approach. We have been able to coordinate considerable efforts to deliver greater security to the population and strengthen the investigation and prevention capabilities of our police force, which has allowed us, in various ways, to lower rates of violent death.\nGuatemala reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations and reiterates its multilateral and peaceful mission, convinced that global challenges, such as security, development, respect for human rights and climate change, should be addressed through dialogue and collective negotiation, as part of the global system. For Guatemala, human rights are intrinsically linked to respect, democracy and the rule of law. For that reason, strengthening the international human rights system is one of my Government\u2019s main priorities, and we are committed to promoting the highest international standards in that area through active participation in various forums. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the international community for its support of my country\u2019s declaration of candidacy to the Human Rights Council for the period 2017-2019.\nMy country recognizes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encompasses a transformative vision and provides a road map with Goals, targets and indicators to tackle the challenges that face humankind. Guatemala endorses the 2030 Agenda; it is aligned with the national development plan K\u2019atun, Our Guatemala 2032, which was developed with the participation of various sectors of society in a resumption of medium- and long-term planning. Being aware that it is impossible to achieve sustainable development if we do not ensure the preservation of our planet\u2019s resources, my country did not hesitate in adopting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which I had the honour of signing on 22 April in this very Hall.\nI wish to express my deep respect and admiration for every single Guatemalan migrant who, through sacrifice and hard work, helps to support his or her family and Guatemala\u2019s development, as well as contributing to the development of the country in which he or she resides. These people really are unsung heroes, exemplary citizens. They live in every corner of the world, and they have rights and are entitled to be treated with greater dignity. It is for that reason that during my country\u2019s statement at the high-level meeting to address large movements of refugees and migrants (see A/71/PV.6 B), we were emphatic in our commitment to the promotion, protection and defence of the human rights of migrants and their families, regardless of their migration status, in origin, transit and destination countries.\nGuatemala contends that multilateralism and the promotion of international law are indispensable in solving the problems facing our community of nations, and we hope that peaceful solutions can be found to overcome the differences between States. Guatemala is promoting cooperation schemes and good-neighbourliness in its surrounding area. I wish to express my country\u2019s deep commitment to resolving once and for all, at the International Court of Justice, its land, island and maritime dispute with Belize, a country with which we aspire to have a privileged relationship and to maintain permanent dialogue, as a way to solve our common problems.\nIn recent months, however, the Government of Belize has failed to reciprocate that attitude. Since 1999, the situation has claimed 10 Guatemalan civilian victims in the adjacency zone administered by Belize. On 20 April, a 14-year-old boy was the victim of a fatal attack by armed groups under the command of an army patrol from Belize. According to Belize\u2019s forensic report, the child died from multiple wounds caused by bullets from a high-powered rifle. Guatemalan forensic services confirmed that the child had nine bullet wounds \u2014 six in his back, two in the back of his neck and one on the front of his torso.\nSuch grave acts directly harm our two countries\u2019 bilateral relationship and hinder confidence-building. I wish to reaffirm the desire of the State of Guatemala to find a permanent solution to the dispute with Belize within the framework of international law, while also reminding the international community of the risks to international security that the continuous deadlock and disputed geographical demarcation pose. It is no secret that powerful transnational criminal organizations thrive on the differences between States and are capable of occupying pockets of undefined territories that lack effective control.\nToday\u2019s general debate comes at a time when we are facing serious threats to peace and stability in various countries \u2014 Iraq, Mali, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Central African Republic, the Sudan and South Sudan, to name but a few. The nuclear tests recently carried out on the Korean peninsula constitute a flagrant violation of Security Council resolutions and the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and we reiterate our strong condemnation of them.\nI wish to stress that, for my country, peacekeeping operations and international security represent the ideal of serving under the flag of the United Nations, in an effort to support fellow countries. We are currently contributing to seven operations: in Haiti, Lebanon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Sudan, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nWe are also honoured to be part of the special political mission in Colombia, one of Guatemala\u2019s neighbouring countries, to support the agreement to end the current conflict through a bilateral and permanent ceasefire, the surrender of weapons, security guarantees and an endorsement mechanism for the peace agreements. I congratulate the people and the Government of Colombia on that important achievement. We recognize the part played by the leadership of President Santos in the process and the contribution of the Government of Cuba to it. I also commend the intention to soon hold a plebiscite for the people of Colombia to ratify the peace agreements.\nI wish to conclude both by congratulating all those who contribute to peace and by stating that the General Assembly allows us, as leaders, to reflect and ask ourselves if we are fulfilling the founding promise of the Organization to save succeeding generations from\n16-29559 21/28 the scourge of war, to promote social progress, to live in peace as good neighbours and, finally, to unite our strength to universally transform our world and succeed in not leaving anyone behind.\n"

I assure him of South Africa\u2019s continued support in the implementation of his priorities and responsibilities throughout his term. We also commend Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark for his able stewardship of the General Assembly during its historic seventieth session.\nThe year 2016 is an important year in South Africa, as we mark two significant historic anniversaries in our country. We recently marked the sixtieth anniversary of the 1956 Women\u2019s March against discriminatory and racist laws, and the fortieth anniversary of the youth uprising against apartheid of 16 June 1976. Those two events marked significant turning points in the history of our struggle against apartheid minority rule in our country. The Women\u2019s March brought into sharp focus the gender dimension of the struggle and the equal role of women in the fight against white domination, oppression and injustice. Equally, the youth uprising 40 years ago highlighted and cemented the role of young people in fighting for liberation and a better society.\nWe are reminded of those two milestones as we address the theme of this debate: \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. Last year, world leaders marked the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations by adopting the 2030 Agenda, that is, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We committed ourselves to an ambitious and transformative global development programme that seeks to address the triple challenge of this century, which is poverty, unemployment and inequality. To a great extent, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) played a critical role in galvanizing Governments and communities all over the world to put in place programmes and policies aimed at poverty eradication and addressing socioeconomic development, particularly in Africa.\nIt is a well-known reality that our continent, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, did not achieve the targets that were set in the MDGs. It was for that reason that we insisted that the Sustainable Development Goals should continue the unfinished business of the MDGs. We therefore have an interest in ensuring the full implementation of the SDGs as we take forward the agenda of promoting Africa\u2019s sustainable development.\nWe have made significant strides in the past couple of decades in reversing the impact of underdevelopment and the legacies of colonialism and apartheid in Africa. If the African continent is to develop faster, we need to address certain constraints. That includes inadequate infrastructure; high dependency on primary products; high exposure to commodity-price volatility; limited investment in research and development, science, innovation and technology; and low private-sector investment, as well as the need to continue improving skills. To respond to some of those constraints, the continent has embarked upon a number of initiatives, including the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development, the Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative, the African Mining Vision and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa.\nIn South Africa, we have put in place a national development plan that is aligned with both Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the Sustainable Development Goals. At the core of our development plan is a focus on poverty eradication and raising the standard of living of our people. Our national development plan is also in line with the drive for the industrialization of Africa. That will contribute to eradicating poverty and reducing inequality and unemployment, and will also contribute to global growth and prosperity. It is therefore imperative that Africa and the least developed countries, which were left behind in previous industrialisation processes, not be excluded from the fourth, or new, industrial revolution.\nThe successful implementation of Africa\u2019s development plans depends on the availability of resources. We are therefore seriously concerned about the loss of the continent\u2019s resources through illicit financial flows. The joint African Union-United Nations Economic Commission for Africa High-level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa estimates that illicit flows from Africa could amount to as much as $50 billion per year. Illicit financial flows deprive developing countries of economic resources that are much needed to uplift their economies in order to provide infrastructure and basic services, such as education and health care. We urge the world at large to treat this problem with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves.\nWe also need to close the gap that has painfully divided people between rich and the poor and divided countries between big and small economies. Global inequality and economic exclusion have become a serious threat to global peace and stability. Inclusive growth is therefore a peace, security and prosperity imperative. However, inclusive growth will remain a distant dream if powerful nations continue to put their national interests ahead of the global collective interest.\nThe African continent remains committed, through the African Union and its Peace and Security Architecture, to resolving the remaining conflicts. We have committed ourselves to silencing the guns by 2020. We appeal to the Security Council in particular to support African peace operations so that we can achieve that noble goal. The situations in Libya, South Sudan and the Central African Republic remain a continental priority. We strongly urge the Security Council to better align and coordinate with the African Union in efforts to bring about peace in those sister countries and on the continent at large.\nBeyond the continent, we remain concerned about threats of terrorism. Fifteen years after the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States, international terrorism remains a challenge that no single country or region has been able to deal with successfully. We have witnessed the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and are horrified by its brutal and senseless killings. The conflicts in both Libya and Syria have provided fertile ground for the terrorists to carry out their unjustified terrorist activities.\nIn less than five years, the conflict in Syria has led to chaos in that country, with a devastating effect on the stability of the region. The deadlock in the Security Council on the Syrian question exposes the inherent structural dysfunction of the 1945 post-Second World War consensus. We must therefore ask ourselves if the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council as currently configured, can fulfil its mandate in addressing the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThe Security Council is supposed to act in our collective interests, without being bogged down by the narrow domestic interests of a few States. It is imperative and urgent that the United Nations be reformed, and in particular the Council. South Africa has been calling, and will continue to call, for fundamental reform of the Security Council in order to ensure the representation of Africa. One billion people cannot continue to be denied a voice in this manner.\nThe lack of progress in finding a durable solution to the Palestinian question and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\u2019s struggle for self-determination remains of major concern for us. It is important that the United Nations carry out its historic mission to ensure that the two longest-standing decolonization and occupation issues are resolved once and for all, in fulfilment of the objectives set forth under the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe signing of the Paris Agreement last year marked a historic moment in humankind\u2019s resolve to minimize the impact of climate change and address the human contribution to it. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the extraordinary leadership that he provided since the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Copenhagen. He was unwavering in his commitment to seeing a legally binding agreement finally agreed to by all. The adoption of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, during the seventeenth Conference of the Parties, was a historic milestone and marked a turning point in the negotiation of a legally binding instrument. It provided a clear road map with targets and deadlines.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of South Africa, I would to take this opportunity to salute the outgoing Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the sterling and outstanding manner in which he steered the affairs of the Organization in the past decade. We wish him well in his future endeavours.\nWe are pleased that for the first time in the history of the United Nations the General Assembly has been at the centre of the process of finding a new Secretary- General. We believe in a balanced and equal role between the two principal organs of the United Nations on the question of the selection of the Secretary-General. The General Assembly, as the most representative organ, representing all the aspirations of the peoples of the world, should be central in determining the right man or woman to lead the United Nations into the future. The General Assembly cannot be expected just to rubber-stamp decisions of the Security Council. South Africa is particularly supportive of the proposal to limit the term of office of the Secretary-General to a seven- year non-renewable term in order to allow him or her to work without being concerned about reappointment.\nSouth Africa looks forward to working with the President of the General Assembly and other Member States throughout this session.\n"

        "file_text": "As I address the General Assembly in this Hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we have made these last eight years. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We have taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the non-proliferation regime and resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America\u2019s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa and promote models of development rather than dependence. We have made international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.\nThis is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together. Yet around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order. We see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security and basic order have broken down. We see too many Governments muzzling journalists, quashing dissent and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law.\nThis is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, unease and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.\nI therefore believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation, tribe, race or religion. I want to suggest today that we must go forward and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets, accountable governance, democracy, human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts \u2014 facts that all too often we forget in the immediacy of current events.\nThis is the most important fact: the integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 per cent of humanity to under 10 per cent. That is unprecedented, and it is not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers do not die in childbirth.\nMeanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand- held device. In medicine and manufacturing, in education and communications, we are experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. As a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, live longer and have access to opportunity than at any time in human history. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears to be in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.\nIn remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves and has raised people\u2019s expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great Powers no longer fight world wars, that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon, that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union and that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.\nI say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress. In order to move forward, however, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. All too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations, have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities, and have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded and underresourced for handling transnational challenges.\nAs these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism \u2014 sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right \u2014 which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.\nWe cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel, technology and telecommunications \u2014 together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain \u2014 makes it ultimately self-defeating for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.\nThe answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure that the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the economic, political and cultural disruptions that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together.\nIt starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets and capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization, combined with rapid progress in technology, has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.\nIn developing countries, labour organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by Governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. Meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable \u2014 nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, the shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.\nA world in which 1 per cent of humankind controls as much wealth as the other 99 per cent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others\u2019. Expectations rise then \u2014 faster than Governments can deliver \u2014 and a pervasive sense of injustice undermines people\u2019s faith in the system.\nSo how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind immigration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market- distorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbour policies and overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they are more likely to lead to conflict. The stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that the central planned control of the economy is a dead end.\nBut I do believe there is another path, one that fuels growth and innovation and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. That means respecting the rights of workers so that they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people, their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks to look for a new job or start a new venture.\nThese are the policies that I pursued here in the United States and with clear results. American businesses have now created 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top 1 per cent of Americans were capturing more than 90 per cent of income growth, but today that is down to roughly half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. With further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I am confident that such progress will continue.\nSo just as I pursued these measures here at home, so the United States has worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism, not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That is why we have worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation, because a society that asks less of oligarchs than of ordinary citizens will rot from within.\nThat is why we have pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they are fuelled by hard work and not the capacity to extort and bribe. That is why we have worked to reach trade agreements that raise labour standards and raise environmental standards, as we have done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared.\nJust as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, so I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It is difficult to spend on foreign assistance, but I do not believe this is charity. For a small fraction of what we spent on the war in Iraq, we could support institutions so that fragile States do not collapse in the first place and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do.\nThat is why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we do not act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, cities submerged, nations displaced, food supplies decimated and conflicts borne of despair. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambitions. There must be a sense of urgency about bringing the Agreement into force and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.\nFor the wealthiest countries, therefore, a green climate fund should be just the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies and then make those technologies accessible and affordable for poor countries. Only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair it.\nWe therefore need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. In the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I recognize that not every country in this Hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can or should impose our system of government on other countries, but there appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order, an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.\nI know that some countries that now recognize the power of free markets still reject the model of free societies. Perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the cold war, because we have learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out that building accountable institutions is hard work, the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial Powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game.\nSo, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it is no surprise that some argue that the future favours the strong man, a top-down model, rather than strong democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe that the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that, in the twenty-first century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up, because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent, young people need a global education in order to thrive, independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, the expectations of people will ultimately not be met. Suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strong men are then left with two paths: permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\nI will admit that my belief that Governments should serve the individual and not the other way around is shaped by America\u2019s story. Our nation began with the promise of freedom that applied only to the few, but because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize and march and protest. And ultimately those ideals won out and opened doors for women, minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength. It gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavour. It made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States.\nSo, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that has taken place in countries as different as Japan, Chile, Indonesia and Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for the people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal and democratic and open than their own.\nSo those of us who believe in democracy need to speak out forcefully because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That does not mean that democracies are not without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens, not less. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics, too much entrenched partisanship, too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.\nIn Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push-and-pull of national politics. Too often in capitals decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. So these are real problems. As leaders of democratic Governments make the case for democracy abroad, we had better strive harder to set a better example at home.\nMoreover, every country will organize its Government informed by centuries of history, the circumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize that a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what at the time was a radical idea, the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia or Africa or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. If anyone doubts the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom and dignity and the opportunity to control their own lives.\nThis leads me to the third thing we need to do. We must reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead, we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect for all human beings. It is a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, migration, the Internet \u2014 all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Mohammed.\nIn a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, we see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries. There is no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions, from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group.\nIf our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race, tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small. We are too packed together for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.\nWe see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. So much of the collapse in order there has been fuelled because leaders sought legitimacy, not because of policies or programmes, but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for years. They are now at work helping to fuel both Syria\u2019s tragic civil war and the mindless medieval menace of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The mindset of sectarianism, extremism, blood-letting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. If we are honest, we will understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. Our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy. And there is a military component to that, which means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there is no ultimate military victory to be won, we are going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.\nAcross the region\u2019s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder, because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer \u2014 most of all in that region \u2014 and extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.\nAnd what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely religious traditions can be honoured and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities \u2014 whether it is a religious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority in Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, and Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others.\nAnd this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I have noticed as President that, at times, both America\u2019s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington, and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.\nBut I believe that America has been a rare super- Power in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest, that while we have made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years \u2013 and I have acknowledged some \u2013 we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.\nWe have secured allies. We have acted to protect the vulnerable. We have supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We have bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we have made mistakes, we have tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty, hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders.\nI am proud of that. But I also know that we cannot do this alone. And I believe that if we are to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear programme, that enhances global security and enhances Iran\u2019s ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms, like the commitment to never test them again.\nWe cannot combat a disease like zika that recognizes no borders \u2013 mosquitos do not respect walls \u2013 unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola \u2013 by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures, rolling back the root causes of disease and helping poorer countries develop their public health infrastructures.\nWe can only eliminate extreme poverty if the Sustainable Development Goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children \u2013 including our girls \u2013 the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution\u2019s founding \u2013 to replace the ravages of war with cooperation \u2013 if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action \u2013 not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term \u2013 enhances our security. And I think that is not true just for us.\nIf Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbours, it may be popular at home and it may fuel nationalist fervour for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.\nWe are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we have accomplished at the United Nations over the past few years. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for United Nations peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.\nWe should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I will be discussing that more this afternoon, but we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard, because, in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations that are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.\nThere are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations \u2014 particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography \u2014 that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home.\nLet me conclude by saying that I recognize that history tells a different story than the one that I have talked about here today. There is a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes, ethnic groups and nation States have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.\nTime and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to then repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that is our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war, but we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created the United Nations so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders and each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best, for we have shown that we can choose a better history.\nSitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote:\n\u201cHuman progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.\u201d\nAnd during the course of these eight years, as I have travelled to many nations represented here, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, more inclusive, more diverse and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations. And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth, but it also comes with young people\u2019s access to information about other peoples and places \u2014 an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.\nI think of the thousands of health-care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, or the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programmes online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans \u2014 entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens \u2014 who are remaking our nation once again, and who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be.\nMy own family is made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world \u2014 just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They do not have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.\nAnd the embrace of these principles as universal does not weaken my particular pride in or my particular love for America \u2014 it strengthens it. My belief that these ideals apply everywhere does not lessen my commitment to helping those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people and I can best look after my own daughters by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and other people\u2019s daughters and sons.\nThis is what I believe \u2014 that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our Governments, and the United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the duties of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish you every success in fulfilling your tasks. I also wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his efforts during his presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also wish to extend our profound thanks to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for the efforts he has undertaken to achieve United Nations goals during his tenure.\nThe international community is facing many challenges and unresolved regional and international crises that have become a hindrance to regional and international development and stability. Some countries continue to pursue an approach with actions that go beyond the framework of international legitimacy against the backdrop of international negligence in the implementation of Security Council resolutions. It is no longer possible to overlook the weakness of the United Nations legal and institutional system and its inability in many cases to apply standards of justice and fairness in the functioning of its mechanisms. There is a persistent recurring pattern that marks all these crises: the selectivity of the Security Council in addressing problems, especially when it comes to the use of force by countries in international relations.\nAfter more than seven decades of Israeli occupation of Arab territories, the Palestinian cause is at standstill, waiting for a just solution. The Government of Israel has not only rejected the resolutions of international legitimacy and the comprehensive Arab Peace Initiative, but it also seeks to impose a fait accompli through long-term plans to build settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. It has founded its occupation on discrimination and racial segregation. It has established two legal systems under its sovereignty \u2014 one for the occupiers and another for those languishing under occupation. Against the backdrop of the world\u2019s silence and the Arab States\u2019 involvement in their own current issues, Israel\u2019s leaders may believe that they have succeeded in their endeavour. However, they have utterly failed to resolve the issue. The Palestinian people are now more devoted to their rights than ever. Furthermore, the Arab peoples cannot accept any kind of normalization of relations with Israel as long as Israel proceeds with the occupation and its related practices and before a just solution to the Palestinian cause is achieved.\nBesides, what will Israel do with the millions of Palestinians who are living on their own land and are increasing in number and resourcefulness? The options are clearly narrowing. Israel has either to opt for the two-State solution or to establish a system of apartheid. Does Israel really think that it could maintain a system of apartheid in the twenty-first century? Eliminating the occupation has become an urgent political and security prerequisite and an international obligation towards a people whose land was occupied and homeland confiscated and whose suffering is exacerbating the situation.\nThe Security Council bears a special responsibility to impose international legitimacy and consensus with respect to the negotiations on the basis of a two-State solution, including the establishment of a Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the pre-1967 borders. Meanwhile, it is necessary to cease settlement activities, respect the legal status of Al-Quds, lift the unjust siege on the Gaza Strip and end the Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab territories, including the Syrian Golan.\nIn the past, from this very rostrum, we have warned that inaction in addressing crises will only increase their intensity and complexity and consequently pose a threat to international security. Today, more than five years after the outbreak of the Syrian crisis and in the aftermath of the destruction of most of Syria\u2019s cities by the Al-Assad regime, we are meeting again in this Hall. As a result of the crisis, the number of refugees has doubled and the quest for refuge has become transcontinental in scope. Syria is now importing terrorist and sectarian organizations and militias that pose a regional and international threat.\nEveryone knows that the Syrian revolution started as a popular and peaceful uprising against a repressive dictatorial regime and that the great people of Syria face death or years of torture in prison if they attend peaceful demonstrations against the regime. During this period, the Syrian authorities have deliberately tried to turn the revolution into a violent one. It has also acted under the guise of political rhetoric to split the Syrian people into factions, but the people have responded with the chant, \u201cthe Syrian people are one\u201d. In contrast, the regime\u2019s declared slogan was \u201cAl-Assad alone, or we will burn the country down\u201d. Many people may not have realized that this slogan is the de facto project of the regime and remains its only programme.\nTheoretically, the majority of the countries of the world have stood by the Syrian people, but in practical terms, Syria has been abandoned, supported only by some loyal friends. Red lines had been set for the regime, but it violated them, and those who set the red lines did nothing. The red lines continued to shift until the regime became aware that there were no limits on what it could do without accountability.\nIt is true that violent radical forces that have nothing to do with the objectives of the Syrian revolution have entered the Syrian arena, refuse to take up revolution\u2019s banner and fight against the rebels more than against the regime. There have been many violations, but these phenomena, which have marred the revolution, cannot be understood without also considering the barbaric policy of repression applied by the Syrian regime and the inability of the international community to protect civilians against the use of chemical weapons, bomb barrels and torture.\nThe city of Daraa presented a model of peaceful revolution, exemplified at the beginning by the tossing of flowers at soldiers, but after massacres claiming the lives of hundreds of innocent people, mostly women and children, the city was forced, like other cities, to defend itself more forcefully. Since then, Daraa has been reeling under non-stop shelling and a starvation siege, despite the fact that it was never controlled by any radical or takfiri organization, and its revolutionaries have not committed any violations.\nWhy then are the inhabitants of Daraa being displaced while the international community does nothing? Why was no warning issued before the regime began its shelling and depopulation efforts, when warnings have been issued elsewhere, for example, prior to the recent bombing against forces in Al-Hasakah province? We consider the latter warning to have been an appropriate one, but no analogous action was taken with respect to Daraa, Muadamiyat Al-Sham, Madaya, Al-Zabadani or other towns also threatened with displacement. Many Syrian citizens are wondering the same thing.\nWe cannot fool ourselves or our people because it is unacceptable that the will of the international community is crippled when it comes to the perpetrators of crimes against humanity. It is simply not true that it was impossible to protect the Syrian people. The international community has allowed illegal military interventions to be undertaken to overthrow regimes in our region, which is still taking its toll on us. Unfortunately, while many of us share responsibility for that situation, the international community has not stepped in to protect a defenceless people, despite the fact that this people has proved time and again that it could change the regime on its own if they were protected by the international community from bombardment.\nPutting an end to this humanitarian disaster has become a political and moral necessity. The Security Council has a historical and undeniable responsibility to stop the bloodshed of the Syrians by halting the barbaric bombings and blockades of cities, by repatriating the displaced and by taking measures to resume the political process within the framework of resolution 2254 (2015) and decisions based on the first Geneva Convention, which call for the formation of a transitional ruling body with full powers to meet the aspirations of the Syrian people and maintain the unity and sovereignty of Syria, on the basis of equal rights for all citizens of Syria, without discrimination on the basis of faith, creed, ethnicity or race.\nThe Gulf region has strategic importance at both regional and global levels. This region is undergoing several crises that vary widely in character but are similar at the core. Constructive dialogue must be undertaken if solutions to them are to be found. To achieve the desired result, dialogue between countries must be based on the principles of good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and non-interference in the affairs of others. The success of dialogue among parties within a State, as we have seen in Iraq, requires giving priority to political and social consensus and strengthening the concept of full and equal citizenship before the law, leaving aside all forms of sectarianism.\nWith respect to Yemen, the State of Qatar renews its support for the return of legitimacy as the only way to ensure its security, unity and stability. There is no doubt that the negligence of the international community in implementing resolutions of the Security Council, especially resolution 2216 (2015), has given some political forces in Yemen the opportunity to carry out coup-related actions that have hampered reaching the desired political solution that would satisfy the Yemeni people\u2019s yearning for unity and stability.\nI take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of my brother, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, who has sponsored the Yemeni negotiations hosted by his country. We will continue to support the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy for Yemen as well as the international efforts undertaken to resume political consultations among Yemeni parties in order to reach a political settlement, in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and resolution 2216 (2015).\nAlthough the situation in Libya is still turbulent, we look forward to restoring stability through the efforts of the Presidential Council and the present Government backed by the international community. We also look forward to confronting terrorism and tackling its serious effects. The State of Qatar has contributed to the success of the international political solution. We reaffirm our support for all efforts aimed at strengthening the Libyan national accord and warn that instability could deal a glancing blow to what has been achieved heretofore and undermine United Nations efforts aimed at promoting national reconciliation and led by the Security Council.\nWe are surprised to note that some countries support forces in Libya that have rejected the international solution and are acting to thwart resolution 1970 (2011) by force, despite the fact that the resolution provides for imposing sanctions on such forces. Certain forces have placed themselves under the authority of the Presidential Council and are engaged in combating terrorism, but others have rejected the international solution and sought to exploit the volatile situation by occupying oil-export terminals while the world looks on, silent. Is this a proper way to encourage Libyans to fight terrorism?\nThe terrorism we are facing is a threat to our peoples, countries and economic and social achievements, thereby requiring that we intensify our efforts to combat it. All of us are mindful that success in countering this dangerous phenomenon is not easily reached, but it is not impossible either, especially when there is the political will to address the social roots of this abhorrent phenomenon. We need to understand the circumstances that, in an atmosphere of desperation and deadlocked perspectives, give rise to radical ideologies.\nWe need to protect the young people who are targeted by extremist groups. Fighting terrorism is not confined to the security dimension; rather, we need to go a step further and promote the values of tolerance, culture, plurality and dialogue, while taking into account the right of people to resist occupation, which is a right that has been enshrined in international laws, covenants and norms.\nTo restore our credibility, we must carefully define terrorism and diligently stand against it, if we are to educate our young people and mobilize our communities against this scourge. The definition we choose should not vary according to the identity of the perpetrator or the victim or because of a particular political interest. We have seen cases, for example, where a certain organization, misbranded as terrorist when it was simply a political adversary, was later embraced as a friend when it became a temporary ally.\nDistinctions should not be made about the lives of civilians, whether they be from Istanbul, Gaza, New York or Aleppo. No life is more important or valuable than any other life. The double standards used to address this phenomenon, by linking terrorism to a certain faith or culture or by absolving Governments that engage in it from being described as terrorist, complicates efforts to uproot the phenomenon and reinforces pretexts being used by terrorists to justify their actions. In this context, and as a natural consequence of our policy of rejecting radicalism and terrorism based on our values and culture and the teachings of the true Islamic religion, we reiterate our support for the efforts to eradicate the phenomenon of terrorism that are undertaken within the framework of international legitimacy.\nRespect for and the protection and promotion of human rights constitute one of the basic pillars of the United Nations Charter\u2019s stated purposes and principles and are consistent with the Arab and Islamic principles and values that treasure humankind and honour it as a creation of almighty God. The State of Qatar is eager to implement its obligations at both the national and international levels to defend collective and individual rights of people and promote human rights around the world.\nAccordingly, one of the most important challenges we must act upon today is that of protecting refugees. This challenge requires cooperation and joint action in order to uproot the causes of forced displacement. We must urgently provide aid and assistance as a humanitarian duty incumbent upon us all. Qatar\u2019s development and relief contribution has reached more than 100 countries worldwide, and we continue to coordinate with Governmental and non-governmental agencies to provide even more development and relief aid.\nQatar supports over 10 million children around the world and promotes the potential of some 1.2 million Arab young people, so as to empower them to be active and productive in their communities. Over the past five years since 2011, the value of the economic assistance provided by the State of Qatar has increased threefold to reach 13 billion Qatari riyals.\nThe State of Qatar will continue to be a venue for dialogue and conflict resolution by peaceful means. It will also remain committed to international action, cooperation and partnership within the framework of the efforts of the international community to counter shared humanitarian challenges.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey the warm greetings of \u201cYokwe\u201d on behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nEvery year, world leaders gather at the United Nations to strengthen that which binds us all: that despite our vast differences, the fact is that we get more done when we work together and when we cooperate. As leaders, we know and accept that our efforts to improve the well-being of our peoples cannot, in the end, be at the expense of others, and we simply cannot leave any one behind.\nTo us as a low-lying island nation, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change demonstrates that international spirit of cooperation and interdependency. I used to be a teacher, so I implore those Member States that have not ratified the Paris Agreement to do their next homework from this week. It is imperative that the Paris Agreement enter into force this year. I know that the Agreement is not perfect. We need to do more to increase our commitments on mitigation, on adaptation and on finance. We must take every opportunity to remain below the 1.5\u00b0C limit needed for our survival.\nI congratulate Mr. Thomson on his election as the first President of the General Assembly from a Pacific island country.\nI am addressing the Assembly today as the first female leader of an independent Pacific island nation. In the Pacific, women and mothers are often at the heart of our communities, and they ensure resilience. If women do not plan for the long-term, families and communities will not thrive. It follows that, if Pacific island nations fail to plan, the rest of the world will suffer the loss of our vast fisheries and oceans. If world leaders act only for short-term gain, we will rob our youngest and future generations of their rightful inheritance.\nI have travelled to the United Nations to share our Marshallese story of how we, a small island nation and a large-ocean State, are defining our future on our own terms. As a former United Nations Trust Territory, whose well-being was once entrusted to this very Organization, it is important that we not take this journey alone, but with the firm partnership of the international community.\nFirst, our broad progress must be built on education in order to ensure that our young people have the tools to lead our future. We must, therefore, achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4, on quality education. As an educator, I know how important it is that we turn around low indicators and provide an adequate education to all, not only by continuing to improve our teacher qualifications, but by designing a curriculum that also emphasizes our Marshallese language and ways of being. We must define ourselves in our own words and through our own customs. I am proud to announce a new research partnership with Columbia University Teachers College that will not only assist us with bilingual education, but also inspire us to serve as a model for others around the world.\nSecondly, our future must be underpinned by our economic security and progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 1, to end poverty, Goal 8, on economic growth and Goal 10, to reduce inequality. For too long, we have been largely reliant on the assistance of others. While that has provided an important backstop for basic social development, it has also undermined our self-reliance. We face serious challenges as a small island State, but we also have unexplored potential for growth.\nWe must move towards a serious expansion of the private sector so as to create jobs and strengthen our national benefit from our sustainable resources, especially our fisheries, our role as a port State, tourism and copra exports. As we consider all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 as we think all the way out to 2030 and consider the mid-points, including 2023 \u2014 we must not only have an ambitious policy, but also define the solid financial pathway needed to get there.\nRight now, our short-term economic risk up to and beyond 2023 is simply unacceptable, as we transition to a new trust fund. Recently, much has been said at the United Nations about innovative finance and building development and resiliency through private investment. Instead of doubting how that applies to my nation, I issue a stark challenge to ourselves and our partners to work closely with us in order to chart our new economic future to 2023 and beyond, with creative solutions to difficult problems. If we are truly serious about tackling the SDGs, let us truly find solutions for island-tailored innovative finance.\nThirdly, our national growth and well-being must be driven by a commitment to improve delivery on basic social development \u2014 health, food security and the environment. In particular, the most vulnerable groups in our islands, especially the elderly, the disabled and single parents, should be targeted. The Marshall Islands has the highest rate of diabetes incidence in the world. It is a national crisis, and our consumption of sugary food and beverages is literally killing us. Our environment is challenged by the overwhelming amount of plastic, metal cans and trappings of the modern Western world. And, as if our local communities do not have enough challenges, our vulnerability to natural hazards and climate-driven events like droughts and coastal flooding will be far worse in the future, even with strong efforts to curb global emissions under the Paris Agreement.\nEven with the issue of our very survival on the line, we are committed to addressing those challenges with immediate action, working on SDG Goal 7, on affordable energy, Goal 3, on good health, Goal 6, on clean water and Goal 11, on sustainable communities. In order to counter diabetes, our Parliament is considering a sharp increase of import taxes on sugar-added beverages. We are taking forward and implementing, with international support, a disaster-risk-reduction plan and measures. Our Parliament is considering a national ban on plastic bags and the introduction of recycling in order to clean up our local communities and provide a modest income stream along the way. We are tasking our environment agency with addressing water quality and water security. We are moving on practical measures to reduce our costly reliance on oil through sustainable transport and more efficient and renewable energy forms. We cannot \u2014 and will not \u2014 ignore our pressing future risks.\nAs in many parts of the world, sadly, domestic violence is a serious issue in the Pacific. SDG 5 commits States to ending worldwide domestic violence against women and girls, and my Government is moving forward with a commitment to building safe houses \u2014 the first one to be known as Weto In Mour \u2014 for abused women. It may be that the Pacific and the world must adjust to a new era, when the voices of women and girls gain their rightful place in communities and homes and at all levels of politics, from local politics to the United Nations.\nOur Pacific Ocean defines us and underpins SDG 14, on oceans. If we fail to conserve and realize a more equitable return from our rich fisheries, not only will our future be threatened, but global food security could be undermined. We are committed to the protection and sustainable use of our fisheries and ocean resources, but our good intentions are not enough. It is well past time that distant fishing nations and the global super- Powers who dominate our fisheries look beyond their plenary statements and into the real-world impact of many of their negotiating positions.\nMarshallese have been coming to the United Nations for nearly 65 years to focus greater attention on the harm caused by nuclear-weapons testing, with a legacy and burden shared by few others. And we remain the only instance in which the United Nations ever authorized the specific use of nuclear-weapons testing, in Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV) and 1493 (XVII), a fact which the United Nations has never acknowledged. Not many people in the world know of our own bitter experiences with nuclear detonation and what those weapons did to my country and the Marshallese people.\nMost of us think of nuclear weapons only as weapons of mass destruction; they conjure up wartime images of levelled buildings and the incineration of all living things. But how many people in the world have truly experienced what we have \u2014 physical, mental, environmental and cultural burdens that last for generations, and the displacement of our people from their ancestral islands? Those are not mere historical events. As a Special Rapporteur affirmed in 2012, they are fundamental human rights issues and the international community \u201chas an ongoing obligation to encourage a final and just resolution\u201d (A/HRC/21/48/ Add.1, para 66(a)).\nWords without action are of no benefit to our people. I am committing my Administration to renewing the focus on nuclear-impact issues. And I feel that I have every right not only to ask but to demand the full assistance of the international community and the United Nations system and tangible results from them. In the light of our experience, it is our fervent hope that such weapons of mass destruction will never again be tested or unleashed and that all nuclear-armed nations will have the necessary political will and empathy to disarm,\nI appeal to the Government of the Democratic Republic of North Korea to halt any further nuclear- weapons tests and to achieve full nuclear disarmament.\nFinally, my Government will follow through on our commitment to the Human Rights Council with respect to achieving SDG 16 for justice. We will advance core human rights treaties for ratification at the next session of our Parliament. Many such treaties are already reflected in our Constitution and affirm basic freedoms enjoyed worldwide. Those basic rights, our national plan, the Sustainable Development Goals and the identification of major national challenges and priority reforms included in my Administration\u2019s Agenda 2020: A Framework for Progress for the Republic of the Marshall Islands must all be addressed in a comprehensive effort.\nI have spent most of my speech today urging that no one be left behind and demonstrating our goodwill to play our part. I must also emphasize that the role of Taiwan as a key stakeholder and its determination to contribute to global affairs should be better recognized. I call on the international community to support Taiwan\u2019s efforts as an advocate for regional and global stability, peace and dialogue, including in cross- Strait relations. The United Nations should be more committed to ensuring Taiwan\u2019s fundamental right to participate in mechanisms, meetings and activities of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system, and Taiwan should be recognized for its strong contribution in working with us and others towards achieving the SDGs.\nGiven the importance of human rights to my country, I request that the Human Rights Council initiate a credible and independent investigation of alleged human rights violations in West Papua.\nLet me close by saying that we must turn words into reality and move forward with a renewed and sharper focus on long-held priorities. This is a commitment of my Government, and I urgently call for international partnership.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to be present at the General Assembly today. It is wonderful to be here in the great city of New York. Once again this week, New Yorkers showed us how to be resilient and resolute in the face of violent extremism. On behalf of everyone in this Hall, let me directly say to the people of New York that they are a model to the rest of the world, and we thank them.\nExactly one year ago, Canada was in the middle of a long \u2014 78 days on the road, and I can assure the Assembly that, in Canada, there are 78 days\u2019 worth of roads \u2014 and closely fought election campaign. It is the responsibility of a leader to spend time with the people they are elected to serve. To get the real stories, it is important to go where people live: coffee shops and church basements, mosques and synagogues, farmers\u2019 markets and public parks. It was in those places that I got the best sense of what Canadians were thinking and how they were doing and, through the politeness \u2014 because we Canadians are always polite even when we are complaining \u2014 I learned a few things.\nI talked with people my age who were trying to be hopeful about their future but found it tough to make ends meet, even when they were working full-time. I heard from young Canadians who were frustrated, who told me that they could not get a job because they do not have work experience but they cannot get work experience because they do not have a job. I heard from women and girls who still face inequality in the workplace and violence just because they are women, even in a progressive country like Canada.\nI met parents who were working hard to give their children every opportunity to succeed but who feared that their efforts would not be sufficient. I had the chance share a meal with elderly retirees who had toiled all their lives but who now have to go to food banks. Over the past few years, I have had far too many disturbing conversations with Canadians, but they made something clear to me. Canadians still believe in progress, or, at least, that progress is possible. But that optimism is mixed with great concern. It is clear that Canadians are not the only ones who feel that way; those feelings are present everywhere. That anxiety is a fact of life.\nWhen leaders are faced with citizens\u2019 anxiety, we have a choice to make. Do we exploit that anxiety or do we allay it? Exploiting it is easy, but in order to allay it we need to be prepared to answer some very direct questions. What will create the good, well-paying jobs that people want and need and deserve? What will strengthen and grow the middle class and help those working hard to join it? What will build an economy that works for everyone? What will help to make the world a safer, more peaceful place?\nTo allay people\u2019s anxiety, we need to create economic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair and successful world is a peaceful one. We need to focus on what brings us together, not on what divides us. For Canada, that means re-engaging in global affairs through institutions like the United Nations. It does not serve our interests \u2014 or the world\u2019s \u2014 to pretend that we are not deeply affected by what happens beyond our borders.\nEarlier this year, we helped negotiate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As part of our commitment to implementing that Agreement, we announced that Canada would invest $2.65 billion over five years to fund clean, low-carbon growth in developing countries. In order to help promote peace and security in areas affected by instability, we reaffirmed our support for NATO and committed ourselves to expanding Canada\u2019s role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We hosted the fifth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, where we increased our contribution by 20 per cent by giving more than $800 million to the Global Fund. We also encouraged our partners to increase their contributions, making it possible to raise $13 billion in support of ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by 2030.\nWe have done all this \u2014 and will do much more \u2014 because we believe we should confront anxiety with a clear plan to deal with its root causes. We believe we should bring people together around shared purposes such as the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. What is the alternative? Is it to exploit anxiety? Is it to turn it into fear and blame? Is it to reject others because they look or speak or pray differently than we do?\nIn Canada we got a very important thing right \u2014 not perfect, but right. In Canada, we see diversity as a source of strength, not weakness. Our country is strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them. We must make no mistake: we have had many failures, from the internment of Ukrainian, Japanese and Italian Canadians during the World Wars, to our turning away of boats of Jewish and Punjabi refugees, to the shamefully continuing marginalization of indigenous peoples. What matters is that we learn from our mistakes and recommit ourselves to doing better. To that end, in recent months, Canadians have opened their hearts and their arms to families fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria, and from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 refugees were welcomed \u2014 not as burdens, but as neighbours and friends \u2014 as new Canadians.\nThat effort has brought Canadians together. In an almost unprecedented fashion, the Government has worked with the business community, engaged citizens and civil society to help the newcomers adapt to their new country. But our efforts will not truly be successful until those refugees have become established, full- fledged members of the Canadian middle class. I want the General Assembly to know that this objective is within our grasp \u2014 not because of what we have done, but because of what they are themselves.\nRefugees are people with the same hopes and dreams as our own citizens. But while our people have felt anxiety, Syrians faced catastrophe. We all know where Syria\u2019s middle class is: they are living in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They are moving across Europe, looking for a place to set down roots, to get their kids back into school, to find steady work and to become productive citizens. Refugee camps are teeming with Syria\u2019s middle class: doctors and lawyers, teachers and entrepreneurs. They are well educated. They work hard. They care about their families. They want a better life \u2014 a safer and more secure future for their kids \u2014 as we all do. When I say, therefore, that I hope that the Syrian refugees we welcomed will soon be able to join our middle class, I am confident that we can make that happen, and we will do it by offering to them the same things we offer to all our citizens \u2014 a real and fair chance at success for everyone.\nWe are going to do all we can to build a strong middle class in Canada. We are going to invest in education, because it gives the next generation the tools they need to contribute to the world economy and to succeed. We are going to invest in infrastructure because it creates good, well-paying jobs for the middle class and helps to make our communities better places to live, work and invest. We are determined to build an economy that works for everyone \u2014 not just the wealthiest 1 per cent \u2014 so that every person benefits from economic growth. And we are going to refuse to give in to the pressure of trading our cherished values for easy votes. The world expects better from us, and we expect better from ourselves.\nIn the end, there is a choice to be made. Strong, diverse, resilient countries like Canada did not happen by accident, and they will not continue without effort. Every single day, we need to choose hope over fear and diversity over division. Fear has never created a single job or fed a single family, and those who exploit it will never solve the problems that have created such anxiety. Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people we collectively serve, are better than the cynics and pessimists think they are. People want their problems solved, not exploited.\nCanada is a modest country. We know we cannot solve these problems alone. We know we need to do this all together. We know it will be hard work. But we are Canadian, and we are here to help.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure to express to the President and his friendly country our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish him every success in leading the work at this session and in bringing about tangible results with regard to all the issues on our agenda.\nI also want to take this opportunity to express to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, our sincere gratitude for the excellent manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. I wish to express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts to realize the objectives of the United Nations.\nThis session of the General Assembly coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of the Kingdom\u2019s membership in the United Nations. Over the past 60 years, Morocco has worked tirelessly with the international Organization. It is committed to its objectives of strengthening international peace and security and to delivering the possibility of development to all peoples of the world, especially in developing countries.\nJoining the Organization was one of the first sovereign decisions that Morocco took after it gained its independence. It is an expression of its commitment to multilateral action as the best way to confront complicated crises and the increasing challenges throughout the world, as well as its commitment to the values of solidarity, cooperation, freedom and peace. The Kingdom of Morocco believes in the role of the United Nations as a reflection of the world\u2019s values and the principles of international legitimacy.\nEver since it joined the Organization, Morocco has worked diligently to contribute to the realization of its objectives. In that respect, Morocco sought to adopt a dynamic approach by realigning its national priorities with those of the United Nations.\nPeacemaking is a cornerstone of the activities of the United Nations, as reflected in its history of peaceful settlement of international and regional conflicts and in its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and territorial unity of States, in accordance with the principles of the Organization. As a committed partner in United Nations peacekeeping operations since the 1960s, the Kingdom of Morocco has sought to contribute substantially and continuously as a demonstration of its belief in collective security and the crucial role that the United Nations plays in that regard. Morocco has participated in peacekeeping operations in Africa, America and Asia and has contributed more than 100,000 peacekeepers. Today, it is contributing more than 1,600 Blue Helmets to peacekeeping operations in Africa.\nIt is incumbent on the international community to work for international peace and security, especially in Africa, given the connection between economic and social progress and political stability. There can be no development without peace and security and no stability without comprehensive, sustainable development. Under the wise leadership of his Majesty King Mohammed VI, the Kingdom of Morocco will spare no effort to strengthen United Nations initiatives to promote good governance and contain conflicts related to the territorial integrity of countries. To that end, since January 2014 Morocco has chaired the Central African Republic configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission.\nEver since it became a Member of the United Nations, the Kingdom of Morocco has sought to establish relations of solidarity among members of the international community both by encouraging the constructive North-South partnership and by strengthening South-South cooperation. These are strategic priorities designed to realize sustainable development for the benefit of all peoples of the world. To put the issue of sustainable development at the centre of the work of the international community, the Kingdom seeks to develop genuine partnerships in order to bring about sustainable human development through solidarity.\nIn that connection, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the General Assembly in September 2015 (resolution 70/1), is a political commitment through which we have agreed on common ground in our efforts to fulfil the aspirations of people in developing nations to live in dignity. The Kingdom of Morocco emphasizes the importance of providing financing for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. All should do their part to implement the Agenda in an effective and appropriate manner.\nThe United Nations must align its work with the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while Member States must adopt the necessary measures and policies to implement the Goals, and various forms of financing should be provided to ensure that the Goals are achieved by 2030.\nAs part of the effort to strengthen development at the national level, the National Initiative for Human Development, which was launched by His Majesty King Mohammed VI in May 2005, is one of the basic pillars of Morocco\u2019s programme. It is human-centred and takes a comprehensive approach to development in that it includes political, economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It has been successful in reducing poverty, vulnerability and marginalization, in developing infrastructure, and in providing health- care services.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has strengthened its solidarity with African countries as a centrepiece of its foreign policy. It has sought to defend the interests of the continent and to help it to promote development and combat poverty. It has shared with a number of African countries its experience in the field of social services, including in the areas of education, training, water, agriculture, food security, electricity and health care. In this respect, the Kingdom of Morocco renews its call on the United Nations and regional and international financial institutions to develop a plan for economic transformation in Africa and to provide resources to finance it.\nGiven the link between sustainable development and the environment, Morocco, which will host the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Marrakesh in November, aspires to make the session an opportunity for African voices and those of other parts of the world that are vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change to be heard on an equal basis. It emphasizes its intention to make the Marrakesh session a turning point in the implementation of the Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by facilitating solutions for sustainable development, as well as practical measures and structural programmes to implement the global commitments to address climate change.\nMorocco wishes to emphasize that the success of the implementation of the Paris Agreement is organically and strongly linked to the provision of the necessary financial resources. We must promote access to financing. In that connection, the Kingdom of Morocco hopes that the Conference participants in Marrakesh will give special attention to the interests of the countries of the South, including African countries and small island developing States, that are threatened by climate change.\nAt this time, Morocco, which has deposited its instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement, calls on all other States to expedite their ratification of the Agreement so that it can enter into force as a strong expression of the commitment of the international community. Morocco seeks to include all stakeholders in the Marrakesh session so that it will reflect our solidarity and commitment to safeguarding the future of present and future generations.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has placed the continent of Africa at the heart of its foreign policy and will continue to make every effort to promote Africa\u2019s economic development. With a clear vision of the future based on an understanding of the continent\u2019s problems, His Majesty King Mohammed VI is leading the process of peace and development on the continent and launching initiatives and visiting several African countries in order to strengthen the ties of fraternity, cooperation and solidarity among the African people. During his most recent speech, on 20 August, His Majesty stressed the strong link between Morocco and Africa.He said:,\n\u201cAfrica, for us, is not a target. It is a commitment, because African people are Africans regardless of where they are and because the interests of Morocco are part of those of Africa. Our destinies will always be intertwined. In our view, we will either achieve progress and stability together or not at all. Africa is more than a geographical or historical connection. It is a commitment based on love and respect, human relations and a deep- seated interest.\u201d\nMorocco\u2019s decision to return to its natural place within the African Union is a firm expression of its commitment to Africa and reflects its interests. On this occasion, I wish to express our deep gratitude to the majority of African countries for calling on Morocco to return to its African context. Aware of its leading role in Africa, Morocco has responded to their call and will continue defending African interests at all levels.\nSixty years after joining our strong Organization, I underscore our belief in the role of regional economic groups. Morocco has sought to strengthen good- neighbourly relations in the African, Maghreb and Mediterranean contexts. His Majesty continues to call for a new regime in the Maghreb with influence at the regional and international levels, a regime that will guarantee peace and stability in the region, based on respect for member States and their territorial integrity.\nMorocco gave earnest and responsible thought to the Security Council\u2019s calls for a lasting political solution through negotiation in the regional conflict over Western Sahara and responded by putting forward a self-rule initiative that reflected several Security Council resolutions as the basis for a solution. The Council\u2019s most recent resolution on the issue, resolution 2285 (2016), emphasizes once again the basic aspects of a political solution to this conflict, calls on all parties to be realistic and seek consensus, and appeals to all parties and neighbouring States to seek a political solution through dialogue.\nMorocco reaffirms its intention to continue working sincerely with the United Nations to find a political solution through negotiations that will maintain the unity of the Kingdom of Morocco, enable the people of its southern region to manage their affairs in the context of democracy, stability and comprehensive development, and protect the northern part of the continent from the dangers of separatism, Balkanization, terrorism and extremism.\nThe sixtieth anniversary of Morocco\u2019s joining the United Nations is a good occasion to reaffirm Morocco\u2019s unwavering commitment to protecting human rights and defending fundamental freedoms as part of its efforts to uphold human dignity within a united and democratic community. Morocco has initiated many reforms and has realized many achievements designed to strength human rights, especially in relation to women, children and young people. It has expanded individual freedoms through an approach that puts human rights at the centre of human development. Morocco is working assiduously to integrate its comprehensive vision in all international forums and is playing a leading role in developing the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, including the universal periodic review, which Morocco was instrumental in developing.\nThe Kingdom has taken several initiatives with its partners in the Council to strengthen the United Nations human rights system. It also hosted the second World Human Rights Forum, in 2014, thereby adding an international dimension to the Kingdom\u2019s achievements. Morocco will spare no effort to make the noble principles of human rights a means to create friendship among nations and respect for the international community\u2019s diversity and to strengthen the essential values of human rights free from politicization.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, as an active Member of the United Nations, has adopted a clear and firm position with regard to international efforts to combat international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The Kingdom has endeavoured earnestly, through bilateral and multilateral cooperation efforts at the regional and international levels, to combat the phenomenon of terrorism. It reaffirms its commitment to scrupulously respecting its obligation to ensure that no terrorist activity is launched from Moroccan territory.\nLast April, Morocco was among the first countries to submit a national report on the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 2253 (2015) with regard to combating terrorism and suppressing its sources of financing. The report was very comprehensive and addressed in detail all the measures that Morocco has taken to implement its obligations in accordance with the resolution\u2019s provisions. At the national level, Morocco has adopted a sound and clear-cut policy to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations through a comprehensive and multidisciplinary strategy, which is closely aligned with that of the United Nations. It is based on a religious, social, legal and security approach.\nIn that connection, Morocco has launched a number of initiatives, including a joint initiative with the Netherlands in the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, to combat foreign terrorist fighters. Morocco and the Netherlands, through their joint chairmanship, want to expand the Forum at the regional and international levels and to strengthen related efforts at the international level. Morocco has also established the Group of Friends Against Terrorism at the United Nations, the purpose of which is to coordinate and harmonize the various voluntary initiatives.\nAt the regional level, Morocco has drawn on its experience in undertaking religious efforts to combat terrorism at the service of fraternal and friendly countries that wish to provide religious training to their imams to promote respect for the principles of peaceful coexistence and tolerance. In a letter addressing the growing ignorance of many about religion, His Majesty said that all people \u2014 Muslims, Christians and Jews \u2014 should stand as one in facing all forms of terrorism, extremism and hatred. The history of humankind shows that progress cannot be achieved in a society that is suffering from xenophobia and extremism, because those factors lead to a lack of security and stability.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco firmly believes that the United Nations must be the lead Organization in the fight against terrorism. It emphasizes its readiness to share its experiences and good practices with its partners. Morocco is open to considering any initiative that seeks to combat this phenomenon, bearing in mind that suppressing terrorism is a joint responsibility shared by all Member States of the United Nations. A global commitment and the adoption of a cooperative approach based on bilateral and regional solidarity are needed to implement the provisions of counter- terrorism agreements.\nWith the same commitment, Morocco pursues its efforts in the field of mediation for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Accordingly, the Kingdom hosted a meeting of the Libyan parties, convened under the auspices of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, which culminated in the signing the Skhirat Political Agreement. The Kingdom, which supports the search for a political solution to the Libyan problem through negotiations, stresses that an end must be put to the bloodshed of innocents and that the unity of Libya must be maintained. We call here on all Libyan political stakeholders to pursue dialogue and to fully implement the Skhirat Agreement without excluding any party. That will enable the Libyan people to realize their aspirations to stability, national unity and sustainable development in an atmosphere of freedom, dignity and democracy, devoid of extremism and terrorism.\nMorocco will spare no effort in its efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Sahel and Sahara regions. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2012 and 2013, it played a role, through the Council, in developing the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel, which seeks to strengthen good governance, security and development in the region.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco considers the Palestinian issue to be a crucial problem in the Middle East and is convinced that this sensitive region cannot enjoy a just and lasting peace as long as the Palestinian people are not able to exercise their alienable right to establish an independent and viable State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Morocco expresses its concern over the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are not advancing as they should. It calls on the international community to work more effectively and tenaciously to create the necessary conditions for a resumption of direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel within a specific time frame. The revival of the peace process must be based on solid ground, in accordance with the principles of international legitimacy and previous agreements, such as the road map and the Arab Peace Initiative, in order to ensure the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco will remain committed to the peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question by supporting constructive initiatives that would ensure the necessary conditions to realize a two-State solution, including the French initiative, which involves comprehensive international and Egyptian efforts with a regional impact. Morocco calls on Palestine and Israel to resume negotiations.\nThe troubling developments affecting the Holy City of Jerusalem, including human rights violations, continued settlement and forced displacement in an effort to change the legal and demographic composition of the city, represent grave violations of international law and international agreements. There must be an immediate intervention to put an end to them. His Majesty the King, as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has called the attention of the international community to the dangers and threats of Israel\u2019s pursuit of its plans to change the legal, demographic and religious character of Jerusalem. He urges the leading Powers to ensure that Jerusalem remains a symbol of peaceful coexistence among all monotheistic religions.\nAfter 70 years of the existence of our international Organization, today more than ever we need a strong, renewed and effective United Nations. We must therefore reaffirm our commitment to the principles of the Organization and to mobilizing our capacities to reform and strengthen it. The Organization is the most effective multilateral forum for seeking solutions to contemporary problems and for bringing about a just international system that will ensure peace and stability for present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "I have real pleasure in extending, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Haiti and in my own name, warm congratulations to Ambassador Peter Thomson on his election as President of our Assembly. His proven experience in international issues and his outstanding personal qualities bode well for the success of the seventy-first session.\nI would also like to give a special greeting to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his outstanding performance at the head of our Organization, particularly his commitment to peace and the promotion of development in the world. Haiti\u2019s voice joins in the unanimous praise which crowns his second mandate in that office.\nSeventy-one years ago, the fifty original States Members of the United Nations took the solemn and decisive commitment to build a new world order based on fundamental human rights. Before a world emerging from the tragedies of a terrible war, they championed the equality of men\u2019s and women\u2019s rights, the inviolable principle of parity of the subjects of international law and the right of peoples to self-determination. In a praiseworthy endeavour to heal the wounds of recent conflicts, they advocated better living conditions for the people of the world under the aegis of freedom and democracy.\nFrom this rostrum, Haiti declares the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of our Organization to be more relevant in today\u2019s world than ever before. In the face of a succession of threats posed by the spectre of ecological peril, terrorist brutality and the persistence of various regional conflicts, we must reassert our faith in the purposes of our Organization. The values it embodies and the precepts it defends and promotes in the analysis and management of major contemporary issues and challenges are more pertinent than ever. Today it is more essential than ever that the United Nations fully assume its role in order to provide collective responses to all manner of crises threatening peace in the world. The encroachments of terrorism and the international problems of an economic, social and humanitarian nature are among the issues that the United Nations must address, in keeping with its original mission of human understanding and solidarity.\nThe Republic of Haiti is proud to have participated in the founding of the Organization. We strongly support the measures it undertakes to strengthen and broaden the scope of its actions. We also welcome the initiatives for necessary reform, particularly within the Security Council.\nHaiti stands alongside and encourages the United Nations in its intentions to strengthen its capabilities in the conduct of peacekeeping operations, the fight against pandemics and health crises and the promotion of democracy and human rights, without overlooking or neglecting economic, social and cultural rights.\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change perfectly illustrates the concept of a collective destiny for all peoples that lies at the heart of this Organization. This vision has inspired urgent and united international action in the face of an issue that threatens the very survival of our planet. The Agreement represents unquestionable success, and we sincerely hope that all established commitments and obligations are followed through.\nThe progress made over the past seven decades, whether in terms of human rights, peacekeeping or international development cooperation, is undeniable. This is in large part thanks to the powerful and generous vision that inspired the founders of our Organization, a vision that remains as potent as ever. While congratulations are in order for recent advances, some of which are truly remarkable, I would particularly like to acknowledge the peace agreement recently signed in Havana by the Government of our sister Republic of Colombia with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. We are forced to admit, however, that the obstacles hindering peace and sustainable development in the world remain numerous. Nevertheless, we welcome the recent rapprochement of the United States of America with Cuba, which is likely to further peace in our region.\nThe Republic of Haiti encourages the international community to pay further attention to the aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan to play a more active role in certain decisions and initiatives that could contribute to stability and reconciliation among peoples and nations.\nOur delegation is particularly sensitive to two of the issues being addressed at the current session. I refer to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to the issue of refugees, migrants and the forced displacement of people.\nThe next 15 years will provide a detailed demonstration of the actions and efforts of the peoples of the planet, resolutely engaged in a noble struggle to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be both our compass and our milestones throughout humankind\u2019s journey towards a world free of unacceptable deprivation, shortcomings and failures.\nThe Republic of Haiti chooses to be among the States on the front line as we head towards sustainable development. Having acknowledged what is at stake, my Government has courageously decided to lay the foundations for our dedicated participation in the global implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to put our country firmly on track towards inclusive and sustainable development.\nThrough the purposeful appropriation of the SDGs and their integration into Haiti\u2019s development policies and strategies, we are enabling the country to take concrete action that will help to improve the living conditions of every Haitian. In that context, I fully support the adoption in Hangzhou by the Group of 20 of an action plan aimed at facilitating the launch of a sustainable development programme for 2030 and supporting the industrialization efforts of African and least developed countries. We have great hopes for the coming years.\nWe also pay particular attention to the Goals\u2019 approach to the issue of migration. Migration flows have always been at the core of the dynamics among the world\u2019s peoples. However, we are all very concerned about recent large increases in the frequency and numbers of people fleeing conflict zones, including women and children, and the human tragedies that befall those sometimes desperate attempts. Needless to say, the Republic of Haiti can particularly relate to the issue, and we welcomed the high-level meeting on the subject held at the beginning of this session. We hope that concrete decisions, equal to the magnitude of the tragedies and risks faced by displaced populations, can be taken to protect them. We also urge that substantial support be provided to help host countries. We believe it is vital to take every possible step to combat the traffickers who abuse the good faith of those fleeing poverty and misery.\nThe Haitian delegation is well aware of the growing number of our compatriots who are leaving the country in search of a better life elsewhere. We understand and have taken on board the legitimate concerns that have been expressed by representatives of some countries of destination or transit, some of them from this very podium. This human tragedy calls for specific decisions and measures that can offer the Haitian people new opportunities and better living conditions. To that end, we need peace, political stability, development-oriented infrastructure, entities that will help to strengthen the rule of law and a better understanding of the major socioeconomic challenges that we face. We have launched a dialogue with various host countries with the aim of finding shared solutions.\nAt this point, I would like to briefly paint a picture of the current situation in Haiti. In about two weeks, the Haitian people will go to the polls. The mandate that the National Assembly conferred on me at my election was unequivocal: restore Haitians\u2019 confidence in the electoral process, reinstate constitutional order by completing the electoral cycle begun in 2015 and hold fair, credible, transparent and democratic presidential and legislative elections. That is the task I have been working on unceasingly for the past seven months. The inauguration of the new President of the Republic on 7 February 2017 will be the culmination of the process of renewing and strengthening Haiti\u2019s republican institutions. Make no mistake \u2014 without fair and credible elections, any hope of a peaceful political transition is a vain illusion. A smooth transition remains the prerequisite and foundation for political stability, consolidation of the rule of law, economic modernization and development.\nIt is crucial to ensure that the forthcoming elections are credible if we are to effectively break the cycle of instability and the political uncertainty that has dogged my country for too long. In upholding my commitment to the Haitian people, I have spared no effort to help to create the conditions and atmosphere that are essential to the proper conduct of the elections, and impartial observers have unanimously noted the progress we have made on restoring our institutions and constitutional order. Parliament is now up and running and will be fully functional after the elections. The elected mayors have gradually taken up their functions, and that process has gone sooothly..\nThe Government is deeply respectful of the independence and prerogatives of the Provisional Electoral Council in organizing the elections. In response to the people\u2019s expectations and following up on the recommendations of our Independent Electoral Evaluation and Verification Commission, the Council has made appropriate fixes to remedy the manifest deficiencies in the electoral machinery. These have been welcomed by every sector, including the candidates themselves and the national and international observers.\nVoter confidence in the integrity of the electoral process is a major factor in citizens\u2019 participation and the legitimacy of both the election results and those elected. So far, the new Provisional Electoral Council, which I established in broad consultation with the country\u2019s driving forces, has demonstrated its ability to conduct the electoral process successfully. Despite dealing with various technical and logistical obstacles in circumstances of financial penury, the Government has shown its willingness to take on the financial burden of the elections. I am pleased to say that the process is on the right track.\nWhile the elections are not an end in themselves, they represent a necessary transition. The legitimacy of the new Haitian authorities will depend on their success. The day after the elections, our country will need to feel a powerful wave of international solidarity. Our new leaders will need that solidarity in order to address our structural problems, to ensure that they do not end up undermining Haiti\u2019s efforts to emerge from underdevelopment and to enable them to tackle the colossal task of turning our economy around after decades of regression. They will need it in order to undertake the reforms that are essential to our economic and social modernization and in order to make the massive investment in our failing infrastructure and the training of the human resources that the country so desperately needs.\nOn behalf of the Haitian people, I take this opportunity to commend the immense efforts of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, whose mandate will soon be the subject of a Security Council resolution. The progress that has been made during the Mission\u2019s 12 years in Haiti may seem slow to many observers, but it is nonetheless real, especially in the areas of security, promotion of human rights and building the capacities of institutions that ensure the rule of law, particularly through the Mission\u2019s support to the Haitian national police and the judiciary.\nThis is also an opportunity for me to salute the great courage and leadership of the Secretary-General. At the end of his second term, I urge him to accept the idea that my country needs international understanding if it is to tackle the challenges of the lack of sanitation that continues to expose it to epidemic and endemic disease and illnesses from all sources. In recent years, my people have suffered tremendously from waves of infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, Zika, chikungunya and dengue, among others. To overcome these scourges, declaration of good intent, comforting though they are, are of no effect and cannot yield results. We require real and effective sanitary support with respect to drinking water and waste treatment.\nThe renewed outbreak of cholera in recent months is one of the most acute challenges facing Haiti. It is a clear illustration of the perceptible deterioration in the humanitarian situation, as the Secretary-General stressed in a recent report to the Security Council (S/2016/753). In this connection, the Government of the Republic of Haiti has noted and welcomed the statements of the Secretary-General on two situations that have been discomforting for the United Nations: the many cases of sexual abuse perpetrated by peacekeepers, and the introduction of cholera to Haiti.\nThe recognition by the United Nations of its moral responsibility in the latter instance opens the way for real discussions as to the need to definitively end this pandemic, which affects many of my fellow citizens. Here we trust that the urgent appeal of the Secretary- General for a substantially strengthened programme to combat cholera and to provide material assistance to victims and their families will be heeded and will fully meet the expectations of the people of Haiti.\nHaiti is once again at a crossroads. The immediate future of the country hangs on the success of the forthcoming elections, but so too does the road that the country will take in coming years. At this historic juncture, the people and the Government of Haiti attach the greatest importance to the solidarity of the international community and to the cooperation of the United Nations and its Member States to ensure the success of the forthcoming elections, which, we firmly believe, will mark a decisive stage in the lengthy process of consolidating democracy and bringing about the rule of law in our country.\nAs I conclude, I once again reaffirm that the people of my country have confidence in the United Nations and in the ideal of universal solidarity, of which the United Nations is the most lofty and constant embodiment. Through me, the people of Haiti reiterate once again their belief in our Organization\u2019s capacity to build peace in the world, increase cooperation among peoples and help deprived populations to take charge of their destiny in the context of a new international order that is more just, has a greater spirit of solidarity and is a harbinger of hope and opportunity for all, so that everyone can have the opportunity to enjoy its share of progress.\n"

        "file_text": "Two years ago, I addressed the General Assembly for the first time as King of Spain (see A/69/PV.6). I feel at present the same honour and the same responsibility as I did on that occasion, because the United Nations is the universal forum for peace and progress for humankind, the place where we must secure the future of our planet.\nThat is how the Spanish people understand the demands on us. Today, we cannot disappoint the billions of people who, like Spanish society, believe in the purposes, principles and values of the 1945 San Francisco Charter and of the 2015 Declaration on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations that Spain helped to promote in defence of what the United Nations represents. With that Declaration, we wanted to tell the world that the Charter was not simply a beacon that lit the dark times of the past, but that it also illuminates our present and our future. For it is the beacon to which the children in refugee camps direct their eyes, as do the mothers who protect their children while crossing the Mediterranean \u2014 a plight which deeply moves us. It is the hope for those who have lost loved ones owing to natural disasters or hunger, those who defend human rights and common human dignity, and those who are persecuted as victims of terrorism in all its despicable forms. It is also the inspiration for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to which we have all committed ourselves with a view to putting an end to hunger and extreme poverty and to designing a model for development that is sustainable in the course of a generation.\nFor Spain, the 2030 Agenda is a source of inspiration for our domestic and foreign actions. We must fight inequality and work towards an economic model that fosters shared prosperity and provides employment opportunities for young people and, in general, for all those who have suffered most from the impact of the crisis in recent years. No one should be left behind because of what we do or fail to do.\nIn order to advance the cause that concerns us all, combating the effects of climate change is critical. I am pleased to underline that, nearly a year ago in Paris, we were able to reach a crucial agreement in this matter. Our compliance is an unavoidable priority for us all, and one on which we will be called to account by present and future generations. The upcoming twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Morocco, will offer an excellent opportunity to further strengthen our commitment.\nFinally, the Charter today serves as a beacon for Colombia. The Spanish people welcome the peace agreement reached in that beloved country, which has the strong support of our Government on both the bilateral and the multilateral level. Our Congress of Deputies has unanimously supported it. Spain will stand beside the Colombian people so that they can achieve the fruits of peace for all Colombians, who will have the last word in the plebiscite scheduled for 2 October.\nThe European, Ibero-American and Mediterranean dimensions that constitute the identity of the Spanish people testify to our universal vocation. We are amon the countries that have had the greatest impact on history, and we are proud of our substantial contribution to the common heritage of humankind.\nThis year, we celebrate the 400th anniversary of the death of Cervantes, a universally acknowledged literary genius, who was able to convey his belief that portraying a noble and generous spirit is the best way to live in the world. For us, the children of Cervantes, knowing how to live means, above all else, knowing how to live with others. When we coexist in a democratic framework that safeguards our hard-won rights and freedoms, together with our respect for our diversity, that is when we give the best of ourselves and contribute in more and better ways to the peace, security and prosperity of the international community, as we will continue to do.\nAll advanced democracies, such as ours, go through difficult times at some point in their history. But they come through them thanks to the strength and unity of their societies, the robustness of their institutions and the effectiveness of their system of freedoms, and thanks to the firm belief that differences must be resolved in accordance with rules that have been laid down. In recent decades, the Spanish people have, with a constructive spirit, demonstrated that they have embraced the values of dialogue, commitment, sense of duty and solidarity. Those are the values that transform nations into models for freedom around the world and promote the progress and well-being of their citizens.\nSpaniards have always come through difficult times, even after being hit by a severe global economic crisis, during which our society showed an enormous capacity to overcome adversity. We must continue to drive and reinforce the recovery on a firm, broad- based foundation, as well as to safeguard and improve the welfare state and a model of genuinely sustainable growth, diversifying our foreign presence and, above all, giving special attention to those who have suffered most and who continue to suffer the repercussions of the recession.\nThe Kingdom of Spain\u2019s membership in the Security Council during the 2015-2016 biennium shows that our country is shouldering its responsibilities, meeting its commitments and participating constructively in the quest for solutions to the problems we face today, such as the large movements of people that are a shocking sign of our times and are being given special attention during a week of ministerial meetings. Spain is on the homestretch of its mandate in the Security Council and is working with determination, accountability and transparency, guided by the desire to make acceptable and effective commitments to prevent conflicts and resolve existing ones We have spearheaded efforts in the humanitarian field and are encouraging the increased participation of women in both conflict prevention and peacebuilding, thereby combating gross violations and abuses of their freedom and dignity. In the immediate future and within the framework of an open and inclusive process, we will seek the adoption of a resolution to prevent non-State actors and terrorists from having access to weapons \u2014 especially those with mass destruction capabilities that increase their ability to carry out assaults or attacks. We will also attempt to move forward international judicial cooperation against terrorism and step up measures against sexual violence in conflict.\nDuring this period in the Security Council, we have faced crises every day that stir our conscience and about which, despite much frustration, we refuse to become apathetic. Five and a half years of conflict in Syria have led to the death of more than 300,000 people, brought about the forced disappearance of more than half of Syria\u2019s people and divided the country, leaving it at serious risk of irreversible fragmentation. The stability of the entire region has been threatened, especially that of neighbouring nations, whose generosity in hosting Syrian refugees should be acknowledged. We regret the breach of the ceasefire agreement, and we express our sympathy for the victims, especially those who were humanitarian workers. We hope and call for another cessation of hostilities. In that context, Spain is working to improve humanitarian assistance. There is no military solution to the conflict, and the political solution must preserve the unity of the country in an inclusive, democratic framework.\nIraq suffers the ravages of terrorism at the hands of Da\u2019esh, which is already retreating thanks to the perseverance of the Iraqi Government and the support of an international coalition, of which Spain is a member. I reiterate our full support for the Government of Iraq in its efforts to build a democratic country in which members of all religious faiths and ethnicities can coexist and where human rights and the principle of territorial integrity are respected. Moreover, we are not giving up on any other seemingly deadlocked situation, whether in Yemen, Libya or Afghanistan.\nSpain supports United Nations efforts for a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that would allow for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara on terms compatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In April, the Security Council renewed the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara for one year. In that regard, Spain welcomes the restoration of the Mission\u2019s capabilities, in line with Security Council resolution 2285 (2016). We encourage the parties to resume their dialogue with a view to finally resolving that dispute.\nSpain has consolidated its relations with the African continent, whose strength and dynamism we commend and to which we are giving special and preferential treatment. We are following with concern the developments in the conflicts in South Sudan, Mali, Somalia and the Central African Republic. Spanish military operations have been deployed in those three countries in the framework of European Union operations, as well as in the various United Nations missions throughout the world.\nIn mentioning them here, I wish to pay tribute to all the Blue Helmets who are working to achieve peace in those missions, sometimes at the cost of their lives. Here, it would be only right to acknowledge the work of the African Union and subregional organizations that also make an extraordinary contribution to maintaining peace on the continent \u2014 an achievement in which Spain will continue to play an active part.\nOn a map of the world where shadows abound, hope also exists. Spain welcomed the agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme and also commends Iran\u2019s verification of compliance with the conditions to end the sanctions regime and open the door to a new trade regime with fixed restrictions. Our country is engaging in rigorous coordination efforts to assess trade requests.\nFew pieces of news would be more encouraging than the announcement of the resumption of peace talks between Israel and Palestine. Spain supports the holding of an international conference to help encourage the negotiating parties in the course of this year, which marks 25 years since the Madrid Conference. The two- State solution, with mutually agreed upon and secure borders, is the only way to achieve a fair and lasting peace. Denial and confrontation between communities must lead the way to peaceful coexistence. In that context, Spain will promote initiatives to encourage harmony among the civil societies of both parties.\nTwo and a half years ago, on our continent, Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity were violated. The European Union, Ukraine and Russia must be able to steer a course that will benefit us all in terms of European security and prosperity, on terms that respect the principles of international law and the values of democracy.\nWe follow with great concern the serious and repeated violations of the non-proliferation regime by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We call on them to focus their efforts on a genuine search for a climate of understanding and dialogue with the international community.\nAs for the European Union, the great project of coexistence is now at a major crossroads. As Jean Monnet indicated, the European project is not a given; it is something we have to create every day, on the basis of a community of both interests and people. The European Union is an act of resolve, of trust in the ability of our peoples to overcome past mistakes and not repeat them. Its sustainability and strengthening are key to peace and prosperity on our continent and are enormously positive factors, both as an example and because of the deployment of capabilitities that can benefit the United Nations as a whole. No one would gain if it were to become paralysed or fail.\nWe Spaniards are proud of belonging to the European Union, from which we have obtained undeniable benefits and to which we have made important contributions, including a number of sacrifices when these were necessary for the common good of Europe. In the current circumstances, we are ready to continue in the vanguard of the European Union\u2019s growth in all areas.\nAs Spain has always done from this rostrum, let me say that Gibraltar is the only remaining colony in Europe. In compliance with the United Nations mandate, I invite the United Kingdom to put an end that anachronism by an agreed solution between our two countries that restores the territorial integrity of Spain and benefits the population of the colony and the Gibraltar region.\nThis year is the last in the mandate of Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon. I would like to thank him on behalf of Spain for his outstanding service and to express my personal gratitude and appreciation. Spain welcomes the criteria of transparency and participation that are to guide us in selecting his successor. I trust that we will be able to make the best possible choice.\nSpain is a candidate for the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 period. I ask for the General Assembly\u2019s support for its candidature. The promotion and defence of human rights are a hallmark of our foreign policy. We are particularly committed to promoting gender equality, the right to drinking water and sanitation, the rights of people with disabilities and the fight against racism, xenophobia and hate crimes.\nThe United Nations has in Spain a Member that is committed to the values embodied in this Organization. We know that they rely on us to deal with the main challenges of today. We do this in the spirit of Don Quixote and the loyalty of Sancho Panza. As our universal classic tells us, \u201ceveryone is the architect of his own fortune\u201d. We Spaniards want to be the architects of a United Nations where fairness, happiness, the attainment of human rights and respect for human dignity will prevail at all times.\n"

I wish him every success in the noble task that has been conferred upon him. I would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for all the hard work he undertook during his presidency at the seventieth session of the General Assembly.\nI also with to take this opportunity to underscore the tireless work undertaken by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the service of peace and security. His skills, leadership and ability to keep a close eye on the major problems facing our planet and to react accordingly have enabled us to foster a spirit of tolerance, mutual understanding and cooperation at the international level.\nMauritania, under President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, is playing a crucial role in the maintenance of peace and security in the Sahel and Sahara regions through an approach based on openness, dialogue and professionalism. Despite a complex regional backdrop, our efforts have been successful, in particular in the fight against several terrorist groups and organizations, following lengthy struggles throughout 2010 and 2011.\nExperts agree nonetheless that Mauritania represents an exception in terms of its success in fighting terrorism and extremist violence. Having managed to quash these effectively since 2011, we have also reinforced our security and defence capabilities without undermining individual or collective liberties and freedoms. We have continued to focus our full attention on sustainable development and the needs of those who are most vulnerable within society.\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders, Mauritania has been ranked first among all Arab nations in terms of freedom of expression and freedom of the press for three years now. Furthermore, according to a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, Mauritania is the leading country in the subregion in the UNDP Human Development Index. We have succeeded in guaranteeing and ensuring freedom of expression and the right to protest, demonstrate and assemble, meaning that we escaped unscathed from the so-called Arab Spring, which afflicted so many of our Arab brothers.\nWe have maintained open channels of dialogue between the majority Government and the opposition since the elections in 2011. That has allowed us to undertake profound regulatory and legislative reforms, particularly regarding the empowerment of Mauritanian women and the strengthening of the values of citizenship, respect for others and social harmony.\nIt is our belief that security and development are intrinsically linked, which is why we have adopted a very robust policy to tackle corruption, particularly with regard to public expenditure and procurement. We have also set in motion a series of initiatives to root out corruption in the private sector. That has allowed us to raise the necessary funds to increase our security and also create youth employment opportunities. That rational and judicious policy has led to unprecedented progress and development in many economic sectors. Infrastructure, roads, ports, hospitals and universities have undergone major construction programmes, and there have been improvements in electricity production thanks to our use of both traditional and renewable energy resources. We have also increased the number of homes with direct access to safe drinking water, particularly for families that have been living in shanty towns for more than 50 years.\nMauritania straddles the Arab Mahgreb world and the Saharan world, with a long Atlantic coastline on one border and the Sahara desert on another. Because of our geographical location, we are a key player in the security and economic panorama of West Africa. It is our desire to create harmony and understanding between the subregions to which we belong \u2014 the Mahgreb and sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 through a policy of good neighbourliness. We have adopted a neutral policy by way of response to the various conflicts in our region and with regard to the conflict in Western Sahara. It has always been our desire to remain neutral and support the efforts of the United Nations to find a permanent solution to the Western Sahara conflict. It is a conflict that is holding back integration and development in our region, and there is an urgent need to solve it.\nOur credibility on a continental level was reflected during our presidency of the African Union in 2014. We also presided over the African Union Peace and Security Council in 2014, when we led and participated in many intiatives, especially in seeking to resolve the crises in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Libya, Mali and Burundi, to name but a few places. I am sure the Assembly recalls the courageous act of our President himself when he landed in Kidal, Mali, in a helicopter in 2014 during a period when the town was ravaged by conflict. Such a courageous act paved the way to the renewal of direct negotiations between the parties to the conflict. Furthermore, Mauritania is home to more than 60,000 Malian refugees in the Mbera camp in the east of the country.\nDespite our scarcity of material and human resources as well as of natural resources, and notwithstanding the sensitivity of our geopolitical situation, we have contributed to many peacekeeping operations upon the request of the United Nations. We have deployed contingents in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the Central African Republic, and the leaders of those missions have all spoken warmly of the professionalism and ethical behaviour of the Mauritanian troops. Furthermore, it gives me pleasure to say that members of the Mauritanian gendarmerie units deployed in the Central African Republic were awarded medals today by the United Nations.\nMauritania took the lead in organizing the Group of Five for the Sahel, with Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania as members, and we are honoured to currently occupy the post of Secretary-General of the Group. It is our responsibility to coordinate the actions of these five countries in matters of security and good governance, while focusing in particular on the needs of the most remote and least populated areas. We have developed various programmes and initiatives, which have drawn the favourable attention of our international partners.\nMauritania warmly welcomed the opportunity to host the latest Arab Summit. Despite the short notice and the complex set of circumstances currently faced by the Arab region, we were nonetheless glad to take on that responsibility. We are convinced that, whatever the differences may be among our countries, each Arab Summit provides a valuable opportunity to bring about reconciliation between our countries and to brainstorm about our present and our future together. This very well-organized Summit produced some excellent resolutions, and we believe it sent a strong message, received in many countries, to all who seek to hold Arab brotherhood responsible for the propagation of unacceptable messages and for wreaking havoc.\nWe feel that we bear responsibility towards the greater Arab nation. That is why we attach a great deal of importance to the rights of the Palestinian people and their right to enjoy dignity and sovereignty as a State. The Palestines have a right to an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital. It is our belief that the ongoing violations of human rights in Palestine and in other Arab territories occupied by Israel serve only to increase instability and further provoke the spread of violent extremism and terrorism throughout the world.\nWe would like to address all the parties to the bloody conflicts in countries such as Yemen, Libya and Syria, our brother Arab nations. We ask them to choose the path of wisdom with the best interests of their people at heart. We live in a global village where it is no longer possible to end conflict by military means, however strong an army might be.\nThe principle of the judicial immunity of States is a cornerstone of our international system, yet terrorism and violent extremism, together with drug trafficking, pose major challenges to international peace, security and order. Hence, States must develop synergies and join forces to tackle those challenges and overcome them together. Any national legislation that runs counter to international law, particularly as concers the judicial immunity of States, will undermine the efforts by the international community to tackle the aforementioned scourges.\nClimate change is also a major threat to sustainable development, particularly in the regions of the Sahel and the Sahara. Mauritania, as is the case for many countries in the subregion, must face that problem squarely. Since the desert sands of the Sahara cover much of our country\u2019s surface, environmental issues must necessarily cut across all aspects of our national policies, particularly those relating to economic development, if we are to pursue sustainable development. We have been able to limit the phenomenon of desertification. Thanks to our efforts and to the sponsorship of the President of the Republic of Mauritania, we have engaged in a tree-planting programme throughout the country to reverse the process of desertification. Our natural resources have also been included in an effective protection mechanism. Mauritania was chosen to host the Panafrican Agency of the Great Green Wall, an ambitious project of the African Union Commission that covers approximately 7,000 kilometres from west to east, linking the Atlantic coast with the Red Sea, in the fight against environmental degradation.\nWe have also been carefully protecting our fish stocks for future generations. We look favourably on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and it is our cherished hope that all parties will respect their commitments under it.\nMauritania aspires to the full implementation of an inclusive and ambitious work plan for cities and urban spaces that will flesh out the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 Goals and its 169 targets. The modernization of our cities and towns will provide decent living standards for inhabitants and will ensure that social inclusion is tailored to the requirements of each individual and each setting. It is important to ensure that social development planning meets the need for dignity and decent living standards in urban spaces. We hope that Habitat III, to be held in October in Quito, will be a success and fully reflect the aspirations and hopes of our people. Our desire is to be able to achieve a holistic and comprehensive solution that strikes a balance between urban and rural living conditions.\n"

        "file_text": "One year ago, here in this Hall, I warned the international community of the threat posed by the spread of international terrorism (see A/70/PV.17). What has happened in the year since then? Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Istanbul, Orlando, Munich, Nice and New York, again, is what happened.\nA few years ago, the number of countries that were influenced by Islamic terrorism was only six. Now, it is 35. The Islamic State is something like a cancer. But it is not only a tumor. Many cancers have metastases, which are more dangerous than the original tumor itself, and this is what we are observing in the spread of radicalism, terrorism and fanaticism. We must now ask, how long are we to wait before we act? How long are we going to be limited to conveying only condolences? How long will we be constrained to make only declarations of solidarity?\nI admit that there are some limited actions can be taken against terrorism, but they are, in fact, very limited, while terrorism is spreading all the time. There are three main risks in this area. The first is that, in the near future, there will be a new Islamic State in Afghanistan. If there is a reduction of NATO forces in Afghanistan, a victory by the Taliban is highly probable. If that were to happen, we can expect to see the same level of cruelty from the Taliban as that which we have seen from Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram and the Al-Nusra Front and others.\nThe second risk is the extremization or radicalization of the population, which is still quite unstable. Let me cite one unpleasant example. In the 1930s, in Germany, the population was also quite unstable despite the fact that it was a very cultivated population. After all, Germany is the nation of Goethe and Schiller. Over the course of a few years, this very decent nation became one of fanatical Nazis. It only took a few years. We must admit that such radicalization or extremization is also possible today.\nThe third risk stems from our hesitation and our lack of courage in carrying out decisive actions. My country, though small, has troops in Afghanistan, Mali and other parts of the world. That, however, is not enough. What we need is the coordinated action of most if not all States Members of the United Nations. But what can be done until that happens? Let me cite another example.\nWhat we need is a solid, firm, comprehensive United Nations platform on international terrorism. A proposal for such a platform was put forward by India in the year 2000 \u2014 16 years ago. Sixteen years later, we are still discussing how international terrorism should be defined. International lawyers have literally been discussing this issue for 16 years.\nThank God I am not an international lawyer. I say that because, for me, a terrorist is anybody who intentionally kills innocent civilian people. It is that simple: \u201cElementary, my dear Watson\u201d, as they say. Unfortunately, the United Nations has been discussing a programme \u2014 and the definition of international terrorism \u2014 for 16 years. As a result, I have some doubts about the efficiency of this international Organization. I hope the Acting President will excuse me for being so blunt. Obviously, this state of affairs is not satisfactory; we do not have the platform we need.\nLast year, I proposed the creation of an international force, equipped with drones, helicopters and air rangers and using improved communication among national secret services. I was very happy to learn that the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, our French colleague, proposed the same thing: using the experience with drones and helicopters in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to wage the fight against jihadists. What we need is not massive territorial operations \u2014 those have led to bad experiences in Iraq, Syria and Libya, where we were able to destroy, but we were not able to build; rather, we must attack the most sensitive points, the nerve centres of international terrorism, without occupying territory. We must attack the brain, not the body.\nI had hoped that there would be a Security Council resolution on combating terrorism, but again that did not happen. I read the first draft of such a resolution proposed by the Russian Federation, but that proposed draft resolution has not yet been adopted. Unfortunately, many of the Articles of the Charter of the United Nations, beginning with Article 39 and ending with Article 51, go unused. For example, Article 47, on the Military Staff Committee, is, in United Nations terminology, a \u201csleeping Article\u201d or a \u201csleeping structure\u201d. Let us therefore awaken it. Since we have those Articles and we have this Charter, we need to use them when the appropriate opportunity arises. For without those measures, without coordinated military action based on the common will of the permanent members of the Security Council, the spread of terrorism will continue, and we shall be faced with new assassinations, new failed countries and new terrorist actions throughout the world.\nLet me conclude with the old Roman oratorical phrase uttered frequently by Cato the Elder: \u201cCeterum autem censeo Carthaginem esse delendam\u201d \u2014 \u201cMoreover, I believe that Carthage must be destroyed\u201d. Deep in my heart I believe that someday we will overcome \u2014 not Carthage, but international terrorism.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, when this body met, we resolved collectively to take global action to transform our world in a manner that would bring about sustainable and equitable development. The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has set the stage for increasing international discourse and action in our fight against inequality, to combat climate change, to empower our citizens, to protect the vulnerable and to improve the lives of billions of people across the globe.\nToday, Dominica, like other small island developing States (SIDS), remains motivated and committed to achieving the SDGs. For my country, the realization of the SDGs is not simply about ticking boxes. Fundamentally, it is about making a real and meaningful difference in the lives of our citizens. However, in order for those essential changes to take place, we must each do more at the national level, and all countries must deliver on their commitments in accordance with their respective means. That effort will require more structured and effective partnerships.\nAdditionally, as we focus our minds on the SDGs, we must also sharpen our focus on the impact that climate change continues to have on the development of SIDS. In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in agricultural production. We are also experiencing more severe and prolonged droughts, often followed by sudden and high volumes of rainfall, which result in massive soil erosion and catastrophic loss and damage.\nLikewise, the ongoing phenomenon of beach erosion and destruction of coral reefs \u2014 so vital to our tourism product and the character of our islands \u2014 risks untold damage to our prized tourism assets. Consequently, the economic impact on SIDS is dire. More urgent and wide-ranging action is needed in the fight against climate change to ensure our very survival. To that end, we look forward to building on the momentum of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as we move on to the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Marrakesh later this year.\nAs many will recall, a little over a year ago the Commonwealth of Dominica was painfully reminded of the devastating impact of climate change. In less than 24 hours, Tropical Storm Erika took the lives of 30 Dominicans and wreaked havoc on our country\u2019s physical and social infrastructure. That single climatic event caused damage estimated at EC$1.3 billion, or $483 million, which accounted for 90 per cent of the island\u2019s gross domestic product.\nOne year on, we are making great strides and are on track to build back better and to build increasingly climate-resilient and adaptive infrastructure. While we commend the Dominicans\u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 for their support and dedication, our progress has been made easier through the partnership and support of our bilateral and multilateral partners. We therefore take this opportunity to thank them publicly for their invaluable contribution to our rebuilding efforts.\nI can say that Dominica\u2019s experience with Tropical Storm Erika is all too common in the lives of SIDS. We continue to suffer the disproportionate burden and impact of climate change, which also severely undermines our efforts at sustainable development. Also troubling are the slow-onset events and the extreme weather events that are brought on as a result of climate change. These are expected to become more frequent and more destructive. What that means for us, in real terms, is that limited resources, which should be targeted at transformative and sustainable development, of necessity have to be continuously shifted to post- disaster rehabilitation.\nThat is why Dominica continues its call for collaboration in the establishment of an international natural disaster risk fund, to provide timely financial support to SIDS affected by natural disasters. The current Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility within the Caribbean Development Bank for Caribbean SIDS, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s support for disaster recovery and the World Bank\u2019s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery are good starting points. Regrettably, in the face of the enormous challenge, their funding levels remain vastly insufficient. We would be encouraged if the capitalization of this special natural disaster risk fund were to come from the parties to annex I of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and other major emitters, including voluntary contributors. We believe that such a facility would enable SIDS to access and secure funds in a more predictable and timely manner and to rebuild more robust infrastructure through effective technical assistance and physical development planning. It would also help these climate-vulnerable countries to build increasingly climate-resilient economies and to identify vulnerable areas that need to be adapted and mitigated to better deal with any future catastrophic event.\nThe Government of Dominica is also taking effective steps at the national level to improve its ability to respond and deliver in post-disaster situations. This year, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit outlined a proposal to establish a national vulnerability risk and resilience fund. The fund aims to ensure that the Government has immediate access to financial resources in the event of a natural disaster. The fund would also be used to finance climate-resilient projects and programmes. The capitalization of the fund will come from Government revenue and returns from the Government\u2019s investments in renewable energy projects that have already been implemented with grants and concessionary financing through the Green Climate Fund. Two projects have already been identified: the geothermal energy project and a national waste-to- energy project.\nToday\u2019s interconnectedness of global markets make access to the global financial system a prerequisite to economic development and a sine qua non for sustainable development. The free movement of goods and services depends on the ability of the public and private sectors to move financial resources throughout the world. Therefore, recent actions taken by several international banks in the United States and across Europe to terminate correspondent banking relations with indigenous banks in the Caribbean have made it difficult for the Caribbean to do business with the rest of the world. The consequences are far-reaching. It has affected the transmission of remittances, undermined foreign investments, restricted the repatriation of profits and restricted our national and indigenous banks\u2019 ability to participate effectively in the international financial systems, even though they have not been found guilty of any financial or security breaches.\nThe Governments of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have long recognized and supported the need for common global action against the financing of terrorism, money laundering, organized crime and other illegal activities. Our countries have worked diligently with non-regional Governments and international institutions like the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and have instituted domestic legislation to fight money laundering, restrict the financing of terrorism and seize the proceeds of crime.\nOur leaders acknowledge that the de-risking of correspondent banks is a direct response to the regulatory requirements imposed by those jurisdictions in which they operate. We want to see action to remedy its harmful effects on us. The unintended consequences threaten our very economic survival. The solution lies, we believe, in meaningful dialogue between and among States. Through dialogue, we hope to see the creation of rules-based standards and mechanisms that govern the establishment and maintenance of correspondent banking relationships and regulatory changes under which the respondent banks, instead of correspondent banks, would be sanctioned for violations in connection with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, thereby removing the burden of compliance from the latter.\nLike most challenges of global magnitude, that calls for strong international partnerships. One such partnership is the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, which we believe presents a blueprint for such modalities. It also highlights durable and genuine partnerships as a cornerstone for achieving the SDGs in SIDS. Additionally, we believe that South- South, North-South and Triangular cooperation have served and will continue to serve as an effective platform for technology transfer and capacity-building. We thank our developed country partners, which continue to play a major role in our development and in our efforts to realize the SDGs. Over the years, those countries have stood steadfastly with us in our commitment to improve the lives of our people. Assistance with developing sustainable agriculture, tourism and energy, especially with geothermal energy development, have set the platform for sustainable social and economic development, while at the same time combating climate change.\nWe strongly believe, however, that an effective strategy to realize the SDGs will require an overhaul of the manner in which official development assistance (ODA) is executed. ODA must be more informed by the realities in the recipient countries, more predictable, and accessible in a timely manner. For instance, the very unrealistic and arbitrary classification of several small island developing States as middle-income countries, based on the flawed notion of gross domestic product per capita, is yet another way in which the efforts of small countries at building economic resilience and sustainable development are systematically undermined. It is a tendency that completely obscures the reality in SIDS and ignores their inherent characteristics of vulnerability. We will continue to draw attention to the unsuitability of those categorizations.\nAt the same time, SIDS will continue to explore opportunities within the framework of South-South cooperation. We have recently been encouraged by the increasing levels of partnership among and between countries of the South. The role of China has become integral to South-South cooperation, and China has demonstrated its willingness and capacity to assist developing countries in critical areas of development. These have included funding for and the construction of essential physical infrastructure, as well as providing assistance in the form of equipment, the delivery of health-care services and human resources development.\nEqually, countries such as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Cuba continue to make a durable and significant impact on the health care, education and energy landscape of Dominica. Cuba has the capacity to make an even greater contribution to our region and the world, once the economic embargo is lifted. Dominica is encouraged by the recent improvement in relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America. We applaud President Obama\u2019s initiative as progressive and worthy of international support. The critical next step, however, should be the removal of all other impediments to trade and economic activities, so that Cuba can fully benefit from the international trading and financial systems.\nEven in the face of its own domestic challenges, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela continues to be a reliable partner in development. Our partnership with the Bolivarian Republic, especially over the past decade, has contributed significantly to our own tangible achievements under the Millennium Development Goals through initiatives such as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our America and the PetroCaribe Energy Cooperation Agreement. We look forward to our continued partnership and hope for a peaceful and amicable resolution of its current difficulties. A peaceful and stable hemisphere is in the interest of all of us.\nWithin the Caribbean subregion, we continue to strengthen and deepen both bilateral and multilateral partnerships to promote development and our effort to achieve the SDGs. The role of regional institutions like CARICOM and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States has become even more essential in terms of social and economic development. That is why we have built institutions that serve the people of our region in every aspect of development. Our regional approach to our common challenges has also garnered better results than if we were to face them individually. CARICOM now provides a critical interface with our development partners in trade, energy, and social and economic development.\nIn the area of energy, CARICOM has adopted and is currently implementing the Caribbean Sustainable Energy Roadmap and Strategy. The goal of the Roadmap and Strategy is to transform the energy sectors of the member States by providing secure and sustainable supplies of clean, reliable and affordable energy with stable prices in order to better position the Caribbean Community to achieve the SDGs. As a result, CARICOM has been partnering with other countries and organizations, both formally and informally, to assist its members.\nOne such partnership exists with the Government of Austria, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the SIDS Sustainable Energy and Climate Resilience Initiative to create the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. The Centre will serve as a hub for coordinating Caribbean-wide renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. We expect it to play a major role in the implementation of the CARICOM energy policies.\nGiven its paramount importance to the future prosperity and sustainable development of the SIDS, I would like briefly to highlight SDG 14, which refers to protection of our seas, oceans and marine resources. The world\u2019s oceans and seas are sources of nourishment and nutrition to billions, a major tourism asset and an important part of our complex ecosystem. International actions to protect the health of our oceans and seas should be pursued as a matter of urgency. Small and large countries should come together to coordinate efforts and to create a system to regulate activities that affect our oceans and seas.\nWe commend the efforts and initiatives taken by the Friends of the Oceans group, the Government of Italy and, most recently, United States Secretary of State John Kerry. The recent Our Ocean Conference in Washington, D.C., like its predecessors, highlighted the need to draw greater attention to the ongoing destruction of our oceans resulting from marine pollution and its implications for humankind. We need innovative and global responses. We must also improve public awareness and education on marine pollution and highlight the best practices to protect our oceans.\nIn that regard, we commend the efforts of representatives and countries advancing the We Are The Oceans concept. Dominica is happy to associate with this initiative, which promotes food security, sustainable consumption and production, ocean conservation and biodiversity as a way to meet, or even exceed, the commitments made by our leaders. We are The Oceans holds great potential for making the issue of our seas and oceans one of the most extensive educational initiatives of the SDGs. We urge Member States to join and to work collectively to save our planet for future generations. Collectively, we have the ability to solve the most difficult challenges of our time\nThe unprecedented pace of human advancement in the twenty-first century has demonstrated that we have the capacity and ingenuity to combat climate change and to develop means of production and consumption to sustain humankind, while at the same time protecting our planet.\nOur efforts to save our planet and to improve the lives of billions of people throughout the world \u2014 people who suffer from hunger and starvation and those who continue to be marginalized \u2014 will be pointless without peace and security. The destruction wrought by wars within and between countries continues to displace millions of people from their homes, creating an unprecedented refugee crisis.\nThe threat posed by nuclear weapons, and especially by the determination of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to develop weapons with the ability to kill millions, is a major threat not only to the neighbours of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea but to people everywhere. The United Nations must, without hesitation, take strong and decisive\n16-29811 51/52 action to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the war in Syria and to eliminate the nuclear capability of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Similarly, we must, as a matter of urgency, work together to defeat the increasing threat of global terrorism. It is up to us to take the necessary actions.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and the Government of Nigeria, Sir, let me congratulate the President on his well-deserved election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I assure him of Nigeria\u2019s support in steering the affairs of the General Assembly over the next 12 months. I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the achievements recorded during his tenure.\nLast year, I presented my first address to the General Assembly after my assumption of office as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (see A/70/\n14/18 16-29302 PV.15). Indeed, it was a remarkable year, which not only celebrated the gains of the Millennium Development Goals but also witnessed the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These landmark achievements by the global community will without any doubt build a more prosperous, all-inclusive world. We must work together to liberate humankind from poverty, save our planet from the devastation of climate change and rid the world of terrorism for a more peaceful and prosperous future.\nWe must remain committed to taking bold steps to transform our world. The Sustainable Development Goals underscore the imperative for our collective will towards finding enduring and sustainable solutions to addressing global disparities. It is in the light of our appreciation of the enormity of the task before us that I welcome the theme of the Assembly: \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d.\nNigeria, as a developing country, has been adversely affected by the global economic downturn. We are, however, undeterred and have embarked upon a wide range of reforms in our efforts to diversify our economy and shift emphasis to mining, agriculture, industrialization, infrastructure development and the creation of an enabling environment for foreign direct investment. Our strategic objective is to stimulate the economy, restore growth and accelerate recovery. In doing that, we are taking measures to reduce the cost of governance and increase expenditure on infrastructure and ensure environmental best practices.\nFighting corruption remains a cardinal pillar of our Administration. Corruption freezes development, thereby undermining the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. I am pleased that our efforts in fighting corruption are yielding positive results, including significant recoveries of stolen assets. The recovered funds are being channelled towards the development of critical infrastructure and the implementation of social inclusion programmes for our people. We are also strengthening the capacity of Government entities to institutionalize reforms to ensure transparency and good governance.\nThe Anti-Corruption Summit held in London in May this year served as further assurance of the global community\u2019s commitment to fight corruption through the proposed practical steps to address the challenges, including actions to hold perpetrators to justice within the law. Nigeria supports the development of an international legal framework to enforce anti-corruption measures and strengthen existing international institutions to effectively deal with corrupt practices.\nNigeria calls on Member States that are yet to sign up to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to do so. Nigeria will continue to advocate for the facilitation of the recovery of illicit financial assets. Indeed, the speedy and unconditional return of stolen public assets should be the focus of the follow-up anti-corruption conference, to be hosted by the United States and United Kingdom next year in Washington, D.C.\nFurthermore, Nigeria remains committed to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global coalition that promotes transparency and accountability in the management of revenues from the oil, gas and solid minerals sectors. We voluntarily signed up to the Initiative because we are convinced that transparent governance is an imperative for resource-rich developing countries like ours. Through the work that our national chapter of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative has done over the years, it is clear that our faith is not misplaced. The Initiative has been empowering citizens with the critical information they can use to hold Government and other players in the extractive industries to account, and make recommendations that drive reforms in those strategic sectors of our national life.\nThe world took a giant step in Paris towards addressing the challenges of climate change. Nigeria is proud to have been part of the process leading to the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 at the twenty-first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That meeting marked a watershed in the global community\u2019s commitment to address climate change, and we will continue in our determined efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. At the centre of Nigeria\u2019s climate action is our determination to implement the strategies in our intended nationally determined contributions, which will foster a low- carbon economy and sustainable growth in building a climate-resilient society. We are creating public awareness through the integrated involvement of the private sector and civil society and by strengthening national institutions and mechanisms.\nThe negative consequences of climate change have manifested themselves in the drying up of our Lake Chad. The means of livelihood of an estimated 30 million inhabitants of the Lake Chad Basin \u2014 spread across Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and Nigeria \u2014 are being severely threatened. The cost of replenishing the lake has been put at $14 billion, under a five-year plan that should be accorded global attention. Nigeria also supports the African Union initiative on the Great Green Wall to halt desertification.\nIn furtherance of our commitment to environmental sustainability, Nigeria has launched the Clean Up Ogoniland initiaitve in Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta, based on the 2011 environmental assessment of the area by the United Nations Environment Programme. Multinational oil companies operating in the area will be required to live up to their corporate social responsibilities and contribute to the cleaning-up of the environment, degraded as a result of their activities and operations. We call on development partners and multinationals to support our efforts through the Ogoniland Restoration Fund.\nThe twenty-first century has thus far been marked by the rising insecurity unleashed by global terrorism and violent extremism, which constitute a real threat to the international community. With the global increase in the spate of terrorist attacks, there is now, more than ever, international consensus and greater willingness to collaborate in combating the threat. Indeed, we are meeting at the time when our hosts, the American people, have just marked the fifteenth anniversary of the tragic and dastardly terrorist attacks on their soil. We in Nigeria, having been victims of terrorism ourselves, fully understand the impact of 9/11 on the American psyche and the families of the thousands of innocent victims whose lives were lost that day. I therefore reiterate the sympathies of the Nigerian Government and the Nigerian people to the American people, along with prayers for the families of the victims that they may heal and find closure soon.\nWe hope that justice will be done for the families of victims of 9/11, as indeed to the victims of terror everywhere, in conformity with the norms of international justice. As we seek justice for terrorism victims, the international community should avoid reacting in the heat of the deep emotions of the moment by taking unilateral measures, legal or otherwise, that will have a negative and disruptive impact on the international community\u2019s collective efforts to fight terrorism. We should not be distracted in our collective resolve to beat back terrorism in all its forms.\nAs we confront terrorism, we must also commit to stopping the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which nurtures its spread. To that end, Nigeria urges Member States that are yet to sign and ratify the Arms Trade Treaty to do so without further delay.\nNigeria has made remarkable progress in its resolve to defeat Boko Haram, whose capacity to launch orchestrated attacks as a formed group has been severely degraded. In the past few months, their operations have been limited to sporadic use of improvised explosive devices against soft targets.\nNigeria has continued to combat terrorism on the basis of the established rules of engagement and in conformity with international best practices. I take this opportunity to reaffirm Nigeria\u2019s commitment to human rights norms and international humanitarian law in our efforts to counter terrorism and violent extremism. I also wish to restate the assurance that the Federal Government of Nigeria is employing all its judicial tools to investigate and address reported cases of human rights violations.\nI commend the contributions of our neighbours \u2014 the Republic of Benin, the Republic of Cameroon, the Republic of Chad and the Republic of the Niger \u2014 whose combined efforts under the Multinational Joint Task Force accomplished the present return of normalcy in areas hitherto occupied by Boko Haram. May I also thank our international partners \u2014 including France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Germany, the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union \u2014 and many other multilateral and bilateral partners for their invaluable support. Our experience today is proof that, with determined international collaboration, terrorism can be defeated.\nThe flow of refugees and migrants worldwide has reached alarming proportions. That is why Nigeria supports the ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States and Russia to end the atrocious tragedy of the Syrian civil war. Of particular concern to us in Nigeria is the plight of internally displaced persons resulting from Boko Haram\u2019s terrorism. We have taken concrete steps to address their humanitarian needs and to ensure that the necessary conditions are established to enable the voluntary return of the displaced persons to their places of abode in safety and dignity.\nAt the same time, the Palestinian issue, despite years and years of international efforts, is no nearer to being resolved. Nigeria, in company with States members of the African Union, firmly supports the two-State solution, with Palestinian rights to statehood in conformity with numerous Security Council resolutions, beginning with resolution 242 (1967).\nLet me take this opportunity to once again thank all United Nations and other aid agencies and development partners currently deployed in north-east Nigeria. I reaffirm Nigeria\u2019s commitment to collective action towards an effective global response to address the root causes of refugee flows worldwide.\nWe acknowledge the importance of youth in national development and remain committed to harnessing the potential of the increasing youth bulge. We must take advantage of the numbers and creative energy of young people, who are in the majority in Nigeria and in most other Member States. Therefore, at the international level, we call for the establishment of a specialized United Nations agency for youth development to achieve that strategic objective.\nNuclear security remains central to our quest for durable peace and security. That was why I participated in the fifth Nuclear Security Summit, hosted by President Barak Obama in Washington in March 2016. Nigeria and the other peace-loving States Members of the United Nations must continue to uphold the fundamental principles of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\nThe United Nations should now redouble the long- protracted effort for its reform to enable it to effectively address the challenges of our times. Nigeria therefore reiterates its call for the reform of the Security Council, in particular to reflect equitable and fair representation and greater transparency, legitimacy and inclusiveness in its decision-making. Africa should be adequately represented on the Security Council in the permanent- member category. In that regard, Nigeria stands ready to serve Africa and the world on a reformed Security Council to advance international peace and security.\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Nigeria\u2019s abiding faith in the United Nations and in its capacity to support Member States to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Senegal wishes to thank the former President of the General Assembly for his efforts during the previous session and wishes the current President every success in the carrying out of his mandate.\nWe are gathered here once again to breathe new life into the founding principles of the United Nations, to promote peace and progress and to cultivate the spirit of tolerance and mutual understanding among peoples. Nevertheless, the world has never been so violent or dangerous as it is now, as innocent people, whose only mistake was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, are being killed without reason, leaving entire families plunged into grief and mourning. No cause, certainly no religious cause, can justify violence. The height of cowardice is attacks against priests and imams, including at religious sites.\nSenegal \u2014 a land of cultural and religious diversity, where the Muslim 95 per cent of the population live in harmony with their Christian fellow countrymen and people of other traditional religions \u2014 firmly condemns and rejects violence in all of its forms and manifestations. By the same token, we reject facile and unjust assignments of blame. Neither Islam nor Muslims are to blame for what we are witnessing. We refuse to have the senseless acts of a faithless, lawless minority be used as a pretext for stigmatizing more than 1 billion Muslims and their religion. When imams are killed and mosques are attacked, including acred Islamic sites, it is Muslims whose faith and very core are being attacked. We must therefore not condemn Muslims for actions of which they themselves are the victims. It is high time to cease the madness and Islamophobic slurs.\nSenegal is concerned every time measures target Muslim countries and communities, in violation of human rights and the rules that govern international relations. To lapse into senseless Islamophobia only compounds suffering with more suffering. It stokes antagonism and exacerbates the clash of civilizations, which plays into the hands of extremists of all stripes. Given the global terrorist threat affecting us all, good sense dictates the need to cooperate to vanquish evil with a global, united and concerted response.\nThe values that bring us together and make each of our peoples feel like part of the United Nations family derive from the fact that all civilizations and cultures are equal in dignity. Therefore, since we are the United Nations, let us apply the same commitment and diligence to tackling all of the challenges we face, from Syria to Libya, from South Sudan to Somalia, from Northern Mali to countries plagued by the criminal activities of the Boko Haram terrorist group. Let us give the same priority to all threats to international peace and security.\nLet us finally work to arrive at a fair solution to the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one which upholds the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a State living side by side with Israel in peace, each within secure and internationally recognized borders. Let us extend the same respect and humanity to all migrants, refugees and displaced persons, regardless of their origin.\nLet us finally rectify the historical injustice of a Security Council without a permanent seat for Africa, the only continent in that situation. I would recall in that connection that Africa accounts for nearly one third of United Nations Members, and that issues involving Africa form the bulk of the work of the Security Council. Senegal will continue its mandate in the Security Council. We remain wedded to the African position, as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus. We remain open to dialogue with those whose opinions differ from ours.\nLast year, we adopted the Agenda for Sustainable Development for the period up until 2030, and we adopted the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. With the theme of this session, which calls for a universal effort to transform our world, we have a fresh opportunity to translate our commitments into action. For African countries, the issue of energy remains a vital challenge, because there can be neither industrialization nor development without access to electricity at competitive costs. Africa cannot continue to enlighten other continents with its resources, while it itself remains in the dark. Africa cannot continue to serve as a reservoir for raw materials, processed elsewhere to the detriment of its own industrialization. Africa cannot remain the continent that is most affected by climate change, even though our contribution to carbon dioxide emissions related to electricity is at the lowest level, expected to reach only 3 per cent in 2040.\nThe Paris Agreement, which we signed in April, compels us to work together and calls for developing countries, especially in Africa, not to adopt the same polluting patterns as industrialized countries. To that end, the African Union last July launched a support fund to provide electricity to Africa. The fund is housed at the African Development Bank, and its aim is to mobilize financing for electricity projects as part of an energy mix. On behalf of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development, the steering committee of which Senegal chairs, I commend the support of France and Germany for that initiative. I invite all bilateral and multilateral partners to contribute to the financing of the fund for providing energy to Africa, in line with the commitments made under the Paris Agreement to finance mitigation and adaptation measures.\nFurthermore, I call for a different view of development challenges in Africa. Let us set aside the clich\u00e9s of a bygone past. Let us not look at Africa as a land of humanitarian emergencies and a receptacle for official development assistance, but rather as a continent that is being built, a centre for development and progress. Africa is a continent of roads and highways, of bridges and railways, of dams and power plants, of industrial zones and modern agricultural farms. That is our ambition for our countries. We cannot achieve that ambition through assistance, only through large-scale urgent investments in sectors that generate growth and development. We wish to depend mainly on the mobilization of our own resources through more effective public spending, greater and fairer remuneration for our raw materials, regulated taxation and a more robust struggle against illicit financial flows.\nIn that connection, Senegal supports the plan to combat tax-base erosion and profit-shifting, which was initiated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20, with support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. At the same time, I would call for the immediate implementation of the \u201cStrengthening assistance for complex contract negotiations\u201d initiative of the Group of Seven, especially in the area of mines and hydrocarbons. We wish to see fair and balanced contracts that protect both the interests of the investor and the rights of the host country.\nFinally, I would call upon all public and private partners not to overestimate the investment risks in Africa. Africa has achieved significant progress in terms of good governance and improvements in the business climate. The risk there is not greater than elsewhere, and clearly, for a global economy that is currently suffering, Africa does not pose risks. Rather, the continent affords opportunities for recovery and shared growth. Let us work to reform global financing so as to alleviate the conditions limiting access to credit for development financing.\nBy drawing upon our faith in a new Africa, for two years we have continued to implement the Emerging Senegal Plan through major infrastructure projects, notably central electric-power plants, a new urban centre, transportation infrastructure, including a second toll road, and the forthcoming launch of a regional express train line linking Dakar to our new international airport, soon to be finished.\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the Secretary- General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for all his efforts and service to the United Nations in this difficult time.\nI also wish to pay tribute to President Barak Obama of the United States for his contribution to the international agenda over the course of his two presidential terms. The path taken by President Obama through the decision of the American people is a historic message, a universal message, a message inviting every person to overcome the shadows of their own prejudice to embrace the light of wisdom. It is a message of humanity that is reminiscent of the eloquent words delivered by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. 53 years ago in front of the Lincoln Memorial, that people \u201cwill not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d.\nWhat holds true for humankind also holds true for nations. There are no large and small nations; there are united nations. And since we are the United Nations, all voices must count when we deliberate on our common issues. I wish the General Assembly every success in its work.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to join fellow leaders at the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, which affords us an opportunity to undertake the most effective global response to the challenges for which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was elaborated.\nI congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency for this session, and am particularly pleased that the representative of a small island developing State is presiding over our Assembly. I am confident that his deliberations during this session will translate into meaningful commitments and actions under his able leadership.\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his contribution to the work of the United Nations over the past 10 years. He is to be commended for his tireless efforts in guiding the Organization, allowing it to remain at the forefront of international dialogue, consensus-building and cooperation.\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September last year, we, as a global community, have committed ourselves to securing the well-being of all peoples. Jamaica is mindful, however, that for this outcome to be realized, national efforts must be complemented by global partnerships. Indeed, we are conscious that transforming our world is the responsibility of all of us \u2014 of every nation and every individual. Under my leadership, despite the challenges, we in Jamaica are fully committed and are laying the foundation for accelerated, sustained economic growth.\nLike many other countries, our path towards sustainable development has been hindered by years of low growth, crippling national debt and high unemployment, which have been exacerbated by our vulnerability to natural hazards and other exogenous shocks. Consistent with the priorities of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the global Sustainable Development Goals, my Government is implementing strategies to achieve economic growth, job creation, security and poverty alleviation. Those are our overriding objectives for the next four years. We are forging stronger partnerships with our private sector and undertaking structural reforms to foster an enabling business environment, which will make Jamaica a more attractive destination for local and foreign direct investment. We are also resolute in our commitment to ensuring that economic activity is undertaken in a manner that not only protects and preserves our natural environment, but that also develops our most important asset \u2014 the people of Jamaica. We will also continue to develop a social protection network that is essential to safeguarding the welfare of the most vulnerable in our society.\nWhile we pursue a self-reliant path, I must bring to the attention of the General Assembly a matter that requires international cooperation. Highly indebted middle-income countries (HIMIC) like Jamaica are poised for economic transition with the attainment of relatively high levels of health and education. However, in a climate of historically low economic growth, this potential is gravely threatened by our having to choose between debt repayment and catalytic growth spending.\nJamaica has no choice. Jamaica must repay its debts, and we are repaying our debts. However, the consequence of this is that no resources are available for the Government to make the kinds of public investment that stimulate economic growth. In addition, spending on critical issues, such as security \u2014 the absence of which negatively impacts growth \u2014 is compromised. In these circumstances, developing countries would previously be able to tap into development assistance that can be used for growth-inducing countercyclical investment in infrastructure, which in turn strengthens debt-repayment capacity. However, arbitrary classification, on the basis of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, precludes HIMIC countries from accessing such resources. The problem is that while GDP per capita gives an indication of average incomes, it says nothing about a country\u2019s stock of wealth, nor does it take into account the vulnerabilities that some countries face.\nFurthermore, some HIMIC countries such as Jamaica have made deep structural and fiscal reforms to improve fiscal management and achieve debt sustainability, ensuring that we will never return to unsustainably high levels of debt. However, in the absence of an abundance of unused spare capacity in our economies, these reforms will not immediately kick- start the growth cycle. Instead, new investment needs to follow at a scale and velocity that are difficult to undertake without the full engagement of international development institutions. This creates the prospect of a HIMIC trap \u2014 a situation where countries are at the cusp of transitioning but are stalled and at risk of reversal.\nThe presumption that middle-income country status obviates the need for ongoing access to official development assistance and concessional financing is not supported by empirical evidence. The potential HIMIC trap threatens hard-won development gains and countries such as ours have for some time been highlighting this problem. Yet the prospect of a HIMIC trap has not yet triggered a change in the mindset of those who preside over the decision-making process that directly influences our global, economic and financial outlook. I re-emphasize that a review of this broad categorization of countries, based solely on GDP per capita, must be undertaken, as this measure, in isolation, fails to fully and accurately take account of added vulnerabilities and levels of indebtedness. There are various other measures of development that should be taken into account.\nSeveral years ago, the international community nobly responded to the problem of unsustainable debt in poor countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, guided by the principle that no poor country should face a debt burden that it cannot manage. We supported this then, and we support it now on a similar principle for highly indebted middle-income countries.\nHowever, the time has come for the international community to similarly converge around a HIMIC initiative, underpinned by the principle that highly indebted countries that have undiversifiable structural vulnerabilities, such as small size or susceptibility to the effects of climate change, and that responsibly and faithfully service their debt should be facilitated with assistance in the form of investment, favourable trade, technology transfer, security cooperation and energy.\nTo qualify for inclusion in the HIMIC initiative, a country, in addition to being a highly indebted middle-income country, should have undiversifiable structural vulnerabilities and a demonstrated track record of commitment to economic, fiscal and social reform programmes supported by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The collective size of the problem is such that a HIMIC initiative would not burden the international system. However, the potential impact of assisting these countries in transitioning would put more countries in a position to make greater contributions to the international system in the near future.\nJamaica is pursuing reforms to enhance the efficiency of the public sector, improving its customer service delivery, pursuing economies of scale, reducing duplication and aligning the public sector towards enabling and facilitating economic growth and development. While we pursue reforms aimed at boosting fiscal sustainability and growth, we are also looking at innovative ways to match our financing needs with sustainable development objectives.\nJamaica will work with development partners to pursue debt-for-climate-change swaps. This holds the potential of providing bilateral and multilateral relief for climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Such a mechanism has the potential to provide fiscal relief while helping to unlock pledged climate financing to fund adaptation and mitigation initiatives. As a country vulnerable to climate, Jamaica will play its part to close the climate implementation gap, while at the same time addressing our debt overhang. This has the potential to be a ground-breaking approach.\nPeace and security are a Sustainable Development Goal. They is often spoken about in the context of peace between States. However, peace within States is just as important. Jamaica, like much of the Caribbean and Central America, is challenged by crime. This has had a destructive impact on families \u2014 particularly poor families \u2014 deterred investment and discouraged businesses. In sections of Jamaica crime threatens the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. Tackling crime is a priority for our Government. While the Jamaican Government will do its part, the common problem we face in our region requires deeper security cooperation.\nThe international community must also move with greater alacrity towards eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Jamaica is acutely aware of the destruction that can be wrought as a result of easy access to small arms and light weapons, particularly when in the possession of sophisticated networks of organized criminal groups. Our strategic location, which is extremely favourable for trade and logistics, also provides a potential transit point for illicit activities.\nIt is this reality that has defined and propelled our participation in a range of bilateral, regional and multilateral arrangements aimed at restricting the source, means and capabilities that have fuelled these dangerous relationships, made even more destructive through links to the drug trade. Jamaica has been a staunch supporter of the Arms Trade Treaty, and we are working towards its full and effective implementation. We call on all arms-exporting countries to abide by their legally binding obligations under the Treaty. Jamaica was honoured to have chaired the recently convened Sixth Biennial Meeting of States to consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.\nWe need to effectively address the emerging crisis of the withdrawal of correspondent banking services from certain financial institutions in the Caribbean. De-risking threatens our economies. It tends to hinder our participation in the global financial system and in international trade, which in turn creates serious obstacles to our efforts to promote investment. We respect and have been complying with financial regulatory standards and working within a rules- based, multilateral trade and financial system. Trade represents 70 per cent of the Jamaican economy and de-risking measures therefore threaten our integration and economic viability. We therefore encourage our international partners to take an approach that establishes principles for ensuring inclusive development strategies based on a country\u2019s ability to engage in vibrant, dynamic international trade.\nIn the area of global trade, Jamaica realizes that the continued economic embargo of our sister Caribbean country, Cuba, is out of step with the recent actions that have been taken to re-establish diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. We therefore urge that it be lifted as soon as possible.\nThe hallmark of any civilized society is how it treats its most vulnerable members. We must address the issue of preventing violence against them, particularly our women and children, as a priority. We must seek to empower our women to realize their full potential. Jamaica has a long track record of championing the rights of women and will continue to advocate for full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Nor can we leave our children behind. If they are to realize their full potential, they must be given the opportunity to live in an environment that is free from fear and violence. That resolve is what undergirds our support for the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children.\nThe international community must scale up cooperation in order to respond to the growing and deepening health crises that have gripped our world. Jamaica, like many other countries, continues to struggle with preventing and controlling the common risk factors associated with the prevalence of non-communicable and new and emerging diseases. The emerging and resurgent epidemics associated with the transnational movement of microbes such as Ebola, Zika and chikungunya represent a severe challenge for national budgets. The recently concluded high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance and HIV/AIDS also highlighted another problem for the global health situation that must be halted if we are to ensure that our citizens have full and productive lives.\nAnother issue that demands continued cooperation at the global, regional and national levels is our response to climate change and the increasing occurrence of natural disasters, including extreme weather-related phenomena. Such events, increasingly spurred by man-made activity, continue to be a clear and present danger for many societies, particularly small island developing States. Recent experience has shown us that no country or group of countries can be considered to be beyond the reach of such events. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction provide us with a blueprint for action to ensure that our development efforts do not compromise the ability of future generations to enjoy a world in which their needs can be adequately met. I can assure the Assembly that Jamaica remains committed to the implementation of those agreements and will work to continue the effective implementation of the commitments they contain.\nAs the host country for the International Seabed Authority, we attach great importance to matters pertaining to the law of the sea. Jamaica supports the development of a legally binding international instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and is actively participating in the negotiations on such an instrument.\nJamaica has had a long and fruitful association with the United Nations that we value greatly. We are firm in our commitment to multilateralism and the continued strengthening of the Organization. We stand on the threshold of a world of possibilities, a world in which all can be given the opportunity to realize their full potential and where every nation State can better provide for the well-being of its citizens. We must not just live up to that expectation; we must surpass it. At this seventy-first session of the Assembly, let us recommit to the noble ideals of this Organization and its Charter, and to achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Let us join together, in the spirit of the national pledge of Jamaica, to advance the welfare of the whole human race.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government and my people, it is an honour and a privilege for me to address the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I bring warm greetings and good wishes from our President, His Excellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and our Prime Minister, Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, our entire Government and the people of the Federal Republic of Somalia.\nAt the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, for his excellent leadership. I wish him well in all his duties.\nI also pay a special tribute to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has truly championed development across the world in all its forms. In his two terms as Secretary-General we have seen a smooth transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals and the encouragement of greater, more innovative cross-sectoral partnerships for achieving progress for all. Whoever succeeds him as Secretary- General certainly has big shoes to fill.\nThe United Nations is indeed the foremost platform for nations of the world to come together as a community of nations to discuss and tackle the greatest challenges of our time. Those challenges are clear and require robust and coordinated international action to overcome. No one nation, no matter how powerful or resourceful, can alone address the grave challenges posed by climate change, terrorism, poverty and the large movements of refugees and migrants, as well as conflict. More important, no one nation today can claim that many of those great challenges are \u201cnot in my backyard; therefore, I do not need to act\u201d. In an age of globalization, interconnectivity and interdependence there is a duty incumbent upon us all to work even more closely together to protect and to advance the common interests of all humankind.\nThe Government of Somalia is truly committed to the Charter of the United Nations and the values of justice, peace and progress for all. Furthermore, our Government is immersed in laying the groundwork for the successful implementation of the crucial 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with a focus on peace and security, good governance and economic and social development through innovative partnerships at home. We are determined, in the interest of our mutual national and regional development and progress, to ensure that no one is left behind. Leaving people behind, especially the most vulnerable in our societies, would lead to incomplete progress and signify division and a lack of social solidarity among our peoples and within our nations.\nSomalia is a country that I dearly love, represent and serve. I am proud to say that all our partners, allies and friends across the world have recognized both the potential and the strategic value of our country for international security, trade and the promotion of democracy and good governance internationally. More important, during this week\u2019s high-level meeting on Somalia, held on the margins of the General Assembly meetings, the Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia and our key international partners exchanged views on the current progress and the remaining challenges in our country. I am glad to report that our partners have both recognized and pledged to continue supporting Somalia\u2019s fruitful journey towards democratization, stability and sustainable development.\nSomalia is taking bold and unprecedented steps towards a better future. That historic move towards progress and empowerment is driven by our resilient people, our determined central Government and all our valuable international partners. After nearly two decades of difficulties and instability, Somalia has negotiated a permanent turn towards progress and prosperity. We are writing a new chapter in our history, one that is characterized by hope, inclusive governance and development.\nI am proud to say that our Government, in cooperation with our people and valuable partners, has made tangible progress on the key issues of elections, the configuration of the State, security and economic development. Despite our fruitful cooperation with, and gratitude to, our international partners and friends, the Somali Government and the people take full responsibility for their own future in every way. Therefore, the Somali Government and the people \u2014 the ultimate stakeholders and beneficiaries of progress in the country \u2014 are stepping up to the many challenges so as to ensure that our country and people fulfil their potential and that of their beautiful and rich home.\nSomalia is winning the war against international terrorism at home and contributing to the creation of a safer world through cooperation on security with international partners across the world. With the support of our brave Somali national security services and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), we have militarily defeated the evil that is Al-Shabaab. Defeating international terrorism is a fundamental priority for Somalia, as those murderous criminals pose a genuine threat to us all and our way of life. The threat of terrorism is indeed international, as no country, regardless of its abilities, can insulate itself from that threat, given the new technologies and the fluidity of borders. Terrorism is truly a pointless evil without geography and without respect for the sanctity of human life. We can and must defeat it through partnerships across all international sectors. During the past four years, the Somali National Army and AMISOM have regained key towns and cities across Somalia. Today Al-Shabaab controls less than 10 per cent of the territory of the country. In recent months many of their key leaders have been eliminated. Others have defected, and their violent ideology is truly shunned by the Somali people. Somali national forces and AMISOM have proven that Al-Shabaab is vulnerable and divided, and can be defeated through coordinated military action.\nAs a result of the success of the joint operations of the Somali National Army and AMISOM, Al-Shabaab has turned to small-team, asymmetric warfare tactics in order to conduct terrorist attacks against soft targets in Somalia and, increasingly, in neighbouring countries. In response, our Government is working with our partners and neighbours to enhance security cooperation so as to enable us to respond to the threat, together and swiftly. Whereas before 2012 Al-Shabaab was engaged in open warfare with the Somali armed forces and AMISOM, today they are limited to undertaking infrequent, desperate and opportunistic suicide attacks on mosques, hotels, restaurants and businesses, as well as carrying out the assassination of innocent citizens.\nThat is the best evidence of their moral bankruptcy, ideological falsehood and diminished capabilities.\nThe Federal Republic of Somalia and our people are grateful to the troop-contributing countries in AMISOM for their support in stabilizing our country. We thank the brotherly States of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and Nigeria for contributing to the AMISOM forces and the police contingent. We fully recognize the sacrifices that their service personnel have made, and continue to make, in the service of Somalia and its people\u2019s future. I can assure the Assembly that their valour and distinguished service will never be forgotten. In fact, it is and will always be honoured in our national development.\nWhile we are grateful to AMISOM and our international partners for their diverse security-sector assistance, we fully understand that the only way we can truly achieve long-term stability and development, both in Somalia and across the region, is to have well- trained, equipped and funded Somali national security forces, which we hope to achieve ahead of the agreed deadline under which AMISOM will draw down in 2018. From all of that, it should be clear that the Somali Government and the people are committed to, and are leading the creation of, a safer Somalia, region and world.\nOn the matter of countering violent extremism, effectively countering the poisonous ideologies of hate that radicalize vulnerable young people is crucial in order to achieve permanent peace in Somalia and across the world. On 12 September His Excellency Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, President of Somalia, officially launched the national strategy and action plan for preventing and countering violent extremism for Somalia. Somalia is pleased that that inclusive process, which began more than 10 months ago, has successfully concluded with a comprehensive national strategy and action plan for preventing and countering violent extremism. The document is the result of a rigorous and inclusive process of dialogue and discussion with all the key stakeholders that lasted up to the point of its adoption by the Somali Government. The national strategy and action plan for preventing and countering violent extremism provides a holistic framework for addressing domestic and international security threats, including terrorism. With the completion of that vital strategy, Somalia has now fulfilled the call of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for each Member State to develop an action plan and strategy for preventing violent extremism.\nThe Federal Government of Somalia, in consultation with the federal states \u2014 which were all formed democratically starting in 2012, with one currently undergoing the process \u2014 has adopted a credible, transparent and inclusive electoral mechanism that we hope will pave the way for universal suffrage by 2020. The Somali people are excited by that positive move towards democracy, and the various electoral commissions, as well as the Somali people in general, are working tirelessly on the implementation of the electoral mechanism in line with the agreed time line.\nAs I speak, many aspiring parliamentarians are returning to their constituencies to win over voters so that they can represent them in the next Parliament. Billboards depicting presidential hopefuls seeking to win the hearts and minds of the Somali people line the roads and streets ahead of the election. That is a truly historic leap forward in terms of democratization in Somalia and provides clear evidence of the spirit and values of democracy taking shape in the country. The Federal Government of Somalia is determined to ensure a smooth, peaceful, inclusive and enhanced electoral process for a peaceful democratic transition in November.\nWe are also championing a 30 per cent quota for women in Parliament, as their representation and political participation is central to our national progress. Those actions most certainly constitute the first step towards the implementation of the 2020 political road map for universal suffrage in Somalia and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. In Somalia we are not short of ambition or self-confidence. We are committed to achieving our State-building goals with equity and good governance as a crucial baseline. We are also determined to leave no one behind in our march forward towards a better tomorrow.\nI am sure that everyone appreciates the difficulties of transitioning from conflict to inclusive governance and development. The Somali people and the Government are endeavouring to accomplish in just four years the kind of national transformation that took decades or centuries for many countries. Despite the enormity of the tasks ahead, we are committed and determined to succeed in achieving progress and prosperity for our people, the region and the world in general.\nTurning to economic development, the Federal Republic of Somalia fully acknowledges that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, to which we committed last year at the General Assembly, is central to our overall progress. Realistically achieving at least some of the Goals quickly and effectively, with a view to achieving the rest over the longer term, will ensure the success of our overall national and regional agenda for peace, sustainable development and prosperity. To that end, we have developed an inclusive, people-centred and implementable national development plan, which will act as a blueprint for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals within the set time frame.\nThroughout the United Nations, many key discussions have focused on funding development priorities across the world, especially the Sustainable Development Goals. In Somalia we fully understand and appreciate that the traditional aid model alone cannot ensure development and that it must be complemented by national contributions. In that spirit, and with the attainment of progress and prosperity for our people and region as a key driver, we have made investment promotion a central focus of Somali foreign and economic policy.\nSomalia is truly a rich nation, with the longest coast in Africa. Seventy per cent of its population is under 30 years of age. Our Government has passed one of the most competitive investment laws in the world, and we are ready to welcome and directly support all investors in each and every sector. In green energy, agriculture, infrastructure, telecommunications and the blue economy, Somalia can become a world leader and a profitable home for investors and new enterprises, with easy access to the African, Middle Eastern and Far Eastern markets. When the goal of investment is realized, most of the issues that we face in connection with illegal migration, large movements of refugees and poverty will be overcome in Somalia.\nRelying on partnerships and the great efforts of all, especially the Somali people themselves, Somalia has turned the corner toward stability and progress. Today shops are open, schools are full and our markets are busy with traders and customers. More important, our diaspora is returning to invest and build our key institutions, and we thank those Governments and organizations that have encouraged and continue to actively encourage such activities. In the past year alone, Somalia achieved many milestones. We most recently hosted the historic Extraordinary Summit of\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development Heads of State and Government in Mogadishu. We also successfully undertook our first national secondary school exams since the civil war \u2014 with the highest score received by a bright young lady. We are positively contributing to the stability, progress and development of our region, continent and the world through partnerships.\nThrough diverse partnerships, we are also working on getting Somali refugees to return home from Kenya voluntarily and with dignity so that they can actively participate in the efforts to rebuild their nation. Somalia, more than any other nation today, recognizes the importance of peacebuilding, which will help to avert the international refugee crisis. We appreciate the valuable contribution that refugees make to their new and old homes through remittances and cultural education, which is crucial for promoting tolerance. We are determined to save vulnerable lives at sea and reverse the brain drain holding our national progress hostage by striving to create at home the very opportunities that our people seek abroad.\nIt is impossible to forget the difficult past, but it is absolutely possible and necessary to dedicate oneself and the nation to a better future. That is what we are going to do in Somalia. In that regard, hope, confidence and progress characterize the new Somalia and all its people. There is no turning back now; we can only go forward together and in partnership with the region and the rest of the world. As we take the significant and necessary steps to confront the biggest challenges of our time as a community of nations, such as terrorism, poverty and large movements of refugees and migrants, we can assure everyone that Somalia and its people will play their part in the solutions.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to express our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General for all the sincere efforts he has made and continues to make to ensure the success of the peace process in Yemen and to put an end to the suffocating crises that plague Yemen. We thank his Special Envoy for Yemen, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, for all of his good efforts, which we praises and support. I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We wish him every success in fulfilling his noble mission.\nLast year from this rostrum I made a promise to restore Yemen\u2019s legitimacy (see A/70/PV.17). I came to New York from Aden, the interim capital of Yemen, months after the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against State institutions \u2014 which was led by the militias of the Houthis and former President Saleh -- had plunged Yemen into a meaningless war, tearing apart its social fabric and decimating its economic and financial capabilities and infrastructure.\nToday I address the Assembly while the State leadership at home is running the State from inside, despite all the difficulties. The Vice-President and the Government in its entirety in the liberated governates have aborted this destructive scheme led by Iran through mercenaries in Yemen. Today the coup forces are motivated by a vendetta against the people, pushing women and children to the fronts of death without any conscience or humanity.\nWe did not fire the first shot in Yemen\u2019s war. We were in Sana\u2019a before the coup. We have repeatedly called for an end to the wars, tragedies and conflicts that have been destroying Yemen over the past 50 years as a result of a corrupt Government, the selfish control of national wealth and power, heavy centralization and the neglect of most of the regions of the country.\nAll of those factors led to an increase in tensions and the eruption of the popular revolution against the former regime in February 2011 in order to bring about change. I called on everyone to build a cherished, democratic, civilian federal State in which human rights, the specifities of all the regions of Yemen, the dignity of women, the rights of children and the rights of all marginalized social groups are respected.\nThe Assembly may recall that I stood here four years ago (see A/67/PV.9) and spoke about the steps that we had taken and that we would take on the path towards a political transition of State power in the context of the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s initiative and on the basis of United Nations resolutions. I told the Assembly then that Iran was blocking all the measures that we were taking through a variety of actions and interventions. Today, we are suffering the consequences of its meaningless practices via the Houthi and former President Saleh\u2019s coup militias, whose actions have turned everything upside down.\nWe presented to the world a remarkable and unique experience, one unprecedented in the history of Yemen and the region, through the comprehensive national dialogue conference in which all parties participated.. It addressed the problems of Yemen in depth and drew up a road map for its future, which led to the drafting of a new federal civilian Constitution. We were on the cusp of building a new Yemen and completing the transitional phase when those militias carried out a coup against the State, its legitimacy and the national consensus.\nThe battles raging today are none of our doing. They were imposed on us by the coup by the Houthi/ Saleh militias\u2019 coalition, which turned against the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and Implementation Mechanism and the outcome of the dialogue. They rejected the national consensus and took over the capital and certain governorates. At a time when everyone else was embracing peace and national partnership, they were shooting everyone, besieging cities and killing innocent people in order to safeguard their interests for power and wealth and seizing the capacities of the country and plundering its resources.\nLet me stress that we are not advocating revenge. We do not seek to eliminate anyone from the Yemeni landscape. Rather, we extend our hands to all to build a new Yemen. Despite the extensive damage caused by the coup scheme on the political, social, economic and cultural fronts, we continue to see the rebels as a Yemeni group that must return to reason. We do not take away their right to a future.\nWe are still yearning for a life in dignity and safety for all Yemenis. Our project is one of life, construction, hope and stability for the new Federation of Yemen. It is a project for all Yeminis, who painstakingly drafted its parameters in the national dialogue and its outcome. It calls for a federal State founded on justice and the equitable distribution of power and wealth. More than once we have urged them to demonstrate their loyalty to their homeland, and we have called on them to dissociate themselves from the State that did not bring anything to Yemen except destruction and fuel for wars.\nThe peace we aspire to cannot accept control by militias and sectarian gangs of the State\u2019s capacities, over medium and heavy weapons and missles that target the security and stability of Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf region. Our endeavours for peace can never overshadow the great sacrifices made by our people and their noble objectives. Any appropriate solutions should aim to end the coup and all its consequences, first and foremost by making sure the armed militias withdraw, surrender their weapons and give up the institutions they are controlling. Afterward, we should complete the political process by endorsing the new draft Constitution and hold general elections.\nTherefore, we welcomed and cooperated with all sincere efforts that the United Nations made, as well as with all other ideas contributed to bring about peace. But they were rejected by the party involved in the coup, which refused to entertain them in a positive spirit.\nWe want to tell the world in very clear terms that extremism and sectarian terrorism sponsored by Iran in the region have bred and will continue to breed counter-extremism that feeds on terrorism. Brutality and terrorism, as demonstrated by those involved in the coup against the Yemeni people, feed and nourish the seeds of terrorism. We are all suffering from terrorism. This is why, on behalf of all Yemenis, I declare our full commitment to relentlessly combating terrorism. But let me stress that we cannot defeat terrorism in Yemen without tackling its root causes, the most important of which is the extremism and vindictive acts of terrorism by the Houthi/Saleh militas.\nThe political vacuum caused by the war, and the economic depression triggered by the black-market policies that impoverished the State and plundered its resources, were executed by the coup militias from the very beginning. They all led to a situation of stark poverty that is being exploited by terrorist groups to enlist people, recruit children, stockpile weapons and take control of cities. Unless we take effective measures to address those root causes, Yemen and the entire region will continue to suffer.\nFor the Yemenis, the criminal acts perpetrated by the militias, including the systematic killing of civilians, children and the elderly, especially in Taiz Governorate, the abductions and forced disappearances, the besieged cities, and the suppression of public freedoms of the Yemeni people are acts of terrorism on a par with those perpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Da\u2019esh, Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. The terrorism inflicted on the Yemeni people at the hands of the coup militias is similar to what they suffered at the hands of Da\u2019esh and Al-Qaida. The Yemeni people are the only people who are affected by the Yemini version of Da\u2019esh, Al-Qaida and Hezbollah. The world should understand the Yemeni people\u2019s priorities to attain freedom and fighti all terrorist groups, with their different forms and categories. The fait accompli policy when dealing with extremists constitutes a dangerous international precedent because it confers legitimacy on the violent and terrorist rebel groups that are forcibly imposing their will on the people.\nThe militias involved in the coup diverted the mandate of the Central Bank of Yemen from its main mission at a time when the economy of Yemen was on the brink of collapse, turning it into a tool of war against the Yemeni people. The militias used the resources of the Central Bank to fund the war, undermining their independence, systematically plundering their assets and devaluing the local currency with the aim of exhausting our cash reserves. Those are irresponsible economic policies. We therefore decided to move the Central Bank to the interim economic capital, Aden, to save what could still be saved and to prevent the total depletion of the reserves.\nNo one will benefit from this situation except terrorists, violent groups and the black-market trade networks. We wish to stress to the whole world that we took that step only after exercising considerable patience. Finally, our patience ran out after we assessed the dangers inherent in allowing the Bank to continue to be controlled by irresponsible militias that work for the profit of their leaders and are bent on impoverishing the people and the State institutions. The motivating idea was to end the war by restricting the flow of funds to those militias. In that connection, we call on the free world and its financial institutions to support and stand by us and to respond to these measures to save the Yemeni economy and to prevent the militias from controlling the future of Yemen.\nThe situation in the wake of the destructive war imposed on our people is a result of the plundering of the State\u2019s resources, the manipulation of the Central Bank\u2019s assets, the erosion of foreign currency reserves, the non-use of the local currency and the promotion of trade war, black-market practices and smuggling by the militias. These factors augur dangerous times for Yemen. We will not be able to pay the salaries of civil servants, which will exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe at hand. The situation requires action and assistance by the international community to support the Government of Yemen in its efforts to generate economic recovery and reconstruction. Let me stress that the Central Bank of Yemen remains fully committed to fulfilling its national and international obligations.\nNotwithstanding the declarations of support every year, the strategic humanitarian plan for Yemen devised by the United Nations covers only a small portion of the growing essential needs that people are experiencing in the catastrophically difficult situation in Yemen. I take this opportunity to renew my call on all donor countries to fulfil their pledges and to provide more assistance in order to alleviate the suffering of Yemen. The Government of the Republic of Yemen wants to ensure that urgent humanitarian aid is delivered to all who are in need of it in all governates of Yemen, without exception. In that regard, I commend the great effort mounted by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre and the Gulf Cooperation Council relief and humanitarian organizations.\nThe Yemen that we aspire to build \u2014 the Yemen that will emerge from the ruins of the unjust war imposed on it by the Houthi/Saleh militias \u2014 will be better integrated into its immediate regional surroundings. It will be cognizant of its strategic and geopolitical position in the Arabian peninsula and the Gulf.\nOn this occasion I reiterate our thanks and gratitude to my brother King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as to the President and the Government of the United Arab Emirates and to all our kin in the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab Coalition for the restoration of legitimacy in Yemen.\nThree days from now, our great Yemeni people will celebrate the anniversary of the landmark Yemeni revolution of 26 September 1962, which declared Yemen a democratic republic. We recall with pride the glorious achievements of Yemen and the struggle of our Yemeni heroes. Allow me, from this rostrum, to stress to our people that the path of sacrifices charted by Yemenis in their struggle against backwardness and the Imamate system of government is being complemented today by the sacrifices of new heroes, who are defending the revolution and the Republic. We stand behind the overwhelming majority of Yemenis until victory and until we defeat the legions of the Imamate system and its heirs -- the former regime and its new version led by the treacherous Houthi/Saleh alliance \u2014 and halt their endeavours to establish a racist, theocratic system of government based on the \u201crule by the Islamic jurist\u201d. We reaffirm to our people that victory has never been closer.\nAllow me to address our people from this rostrum as we celebrate the glorious anniversary of the revolution. To our Yemeni people who have suffered injustice, bereavement, displacement, fleeing, disappearance, killings and hunger, our dear and generous people, I say with a great deal of confidence that their sacrifices will not be in vain, that their aspirations will be fulfilled. We are bound to be victorious, and, God willing, we will carry out our just project. We will extract Yemen from the claws of Iran. We will raise the Yemeni flag over our precious national soil, every square foot of it, and we will lay the foundation for a just federal State. All along, we have been and we will continue to be pioneers of peace and security, advocates of love and harmony, advocates of dialogue and consultation.\nThe current situation truly pains me; it is heartbreaking for any Yemeni to see blood shed anywhere. I am responsible for all of Yemeni territory and people, from one end of the country to the other. Nothing is in my heart except the concerns of my people, my homeland and my desire to see my country enjoy prosperity and peace. We will continue to deal positively and patiently with all. We will make all necessary sacrifices in order to restore social peace and recover our national cohesion in accordance with our constitutional and moral responsibility vis-a-vis the suffering of our people in all parts of the country.\nI feel ashamed that the Yemeni people have had to endure the persistent failures of successive Yemeni Governments over the past 50 years. In both the north and south of Yemen, they were unable to meet the five basic necessities of our people: water, health care, education, electricity and road networks. But there is no point in crying over a bygone era and its Governments. Have our people not suffered enough death and destruction? Have the authors of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat \u2014 the Houthi/Saleh militias \u2014 not heard the humanitarian calls from this international forum to cooperate with the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy to Yemen in order to implement what we have agreed upon? I refer to the established terms of reference of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the national dialogue, the relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly resolution 2216 (2015), and the outcome of the peace talks in Kuwait.\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to express our thanks and gratitude to His Royal Highness Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, and our brother people of Kuwait.\nIn conclusion, I wish to draw attention to the foremost issue of a just solution regarding the question of Palestine and its capital -- the Holy City of Jerusalem.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to join my colleagues in expressing my country\u2019s deepest gratitude and appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his sterling work.\nThis seventy-first session of the General Assembly is marked primarily by the high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants. The outcome document of this meeting, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), will spur us to work further to address the enormous movement of people, the likes of which we have not seen since the Second World War.\nLast year, this gathering considered that migration had reached crisis levels. Today, we are increasingly realizing that this phenomenon is set to become a new normal that needs to be managed. Despite the difficult debates, discussions, stumbling blocks and widely divergent viewpoints, it is encouraging to see how far we have come and how much we have found that truly unites us, underpinned by the most fundamental principles of saving lives and upholding human dignity. Nevertheless, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I must confess I am still concerned that all the soft words we have heard will be undermined by hard facts. Despite this, we owe it to everyone to give it a try.\nWe need to respond to this challenge, not with fear, not with dread, not by enclosing ourselves within walls, but with tenacity, conviction and compassion. This is what drives my country, time and again, to push for migration to be high on our agenda. Together with our European partners, and sometimes on our own, or almost, Malta has been working tirelessly to address the common concerns and challenges being presented. In that respect, our international efforts to address migrant smuggling and human trafficking through measures aimed at disrupting the business models of criminals, who harbour a total disregard for human life and profit from other people\u2019s tragedies, are key. Though commendable, these efforts need to be stepped up. Information-sharing, improved implementation of national enforcement policies and stronger penalties to punish smugglers are essential dimensions of an effective response to this challenge.\nI believe people-smugglers are in the same category as the worst type of criminals and must be treated as such. We should seriously consider a structure where traffickers are brought to justice before an international tribunal in order to drive home the message that we are looking at this tragedy not only from the humanitarian angle, which is appropriate, but also from the security perspective, and that profiting from human trafficking does not pay.\nMalta believes that there is no such thing as a unilateral solution to migration. A global perspective is required. Closer cooperation among the countries of origin, transit and destination is essential and needed. This was the focus of the Valletta summit on migration, which we were proud to have host lasted November in Malta, when European and African leaders met to see what they can do together and for one another.\nHaving just participated in the General Assembly high-level summit, I am immensely pleased and encouraged to see that the New York Declaration and the spirit of the Valletta summit live on, at least in words and in intentions. Unfortunately, most follow- up actions still need to be implemented. As I have said previously, steps need to be taken now, especially by those countries that bear the moral responsibility for mass movements, either through their actions or their inaction.\nThe Somali-British poet Warsan Shire writes in her poem entitled \u201cHome\u201d that\n\u201cno one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land\u201d.\nMy country\u2019s vision is for a safe Mediterranean region that offers peace, wealth, stability and work.\nThe situation in the Middle East has a huge bearing on that of our region and of the entire world. It pains me to dwell on the fact that we are still absolutely nowhere near a solution in the context of the Middle East peace process. Malta is deeply concerned about the lack of progress towards a just and lasting peace in the region.\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. We call on all parties to change the political, security and economic structures, including the end of the closure and a full opening of the crossing points to assist Palestinians in Gaza in rebuilding their lives. On the other hand, Malta continues to believe that the State of Israel\u2019s legitimate right to exist must not be called into question. We believe that Israelis have the right to live in peace within secure borders. With a clear view on the rights of the Israelis and Palestinians, my country continues to back initiatives aimed at rekindling the prospects for peace talks and for keeping the two- State solution alive. But in doing so we acknowledge that there is a need to create the right conditions for rebuilding trust as a means of bringing the two parties back to the negotiating table. To achieve this, both sides must take bold steps and refrain from all actions that undermine progress in the resumed peace talks. We support international efforts aimed at creating new dynamics around the peace process that would build upon other efforts towards a lasting solution, including the Arab Peace Initiative and the French initiative. We hope that there will be the right traction to create the conditions for a lasting and durable solution.\nIn our most immediate neighbourhood, Malta has supported, and will continue to support, its neighbour Tunisia towards stability and democracy. Despite facing serious challenges, Tunisia is gradually emerging as the first, albeit fragile, Arab democracy. But for it to succeed, it is important that the international community not abandon Tunisia at this critical juncture.\nYet while Tunisia offers hope, the overall picture in Libya continues to be bleak. I am afraid that I am one of the few speakers to have mentioned Libya. I must note the important, incremental positive developments. We have managed to come a considerable way since last December, and Malta commends and continues to support the hard work of the United Nations and the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representatives, including their unrelenting efforts and perseverance to improve the political setting for a stable and democratic Libya. We also welcome the recent adoption of resolution 2298 (2016), allowing for the destruction of the chemical weapons present in the country. That is a commendable effort aimed at reducing the risk of these weapons fall ing into the hands of extremists.\nHowever, despite this progress, the situation remains fragile. The Libyan population needs a concretely functioning Government that addresses their basic needs \u2014 proper medication, food security and education. As neighbours, we stand by the Libyan people\u2019s efforts to transform their country into a safe, democratic and unified State, with a reconciled people, where State authority and the rule of law are restored. I am certain that this is the dream of our Libyan friends themselves. We reiterate the need to remain supportive of the Libyan Peace Accord and the Presidency Council and to respect Libyan sovereignty and take into account Libyan ownership.\nThis has been a year of atrocious terrorist acts against innocent victims. Bystanders \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 have been killed while going about their daily lives, going to work, taking a stroll, eating with family and praying. This year has seen a rise in the spread of a culture of violence and death that is spanning continents and hurting people of every gender, race and creed. No religion or belief in discrimination can ever be a defensible cause for maiming, terrorizing or killing others.\nA global society that is truly determined to counter all facets of terrorism must rise above prescriptive pronouncements and take action. In that regard, Malta believes that the United Nations is central to the global fight against terrorism. As host to the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, Malta believes that the most effective way to counter terrorism is by empowering the rule of law and strengthening the judiciary in States where terrorist activity is gaining ground. This is what this centre is doing, without much fanfare, each and every day.\nAll of these aspects are priority areas for Malta, which is currently Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth of Nations and is looking forward to holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of next year. As we near this milestone in our political history, Malta continues to successfully broaden its foreign-policy focus. While our neighbourhood will naturally remain among the leading priorities for the months and years to come, our country seeks to intensify its outreach to other regions and countries that present potential for further exchanges. The overriding driving force of our global perspective is oriented towards dialogue and mutual understanding \u2014 a vocation to which Malta has genuinely adhered for decades.\nAs I have suggested previously, Malta is deeply committed to Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and cooperation, inspired by our long-lasting policy, forged by former Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, based on the principle that there can be no peace and security in Europe without peace and security in the Mediterranean. We believe that this principle was never more true than today and that it can be broadened to say that there can be no peace and security, not just in Europe but in the world, without peace and security in the Mediterranean. This vision will be a primary driving force behind Malta\u2019s presidency of the Council of the European Union. Countries bordering the southern Mediterranean shores are facing serious challenges, ranging from conflict to terrorism to extremism and radicalization. These are all challenges that cannot be addressed by individual countries and which require concerted resolve and action.\nApart from ensuring ownership of this cause by all stakeholders in the region, Malta will also promote the fostering of better synergies among regional Mediterranean mechanisms \u2014 including the Five+Five, the Union for the Mediterranean and the Anna Lindh Foundation \u2014 to address threats and achieve shared goals. Furthermore, the Maltese presidency of the European Council will endeavour to continue strengthening relations with the League of Arab States with the aim of consolidating institutions and achieving better relations. We will also continue to actively support the revitalization of relations with the Gulf States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which would also serve as another opportunity to step up multilevel regional cooperation with the European Union.\nOver the past 70 years, the United Nations has strived to work together to achieve peace, security, development and human rights. In spite of the atrocities we have witnessed in past years, we must continue to hold onto these principles. We must not allow fear to be the driving, and at times paralysing, force. We must continue to keep in mind the larger picture and recognize that our diversity is our strength, that to understand each other fortifies our progress and that one people\u2019s concerns are collectively our concerns. Malta will continue to play its part within the Organization to contribute, support and advance its initiatives and to foster new ones for the common good.\n"

        "file_text": "A year ago, as I stood at this rostrum (A/70/PV.21), large areas of Iraqi territory were occupied by the terrorist organization Da\u2019esh. Today, as we stand here again, we are able to declare before the General Assembly that Iraq is being liberated and that Iraqis have been able to free most of their land and towns, thanks to their unity and determination. Currently we are in the process of liberating Ninawa, the last province controlled by Da\u2019esh, where we have regained major areas. We shall complete its liberation by the end of the year.\nLet me report that today our heroic forces liberated the city of Al-Sharqat in Salahaddin province and other neighbouring areas and major towns. That is testimony to the great confidence and capabilities of our forces, who enjoy the full support of the local residents. I commend all of the valiant soldiers who are working to liberate peaceful Iraq from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We have declared 2016 as a year of liberation and victory. Our fundamental goal is to liberate our people and the land and to save the civilians from ISIL, which has ruined all aspects of life and destroyed archaeological monuments of the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia.\nAssisted by our friends in the international community, we have started to implement programmes for the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to the liberated areas. In that context, we developed an integrated programme for stabilization and the provision of services, particularly water, electricity, schools and hospitals. We call on the international community to provide further support for sheltering and returning IDPs, especially in the light of the forthcoming battle to fully liberate Ninawa and the anticipated increase in the number of displaced persons. We thank all those who have stood beside our people in the face of economic and security challenges, and we look forward to further support and collaboration.\nWe would commend the United Nations system for providing humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq and for its role in addressing IDP issues. We applaud the support extended by the States of the international coalition aimed at tackling terrorism, as well as of friendly countries. We commend the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations for supporting the plans and efforts of the Iraqi Government to reform the Iraqi economy, overcome the financial crisis and fight corruption in all its forms. We greatly appreciate the constructive position of the Group of Seven States and thank the donors conference for the reconstruction of Iraq recently held in Washington, D.C.\nIn the area of economic and financial reforms, the Government implemented an ambitious reform programme to reduce government expenditure, despite having to spend more to support the war against terrorism. As part of its administrative reforms, the Government initiated the restructuring of many State institutions. It prioritized citizens\u2019 services by streamlining procedures, removing many obstacles, simplifying the procedures to deal with citizens\u2019 affairs and removing impediments to investment. The Government also strengthened procedures for creating private-sector partnerships and had a good measure of success in that regard.\nAs for fighting corruption, we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Development Programme to benefit from international expertise to aid Iraq in capacity-building to fight corruption. The past few weeks have seen practical steps in that regard. We look forward to making more progress in fighting terrorism and bringing the perpetrators to justice.\nWe look forward to the day when Iraq and the whole region are free of the criminal acts perpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). But we will be satisfied only when the whole world becomes free from terrorism that threatens our peoples and nations. This requires serious collaboration to contain terrorism, cut off its ideological and financial resources and dismantle its networks and recruitment hubs all over the world. Without such cooperation, terrorism will spread everywhere, giving rise to increased numbers of refugees fleeing conflict areas. Those numbers have already reached unprecedentedly high levels.\nWe assure Member States that ISIL is indisputably a greater enemy of Islam than of other faiths. ISIL has murdered thousands of Muslims, wrought destruction and spread its evil to many Arab and Islamic States. It has been active in capitals and cities worldwide \u2014 killing and terrorizing civilians in France, Belgium, Germany, the United States of America, Russia and elsewhere.\nWe have no choice but to cooperate to win the war against these evil terrorists. We deem any victory achieved against ISIL anywhere in the world to be a global triumph.\nThe danger of the formation of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida or Da\u2019esh/ISIL will not end until we address the problem of their radical ideology. These backward groups rely on sectarian segregation and hostility towards all other faiths and beliefs, and their ideology is fuelled by a short-sighted vision that has hindered national development opportunities. If we are to combat this pernicious scourge, which has spread among some young people and exploited their feelings of disaffection and despair, countries and organizations must take a determined stand. They must review the programmes and curriculums of educational institutions and address feelings of frustration, with a view to absorbing disaffected young people into the mainstream of society. Any attempts by such terrorist organizations to re-establish themselves in future must be pre-empted.\nISIL, which falsely claims that it is defending Sunnis, has so far killed Shiites, Sunnis, Christians, Yazidis, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens, and Shabak as well. Their atrocities have been directed at the entire ethnic spectrum of Iraq and involved takfir, displacement, female enslavement, genocide and the destruction of antiquities, mosques and churches. Such heinous crimes were perpetrated against cities, such as Amerly, Sinjar, Taza, Anbar, Mosul, Salahuddin and Diyala, and against the victims of the Camp Speicher massacre, not to mention the cowardly terrorist attacks on civilians in the districts of Baghdad and the rest of Iraq\u2019s provinces.\nIraq encountered two external factors that affected stability and economic and social growth. Apart from terrorism, we have had to face the global decline in oil prices, which caused a budget loss amounting to 70 per cent of revenues, in addition to the burden of increased military and security expenditures to free Iraqi cities from terrorism and to rebuild them. It was only natural that this would negatively impact development, investment and reconstruction plans. Despite all these daunting challenges, we continued to implement our comprehensive reform programme and to combat the corruption that corrodes our State agencies and social institutions. From the outset, we realized that this reform programme would be no less difficult and dangerous than tackling terrorism. However, we are determined that it will be implemented despite all the challenges. We are confident that we can win the battle of reforms, just as we won the battle to liberate our lands.\nWe and our people stand together shoulder to shoulder in our fight against terrorism and corruption. We are working together to build a State that is based on peaceful coexistence and respect for religious, ideological and sectarian diversity, guided by the values and principles of justice and equality. Each Iraqi contributes to the victory achieved in the fight against ISIL. It is a national and non-conventional, existential battle, involving all the Iraqi people. Our armed forces, federal and local police, the popular mobilization forces, the tribal mobilization forces and the Peshmerga forces represent all religions, ethnicities and sects; they share one goal, namely, to defend our homeland and its sacred values. Our religious leader, His Eminence the Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Sistani, supported this defence. His historic fatwa led to a broad-based mobilization of the entire Iraqi people, and religious leaders and clergy of all religious creeds in Iraq widely embraced and supported the fatwa.\nIraq is keen to participate alongside all countries in advancing development efforts and attaining the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 combating poverty and discrimination, protecting the environment, enhancing child-care programmes and improving standards of health and education. Our intent is to create an environment that promotes freedom, human rights, equality and the vitally important participation of women in the State and society.\nWe call on nations worldwide to commit to implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions on preventing support to, financing or arming terrorist groups that kill civilians, as well as General Assembly resolutions on safeguarding Iraq\u2019s cultural heritage. Thanks to a cooperative effort between Iraq and UNESCO, the wetland areas of southern Iraq have now been added to the list of World Heritage sites. We are also keen to meet the inclusion requirements for the rest of the cultural sites and treasures of Iraq\u2019s ancient civilization.\nWe take this opportunity to call on the international community to exert efforts to end conflicts, prevent wars, support peace and security, encourage development opportunities and reject policies involving interference in the internal affairs of other States. Such policies result in more suffering among our peoples and deeper divisions in our region, which continues to be racked by internal wars and external interventions that have made our civilian populations ever more miserable.\nWe appeal to the international community to support and respect Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and to demand that Turkey withdraw its forces from our territory, where their continued presence, despite the fact that Iraqis have rejected it, is an obstacle to our efforts to liberate Ninawa.\nThe Iraqi Government is working hard to help the Iraqi people live in peaceful coexistence with one another and to treat all citizens equally on a basis of good citizenship, regardless of their religion, sect or ethnicity. We would like to reiterate our gratitude to the United Nations and our friends for their support to Iraq and the Iraqi people through their various humanitarian programmes aimed at caring for displaced people and refugees. We also thank them for their support of the Iraqi Government\u2019s efforts to achieve security and stability and the reforms and economic development that our people aspire to.\nWe would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the Assembly at its seventy-first session. We would also like to thank Mr. Lykketoft for his leadership at the seventieth session, and to warmly congratulate the Secretary-General on the forthcoming conclusion of his term of office at the end of this year. We pay tribute to him for his excellent stewardship of the United Nations. He has visited Iraq many times, and we thank him for his support of our development plans.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to extend our sincere congratulations to the President and his country, the Republic of Fiji, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and to assure him of my country\u2019s full cooperation as he shoulders a great responsibility. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his efforts and his success in presiding over the discussions of the previous session.\nWe would also like to sincerely thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate will expire at the end of the year. He has spent almost a decade at the helm of the Organization and has worked diligently and honestly to promote international peace and security. He has played a prominent role in enhancing the performance of the organs of the United Nations and in achieving major milestones, such as the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and the signing of the global agreement on climate change. We would like to wish His Excellency every success in his future endeavours and look forward to his continued service to the causes of security, peace and development.\nAt this new session of the General Assembly, we convene under the theme \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d amid unprecedented security and economic challenges. That will require greater coordination and the doubling of our efforts to overcome such challenges, limit their impact and address their root causes. In that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the two historic agreements on climate change, signed by Kuwait at this very rostrum in April, and the comprehensive and inclusive 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, whose Goals we hope will be achieved. We pledge to make every effort to contribute effectively within the framework of an international partnership to fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals over the next 14 years.\nAs we stand in support of the developing countries and the least developed countries, the State of Kuwait firmly believes that countries afflicted by natural disasters and those affected by the scourge of war need to be assisted. That should be done in a manner ensuring the enhancement of the relations Kuwait has had with the peoples and countries of the world since it attained its independence in 1961. It has set out a consistent approach according to which it stands by the developing and least developed countries. Kuwait has attained a prestigious standing among donors providing humanitarian assistance as a consequence of its initiatives and continued response to the appeals launched by the United Nations and its specialized agencies to alleviate the suffering of affected peoples and countries throughout the world, thereby helping them cope with their crises.\nKuwait is also eager to achieve a world in which justice and equality prevail in support of human values and where the haves unconditionally provide for the deserving have-nots. In that regard, I would like to reiterate Kuwait\u2019s intention to honour all its pledges made at international conferences.\nKuwait is proud to occupy first place in the provision of humanitarian assistance as a ratio of its gross domestic income, according to United Nations statistics for 2015. Kuwait takes pride in such recognition, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development continues to play a pioneering role in providing soft loans and grants, representing approximately $20 billion, to fund development programmes, which have benefited 105 countries in various parts of the world.\nConsistently adhering to the noble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the State of Kuwait has worked towards achieving and laying down the foundations of security and stability in our region through participating in all efforts that contribute to the promotion of international peace and security. In that connection, I would like to refer to the crisis in Yemen and to renew our support for the political solution brokered by the United Nations in accordance with the outcome of the national dialogue, the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its implementation mechanism, and Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). The State of Kuwait hosted the Yemeni peace talks under the auspices of the United Nations from April to August in order to restore security and stability in Yemen while preserving its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nWe take this opportunity to renew our praise of and support for the efforts undertaken by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmad, and call upon him to intensify those efforts for the prompt resumption of dialogue between the Yemeni parties under the aegis of the United Nations.\nIn Syria, we are following with concern the ongoing crisis, which is now entering its sixth year, and the worsening conditions throughout the country. The deteriorating humanitarian situation has displaced 13 million Syrians within and beyond the country\u2019s borders, making the Syrian people the largest refugee community in the world. The number of those who have been killed now exceeds 250,000. We strongly condemn the intentional targeting of residential areas and civil and medical facilities, indiscriminate bombing, and the use of barrel bombs and internationally banned weapons. We also demand that all those responsible for perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity be brought to justice within the international justice system.\nDriven by its desire to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, the State of Kuwait has hosted three international pledging conferences to support humanitarian efforts in Syria. Pledges totalled more than $7 billion, of which my country contributed $1.3 billion. The largest share of those pledges has been allotted to United Nations specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations dealing with humanitarian affairs. That effort complements Kuwait\u2019s participation as co-host of the fourth Supporting Syria and the Region conference, held in London early this year.\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its support for United Nations and other international efforts aimed at reaching a political solution in Syria in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which charted a clear path for the political solution based on the 2012 Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/522, annex) and the two Vienna communiqu\u00e9s. I also commend the efforts of the United States of America and the Russian Federation to reach a ceasefire that would pave the way for political talks among the Syrian parties to reach a settlement that would preserve the sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and independence of Syria, realizing the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the brotherly Syrian people.\nInternational efforts have been carried out to combat the phenomena of terrorism, extremism and acts of violence, which have been on the rise as a new international reality because of the ongoing crises in the region, for which no permanent solution is in sight. It is therefore incumbent upon us to recognize that combating these odious phenomena is an international responsibility and that no single country by itself, despite its every effort, can confront or eliminate them. It is also morally impermissible to link the phenomena to any nationality, religion or civilization.\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its principled and firm position in condemning terrorist acts in all their forms and manifestations, as well as its total rejection of all acts of violence and extremism that not only run counter to international laws and norms, but also to the teachings of the true tenets of Islam, all other divine religions, and cultural and human values. In that context, the State of Kuwait is actively contributing to combating terrorism by providing support and backing to the international coalition established to combat what is known as the Da\u2019esh terrorist group in Iraq.\nWe reiterate our position to stand by and support the Government of Iraq, and we commend its achievements in combating terrorism and confronting Da\u2019esh. We emphasize our support for its measures and actions to maintain its own security, stability and territorial integrity.\nTurning to the situation Libya, which is a source of grave concern, the State of Kuwait welcomes the decision of the Presidential Council to form the Government of National Accord. Kuwait considers it an important step towards the implementation of the provisions of the Libyan Political Agreement, and one that we hope will assist our Libyan brothers in overcoming the status quo in a manner that preserves the unity and independence of Libya and the prosperity of its people.\nThe failure of the international community to find a permanent and comprehensive solution to the conflict in the Middle East threatens peace and security in the region more than ever as a result of the oppressive practices of the Israeli occupation forces and Israel\u2019s consistent, excessive and unjustifiable use of force against the Palestinian people in blatant and clear-cut violation of resolutions of international legitimacy and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.\nThe persistence of the Israeli occupation authority in pursuing aggressive practices and policies against the Palestinian people regrettably emanates from a firm conviction that Israel is immune from any international accountability, exempt from any prosecution and protected from any criticism or condemnation by international organizations. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the Security Council to carry out its responsibilities and pressure Israel to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such implementation would lead to the Palestinian people\u2019s attaining their legitimate political rights and their own independent State with their own territory. East Jerusalem would be its capital and its borders would be those of 4 June 1967, in accordance with the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative.\nIn support of Palestine, the State of Kuwait is currently working on hosting an international conference on the suffering of Palestinian children, which will shed light on Israel\u2019s serious and persistent violations of international conventions and norms relative to the rights of the child. In this connection, I wish to praise the initiative of the friendly French Republic and its efforts to push the Middle East peace process forward. The joint communiqu\u00e9 of 3 June 2016 on the subject of an international conference reflects its interest in launching a new process with a view to reaching a just and comprehensive solution in the region.\nAs regards the Islamic Republic of Iran, the State of Kuwait, along with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, looks forward to relations of friendship and cooperation with Iran permeated with understanding and mutual respect. We also wish to emphasize the need to create appropriate conditions for constructive dialogue to take place in conformity with the rules and norms of international law relating to the principles of good-neighbourly relations, respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs, and refraining from any practices that contravene international conventions and norms that threaten the security and stability of the region. Additionally, the occupation of the three Emirate islands must end and the concerns of our sister nation, the United Arab Emirates, must be addressed and receive a solution, through either direct negotiation or resort to the International Court of Justice.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to refer to the candidature of the State of Kuwait for membership in the Security Council for the period 2018-2019. I would like to avail myself of the opportunity to extend my thanks to all the member States of the Asia and Pacific Group in New York, which endorsed Kuwait\u2019s candidature last month. We look forward to the support of all States Members of the United Nations in the elections that will be held in June next year. As I have emphasized, my country is committed to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Being a small, peace-loving country, Kuwait bases its relations with others on the principles of respect for sovereignty and independence, good-neighbourly relations and non-interference in their internal affairs. We look forward to facilitating the process of finding solutions by consensus. Peace be upon you.\n"

        "file_text": "Peace and security, human rights and development are the pillars of the United Nations \u2014 a founding promise to the world that this Organization was created to safeguard. Yet our world today is anything but peaceful and secure; it is marred by injustice, inequality and intolerance, each of which erodes the foundations of human society. We are witnessing human suffering on an unprecedented scale, suffering that reaches far beyond national boundaries and capacities to deal with it. Poverty, hunger, disease, natural disasters and climate change afflict millions of our fellow human beings. Many States and societies are trapped in protracted conflicts, with cycles of violence claiming countless victims.\nWe are facing the worst forced displacement crisis since the Second World War. Some 60 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of wars, persecution and human-rights violations. They are scattered around the world with their livelihoods and communities shattered to pieces and their nations and cultures torn apart. Robbed of their dignity and living in despair in refugee camps, they are compelled to seek a better future on the borders of other countries. They are not faceless statistics, but human beings with every right to a future free of violence and a future full of hope and opportunity. Their tragedy is our tragedy; their future is our future.\nThis crisis requires not only a humanitarian response but a sustainable political solution. It requires stronger political leadership and resolve, as well as a rethinking of policy, operational and financing strategies at national, regional and international levels. However, all too often, narrow national interests impede the formulation of such joint responses. When crises, such as the current refugee and migrant crisis in the Middle East and in Europe, transcend borders we must look at the big picture \u2014 not merely from the standpoint of national interests \u2014 because the consequences of our actions and omissions resonate beyond our borders.\nAs a country that had hundreds of thousands of its citizens suffer the plight of being forced out of their homes, Bosnia and Herzegovina attaches great significance to addressing this challenge. We recognize the importance and timely organization of the summit for refugees and migrants, and we welcome the adoption of the outcome document (resolution 71/1) that is clearly linked to the 2030 Agenda. We hope that the commitments made by Member States at that meeting will have meaningful impact on the ground. In the 2030 Agenda, we pledged to ensure that no one is left behind and committed to empowering the most vulnerable.\nBosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the 2030 Agenda. As a newly elected member of the Economic and Social Council, we will play an active role in the implementation of this transformative blueprint for change. Our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will depend on the availability of support for national implementation \u2014 primarily from the revised and improved Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, which must be a true global platform for the exchange of best practices in the fields of finance, trade, technology and capacity- building among Member States. We support the Global Mechanism and the monitoring of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, which will outline critical milestones towards a coherent and inclusive follow-up and review of the Agenda at the global level.\nThe 2030 Agenda requires us to achieve transformation not only for the sake of the people but also for the sake of the planet. Our development must not come at the expense of our habitat. Unless we urgently take coordinated global action to reverse existing patterns of environmental degradation and climate change, we risk endangering a desired future for generations to come. Fulfilling the commitments of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is critical to protecting development outcomes and adapting to the consequences of natural disasters and climate change through risk-informed development. Bosnia and Herzegovina is already implementing its Climate Change Adaptation and Low-Emission Development Strategy, with the aim of becoming a viable and advanced green economy by 2025.\nBut we need to stay alert. The 2030 Agenda is not the answer to all our problems. There is always room for inequality and injustice to thrive if our approach, acceptance and implementation are not cohesive and unified. What we make of the 2030 Agenda and how we build upon it will determine its results in improving equal opportunity for all people.\nHuman rights are at the heart of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, from eradicating poverty to reducing inequality and promoting inclusive societies. As we start to bring people in from the margins, we must strive to put human rights at the centre of our actions, as they are the most powerful driving forces of peace and development. The SDGs are the gold standard we are committed to upholding so that our people can enjoy dignity, freedom and equality. They are a moral and legal framework that empowers people everywhere to fight injustice anywhere.\nWe are deeply concerned about the erosion of world peace and security caused by new and protracted conflicts, especially in the Middle East. The Israeli- Palestinian conflict, which has lasted for over 60 years, has been the primary and constant source of instability in the Middle East. A new impetus for negotiations is urgently needed. We strongly support efforts to hold a peace conference that would bring a lasting and just resolution to this conflict, based on the principles of international law and reaching a consensus on the peaceful coexistence of two independent States.\nInternational peace and stability are being dramatically undermined by the violence and crimes against the Syrian people. It is deeply troubling that the most influential global and regional actors have so far failed to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria. Bosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the Geneva peace talks and the efforts of the International Syria Support Group to find a political solution to this conflict. The peaceful future of Syria rests upon respecting the will of the Syrian people and allowing them to express that will in democratic elections.\nThe so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has severely destabilized Syria, Iraq and the broader Middle East, posing a grave threat to international security. Its ideology, objectives and actions are contrary to all values and norms of our civilization. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the atrocities, systematic abuses of human rights and violations of international law committed by ISIL. As a member of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to contribute within our means to international efforts to defeat this terrorist organization.\nTerrorism is a global threat that affects us all. No State or society is immune to it, and no State alone can counter it. With violent extremism on the rise and a growing number of foreign fighters, terrorism is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge that requires a comprehensive response involving the collaboration of all States, employing both preventative and security measures. We face a problem that has deep and complex roots, that transcends national boundaries, and that cannot, and should not, be associated with any one religion, nationality or ethnic group. Those who perpetrate, organize and inspire terrorist attacks, claiming to do so in the name of Islam, want to turn Islam into an ideology of global fear. Violent extremism and terrorism are unacceptable from the viewpoint of any religion, including Islam. They undermine Islam\u2019s system of values and its universal teachings of tolerance and coexistence.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is strongly committed to combating terrorism in all its forms. We are deeply concerned with the rise of violent extremism, and attach a great importance to countering it. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism as another useful tool in a comprehensive whole-of-United Nations approach to preventing violent extremism. The prevention of extremism and the promotion of human rights are inextricably linked. Inclusive governance and respect for the rule of law are of paramount importance. Political, economic and social injustices around the world contribute to the rise of despair and hopelessness, creating a fertile ground for the emergence of radicalism and violent extremism.\nIn the imperfect world in which we live, injustice is constantly growing, but actions that cause further injustice are not the right response. Our Governments must and will respond to violence with forceful and repressive measures. However, if that part of our response is not carried out precisely and selectively, with respect for human rights and the rule of law, it will only cause a new wave of radicalization. The real fight and ultimate victory must and can be reached solely on the ideological level.\nOur approach and strategy must be holistic. We must apply a wide range of policies and measures that address the economic and social conditions conducive to the spread of violent extremism that terrorist organizations exploit to drive recruitment and radicalization. In particular, we must work harder to eliminate discrimination, prejudice and xenophobia in our societies, reduce poverty and inequality, improve education and expand opportunities, especially for our younger generations.\nThe engagement of the United Nations has never been more critical, as we face unprecedented challenges in confronting the surge in violence in various forms around the world. Global action, guided by the principles of international law, is required to put an end to the violence and instability in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Libya and other crisis areas. Ensuring the protection of civilians and compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law is imperative. Neutrality and indifference lead to resentment and frustration, further emboldening those who leave devastation and sorrow in their wake.\nHumanitarian aid can never serve as a substitute for solutions that address the root causes of conflict, nor can it create the necessary conditions for lasting peace and stability. The main causes of modern conflicts are discrimination and exclusion, failures of governance, impunity, deep-rooted poverty and the lack of opportunity, aggravated by the growing effects of climate change. In our increasingly interconnected world, we can no longer keep the impact of faraway conflicts outside our borders, nor can we ignore their global consequences. Our past failures, which came at a very high human cost, should have taught us how to better prevent and end conflicts. The scenes from Syria or the Mediterranean shores are a painful reminder that we have not learned those lessons and are still failing to turn our promises into actions.\nWe must act upon early-warning signs of potential conflict. It is critically important to develop and strengthen shared frameworks for conflict-risk analysis, including early-warning mechanisms at the local, national, regional and international levels. Bosnia and Herzegovina encourages the better use of Articles 34 and 99 of the Charter of the United Nations by the Security Council in order to place greater emphasis on preventive diplomacy in situations that could give rise to conflict or threaten international peace and security. Early United Nations engagement and use of the Secretary-General\u2019s good offices, combined with regional mediation efforts, can also substantially reduce the risk of conflict. We support the United Nations in convening an international conflict-prevention forum by 2020, and we urge the Secretary-General to develop a comprehensive United Nations plan to strengthen conflict prevention.\nWe recognize the value of introducing United Nations peacebuilding efforts at an early stage, alongside peacekeeping activities. The contemporary peace and security environment demands increasingly complex peacekeeping missions with coherent mandates that effectively correspond to situations on the ground. We are proud to have contributed to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Congo and in Mali with our military peacekeepers and with police officers in South Sudan, Liberia, Cyprus and Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of whom were women.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is deeply committed to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, multilateralism and the settling of international disputes and conflicts through peaceful means. Using the advantages of our geopolitical position as a bridge between the East and the West and a meeting point of civilizations, we want to advance dialogue and understanding and forge partnerships with friendly countries around the world. We strongly value and are committed to regional and subregional cooperation and remain active in a number of regional initiatives focusing on peacebuilding, migration, cross-border security and development issues.\nAt home and abroad, we will continue to uphold and promote good governance, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We will continue advocating the use of all available legal mechanisms to seek and achieve justice for all victims of crimes against humanity, because we believe that truth and justice are prerequisites for achieving lasting reconciliation, peace and security.\nIn the past year we have seen a renewed sense of unity and unprecedented levels of commitment. We acceded to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the Addis Ababa Action Plan on Transformative Financing for Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Agenda for Humanity and the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We have collectively committed ourselves to the betterment of humankind with our renewed focus on conflict prevention and resolution and our strengthened efforts towards sustainable development, equal opportunity for all, the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.\nPeace and security cannot be detached from either development or environmental agendas. Peace is not merely the absence of violence. It is freedom from fear and insecurity. There can be no lasting peace and security when injustice and inequality are an everyday experience for millions of people or when basic rights and freedoms are denied to so many human beings. The resulting grievances make our States unstable and our societies vulnerable and readily fuel extremism, radicalization and violence. Injustice and inequality diminish the human potential of our communities, leaving development and prosperity beyond their reach.\nThe road towards progress goes from ending poverty to reducing inequality and building just, equitable, tolerant, open and inclusive societies, with respect for human rights and the promotion of the rule of law at the core of our every action. History will judge us by the difference we make in the lives of millions of people who are suffering from marginalization, discrimination, poverty, malnutrition, disease, natural disasters and climate change. We must listen to their voices and respond to their needs, hopes and aspirations. We must find the will and courage to take urgent actions to turn the agendas we agreed upon into instruments of true global change, honouring our pledge to humankind and leaving a legacy true to our values.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to address the General Assembly on behalf of Montenegro and to once again reaffirm the unequivocal commitment of my country to the United Nations.\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji on his election as President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. We welcome the theme chosen for this sessin, in the light of the universal importance of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the Assembly at its seventieth session, for his leadership and his many efforts invested in creating prerequisites for the efficient implementation of crucial agreements on sustainable development and climate change.\nThis is the last general debate for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I would like to express my particular appreciation to him for his essential contributions aimed at building a safer and more prosperous world, especially in the light of the past decade, one tarnished by myriad challenges and crises. It could not have been easy to lead the Organization in such conditions.\nDespite the progress made in many areas, the current global situation raises many concerns. In many places around the world, peace, stability and sustainable economic development are still proving unattainable. Brutal and long-term conflicts have taken their toll on hundreds and thousands of individuals, destroying millions of people\u2019s lives, the majority of whom are women and children. Extreme poverty, weak institutions and serious breaches of human rights are still the harsh reality for a large number of people around the world. Fundamental pillars of international law are being violated by non-State stakeholders, and violent extremism and terrorism induce constant instability, leading to millions of people being forced to leave their homes. Other countries\u2019 willingness to admit them is becoming increasingly uncertain, and the humanitarian funds raised are insufficient to meet those people\u2019s basic needs.\nIn the current situation, where increasingly complex challenges know no boundaries and where no country is able to cope alone, we are compelled to turn to the United Nations, a world Organization like no other, where collective solutions can be reached. It is encouraging that the past few years have been marked by historic multilateral agreements, paving the way for global transformation and sustainable progress. That is a reflection of the general willingness to change the status quo. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 carry significant importance and are characterized by their interdependence. It is time to assume our responsibility and commit to their implementation, so that all citizens have an equal chance to live a dignified life without violence, discrimination or extreme poverty.\nMontenegro, despite its size and small share in global emissions, has been committed to implementing the agreements I mentioned through sustainable development initiatives, even though its contribution may be small. Montenegro is one of 22 Members of the United Nations to have presented a voluntary national report on the implementation and monitoring of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs at the High-level Political Forum in July, further proof of that commitment.\nMontenegro was also one of the first States to adopt the SDGs as part of a national sustainable development strategy, in place until 2030. The strategy ensures that the principal measures needed to achieve long-term sustainable development goals in Montenegro have been implemented, while the country has also adhered to all necessary international commitments in line with the 2030 Agenda. The strategy is for the long term and aims not only to boost the economy and help the environment but also to capitalize on human resources and social capital. That should lead to prosperous development for our country\u2019s citizens.\nMontenegro strongly believes that the Paris Agreement is a foundation on which further efforts to preserve climate systems can be based, thereby ensuring that all countries, regardless of their stage of development, progressively raise their ambitions in order to achieve their final goals. In line with the provisions of the Paris Agreement, Montenegro reaffirms its ambitious contribution, which is to reduce its own greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent compared with those of 1990. We wish to formally ratify that commitment as soon as possible, in order to initiate its implementation.\nOur commitment to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement will pose a challenge for our entire system and will need to include all the stakeholders at the national and local levels of management and in all segments of society. Like many other countries, Montenegro will require additional support from the international community and the financial mechanisms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I refer primarily to the Green Climate Fund.\nToo often the international community is not able to prevent or end bloodshed, criminal activity and the suffering of millions of people around the world. The conflict in Syria, which has continuously attracted attention from the international community and the United Nations, is the most tragic illustration of that inability. Montenegro expresses its deep concern at the conflict and the deteriorating humanitarian security situation, the repercussions of which are felt globally. We fully support an urgent cessation of violence and wish to point out the need for all parties to adhere to international law and United Nations resolutions. It is unacceptable for the international community to condone the war\u2019s atrocities. It is not only morally unacceptable, but also contradictory to international law. Therefore, in the absence of a political solution, a temporary agreement must be reached that respects the principles of international law and that would at least alleviate human suffering. Such crimes must not go unpunished \u2014 their perpetrators have to be held responsible for breaches of international law and its principles.\nThe role that the Security Council plays in international and hybrid criminal tribunals is of vital importance. The crises and conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and other countries demonstrate the importance of finding a long-term, peaceful solution through political and diplomatic means, which must have supremacy. The fragile and deteriorating nature of international peace and security and its ramifications clearly indicate that our current global approach \u2014 that of managing violence and crisis \u2014 must give way to an approach based on prevention. It is high time to move from rhetoric to action.\nMediation, a very efficient and peaceful way to prevent conflict, has not been given enough attention, despite Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations. Montenegro, being fully aware of the importance of mediation, is organizing a conference next year to contribute to further enhancing mediation in the turbulent area of the Mediterranean. Throughout its history, including in its recent past, Montenegro has been affected by numerous conflicts. Our enthusiasm for and commitment to mediation flow from our commitment to honest dialogue and cooperation. We believe that mediation is the best way to overcome differences, alleviate tension and reach final solutions.\nHumankind is facing humanitarian, refugee and migrant crises not seen since the Second World War. We deem it exceptionally important that the General Assembly took up this topic through its hosting of the high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants. We are in favour of implementing the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1).\nWe must not for a moment forget that today the world is facing the constant threat of terrorism and violent extremism. Terrorist attacks worldwide and the killing of civilians remind us that we have made only limited progress in dealing with this complex and evolving phenomenon, and that more resolute efforts, unity, coordination and a more active role by every individual State Member of the United Nations are required. Our actions to counter terrorism must focus on preventive measures and on the social, economic and political situation. More especially, they must target vulnerable and marginalized groups, because people susceptible to radicalism are primarily recruited from these groups. The implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is the best chance to make a positive difference in this respect. Emphasis must be placed on youth and their empowerment, primarily through employment and education.\nIn a year that marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of two key international instruments on human rights and fundamental freedoms, the United Nations is facing major challenges with regard to human rights protection and overwhelming humanitarian crises. Therefore, it is necessary to reaffirm the strong commitment of all Member States to the multilateral system of protection and promotion of human rights. The full and immediate application of high standards in the protection of human rights and the translation of international norms into practice in every Member State, without exception, are the prerequisites for peace, stability and development. The United Nations and its Member States should make a much greater effort so that all rights, not only civic and political rights but also economic and social rights, are guaranteed in order to build the necessary conditions to ensure that no one is left behind in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe integration of human rights into development policies, especially public policies protecting the rights of the most vulnerable groups at the national level, is a necessary step for effective protection. In that context, the consistent application of the principles of sustainable and inclusive growth in the implementation of economic growth strategies is a necessary precondition for combating poverty and social exclusion.\nIn order for the United Nations to maintain and strengthen its central position in the system of global governance, the Organization must undergo reforms and adapt to the circumstances of the twenty-first century and to modern democratic principles. The priority in that regard remains a comprehensive reform of the Security Council in order to enhance its efficiency and transparency.\nThe Delivering as One approach, which Montenegro is also applying, has already delivered positive results in the cooperation between the Organization and host countries. It should therefore be further refined, especially in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nMontenegro welcomes the changes introduced as a result of the negotiations on the role of the General Assembly in the process of selecting the Secretary- General. They will help to strengthen transparency and competitiveness and ensure a merit-based approach. Montenegro is proud to have put forward a candidate for the most responsible position in the United Nations system. We have thereby made a qualitative and quantitative contribution to the selection of the best candidate. At the same time, this also confirms our readiness to contribute even more actively to the universal goals of the Charter of the United Nations. On this occasion, I want to express the hope and expectation that the new Secretary-General will come from one of the Eastern European countries, given the need to respect the principle of regional rotation and the fact that our geographical group is the only one never to have provided the Secretary-General to date.\nMontenegro marked the tenth anniversary of its membership in the United Nations on 28 June. This was a historic day for our country. It was the greatest confirmation of independence, restored Montenegrin statehood, a signal that we have taken our rightful place in the world family of nations. Since regaining independence, we are continuously strengthening our State in accordance with the European Euro-Atlantic standard, and I am pleased to note that Montenegro is today an example of stability, multi-ethnicity and respect for differences; a reliable neighbour and a reliable international partner; and a leader in Euro- Atlantic integration in the region.\nGiven our experience, we know that institutions are a foundation for the stability of the State and the rule of law. Integration into NATO and the European Union are national strategic priorities. In May this year Montenegro signed the NATO accession protocol. We believe that the process of ratification of the protocol will be finalized in the short term and that we will very soon meet all the formal preconditions to become a full-fledged member State of NATO. The importance of this historic step for Montenegro will not diminish our enthusiasm for the further improvement of our security, legal and political systems, as NATO membership requires. The same applies as regards our readiness to contribute to peace and stability in the region and beyond.\nWe have opened 24 of the requisite 35 chapters in the process of our accession to the European Union. We are making strides on the path to membership, reaffirming the potential and capacity of Montenegrin society and its institutions. Montenegro continues to be a reliable and responsible partner for the international community and the United Nations.\nMontenegro is a member of the Peacebuilding Commission. It is also a member of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Office for Project Services. We have been elected to membership of the Executive Board of UN- Women, starting next year. After serving on the Human Rights Council from 2014 to 2016, we submitted our application for membership in the Council for the 2022-2024 period. We also presented our candidacy for the Security Council for the 2026-2027 period. We have expanded our participation in the United Nations peacekeeping missions by deploying military observers to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.\nThe foregoing are indicators that Montenegro is firmly committed to the promotion of the United Nations and to multilateralism and joint action in order to guarantee a peaceful, stable, prosperous and equal world. We are determined to actively and constructively contribute to the efforts of the United Nations in this regard.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and I hope that the decisions and initiatives taken by the Assembly will play an effective role in resolving the problems that our world is currently facing.\nFifteen years have passed since the painful terrorist attack in this city, a disaster whose human dimensions moved the entire world. On that day, no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters or result in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe. This war has sown the seeds of borderless terrorism everywhere on Earth. Today, the most pressing question as to why we are facing such a situation should be on the agenda of every international forum. We need to find out which approaches, policies and erroneous actions have paved the way for the spread of insecurity throughout the world and what the world will look like 15 years from now.\nSecurity has become a global problem at a time when major Powers are mainly focusing on advancing different methods of repression and military intervention under the pretext of creating a secure environment for their citizens. The genesis of borderless violent extremism and terrorism could be attributed to the security strategies developed by major Powers in the past 15 years. The main lesson to be learned from the analysis of this trend is that security in one region at the cost of insecurity in others is not only impossible, but it also leads to greater insecurity everywhere. Terrorists have even gone as far as claiming to have established States in the Levant, Iraq and Libya. More unfortunately, they hide their nefarious intents behind religious literature, thereby turning a compassionate religion into an instrument of violence and terror by spreading extremist and takfiri propaganda, which is all too regrettable.\nThe century that began with terror and violence in New York should not continue with hostile competition and expanding conflicts in the Middle East. Today the discourse of hatred and violence in the Middle East and North Africa is spreading with astonishing speed. The region is caught in a web of the most savage and destructive of policies. Millions of Syrians are stranded in deserts or on high seas, and hundreds of thousands of them die a violent death. Iraqis of every ethnic group are concerned about their territorial integrity and the future of their homeland. The defenceless people of Yemen are subjected to daily aerial bombardments. Following decades of occupation and atrocities, Afghanistan has yet to be released from the grip of suffering, violence and terror. The oppressed Palestinians continue to be afflicted by the apartheid policies and atrocities set by the usurping Zionist regime.\nUndoubtedly, if the region is to reverse the current dangerous trends and move towards development and stability, certain countries must stop bombing their neighbours and abandon their support for takfiri terrorist groups, while accepting responsibility and trying to compensate for past mistakes. If the Saudi Government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from the use of divisive policies, stop spreading hate ideology and refrain from trampling upon the rights of neighbours. It must accept its responsibility for the protection of the lives and dignity of pilgrims and construct relations with the nations in the region on the basis of mutual respect and accountability.\nThe future of our region rests on dealing with fundamental challenges, including security crises. Due to inefficiency and lack of Government legitimacy, we will not be able to combat criminal and terrorist networks without genuine democracy or a participatory approach at national and transnational levels. We believe that countries in our region can create a shared future on the basis of their common history and culture and by isolating terrorist groups. We should never again allow our region to run the risk of dismemberment, given the impact of what took place close to a century ago.\nIran\u2019s principled approach calls for constructive partnership with our neighbours, with a view to establishing an enduring order based on shared security and efforts aimed at enhancing the developments of countries in the region and mutually beneficial economic cooperation. In order to uproot violence in the region there is no choice but to focus on promoting democracy, citizenship rights and economic development.\nIran opposes any kind of sectarianism and any attempt to promote religious divisions. For centuries, the Muslim people, be they Shiites or Sunnis, have lived and continue to live together in harmony and mutual respect. Attempts to turn religious dissimilarities into tense confrontations are rooted in the vested interests of certain countries, which are trying to hide their quests for power behind religious slogans. Iran considers it imperative to preserve the territorial integrity of States, keep national borders intact, enhance people\u2019s right to self-determination and uphold the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force. We also reiterate the need to use diplomacy in conflict resolution.\nDespite today\u2019s difficulties, I have hope in tomorrow. I have no doubt that we can prevail through prudence and wisdom. The experience acquired through dialogue between Iran and the P5+1 and the fruition of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are indicative of the success that we could achieve through moderation, constructive interaction and the promotion of dialogue. A long, complicated and unnecessary crisis was brought to an end by the adoption of a win-win approach. The deal confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme through the use of confidence-building mechanisms and entails the closure of the so-called possible military dimensions file and the reinstatement of Iran\u2019s right to develop a peaceful nuclear programme.\nThe deal also has put an end to unfounded concerns, leading to the removal of the brutal sanctions imposed against Iran. Beyond the nuclear file, however, the JCPOA holds important lessons the resolving complicated international problems. The deal is not only a political agreement; it also represents a creative approach and method for engaging in constructive interaction with a view to peacefully resolving crises and challenges. The lessons learned from the JCPOA will serve to improve international relations. We should never forget that these pressures, sanctions and illegal threats against the Iranian people, designed to fully dismantle Iran\u2019s enrichment programme, were all defeated. Today, the Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency have formally accepted Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear programme.\nThe United States is fully aware that the JCPOA constitutes a recognized multilateral agreement and that any failure on the part of the United States in implementing it would constitute an wrongful act under international law, to which the international community would object. Any failure in the implementation of the JCPOA will further erode the credibility of the United States around the world.\nBreaches in compliance with the JCPOA by the United States in the past several months represents an error that should be rectified forthwith. Unfortunately, such illegal actions are not unprecedented. The latest example of this is the recent United States Supreme Court ruling which affirmed the legality of the seizure of billions of dollars in assets belonging to the Iranian people. This experience demonstrates that Zionist pressure groups could go so far as to persuade the United States Congress to pass indefensible legislation that forces the highest American judicial institution to violate peremptory norms of international law.\nWith God\u2019s help, the Iranian people\u2019s fortitude and the increased participation of Iran\u2019s partners from various regions around the world, and only eight months after the lifting of the cruel nuclear-related sanctions against my country, the economy of Iran, as the safest and most profitable destination for investment in our region, is showing clear improvement. Iran\u2019s economic growth rate surpassed 4 per cent in the spring of 2016, the inflation rate dropped to single digits, and Iran has come close to pre-sanction levels of oil production and exports. All in all, we are seeing greater development in the economic, scientific and technological sectors of the country.\nIran is one of the rare oil-producing countries that may be able to offset the shocking impact of the sharp slide in oil price in 2014. In order to attract investment, we are intent on strengthening economic stability and consistency through economic reforms and fiscal and financial discipline while preserving low rates of inflation. Economic growth is set to increase to around 5 per cent by the end of 2016. Based on all domestic and international predictions, Iran is currently enjoying one the highest growth rates among oil-producing countries.\nIn conclusion, I would like to clearly state that it is my deep belief that, despite setbacks, moderation will prevail over extremism, peace will triumph over violence, enlightenment will overcome ignorance and, finally, justice will conquer injustice. What is important is that we channel our beliefs, hopes and efforts towards realizing peace and justice. If we do so, there is no doubt that the Almighty will assist all those who endeavour for peace, justice and moderation, and that God will help those who assist Him by defending his path, for the Lord is strong and mighty.\n"

        "file_name": "NAM_71_2016.txt",
        "file_text": "Let me congratulate the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. He hails from a country that is held in high esteem and greatly respected by the Namibian people. Namibia is a child of international solidarity and was midwifed by the United Nations. Fiji was one of the countries that contributed peacekeepers to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. Given his background, we are confident that this session will be a complete success.\nThe President rightly emphasized in his acceptance speech (see A/70/PV.103) that the main purpose of the seventy-first session would be to achieve momentum on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Such momentum is evidenced by the choice of theme of the session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. Namibia joins the President in reiterating the fact that the implementation of this Agenda is imperative if we are to safeguard a secure world for future generations.\nAs the Secretary-General has said in his report on the work of the United Nations (A/71/1), the people of the world have implored the United Nations to do more now \u2014 in more spheres of activity, in more locations, in more challenging circumstances \u2014 than at any other point in the history of the Organization. The Secretary- General\u2019s commitment to the Organization and concern about the present issues affecting the world have impressed me. He indicated that he has fought to leave the Organization better prepared for the immense challenges ahead and capable of serving its entire membership and \u201cwe the peoples\u201d in every corner of the world. He has raised the bar, and, indeed, the onus is now on us to carry the mantle of humanitarian excellence to even greater heights.\nIn September last year, we committed ourselves to a new Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are all in agreement that the effective implementation of that Agenda will require coherence and complementarity among global, continental, regional, national and local efforts, as stated in the Secretary-General\u2019s report. We are confident that we will join the global drive to ensure a life of dignity for all. We will spare no effort in working to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.\nNamibia agrees with the notion that the Agenda, successor to the Millennium Development Goals, will need to fully integrate economic growth, social justice and environmental stewardship. In terms of economic growth, we need to talk about inclusive growth that will translate into the creation of decent jobs opportunities for our citizens. In other words, we must do more to move away from the current jobless growth model that prevails in many of our member countries. We should therefore aim to grow our economy in a sustainable and inclusive manner in order to ensure that we effectively tackle the scourge of poverty.\nAs a consequence of the slowdown in the global economic cycle and a drop in commodity prices, the Namibian economy is experiencing a downturn this year, following robust growth averaging more than 5 per cent during the previous five years. We are mindful that, in order to make a meaningful dent in poverty, we need to grow at a higher level. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for Namibia, as key economic fundamentals, including fiscal and external current account sustainability, remain intact. A testament to this is the fact that the Fitch Ratings agency recently affirmed Namibia\u2019s international default rate at BBB-, with bond issuance in the South African and Namibian markets at AA+, although the longer-term outlook was revised from stable to negative.\nThe Government of the Republic of Namibia remains committed to managing the economy in a prudent and responsible manner and has already instituted expenditure, revenue and structural reform measures to address concerns raised by rating agencies about the long-term outlook of our country We would like to assure all our partners that there is no risk of Namibia not honouring its debt obligations in the near and medium terms. In fact, we remain bullish about the country\u2019s economic outlook. Moreover, we remain committed to creating conditions in Namibia that will enable the full participation of the private sector in the economy. The Government alone cannot shoulder the burden of extending development to all. The private sector has a crucial role to play in stimulating economic growth and job creation in our country.\nRegarding social justice, we are all concerned by the fact that we are witnessing the highest levels of forced displacement of people since the founding of this Organization. The current refugee crisis needs our immediate attention and our collective action. As the Secretary-General says in his report (A/71/1), global solidarity is needed for us to effectively respond to the needs of our fellow human beings. We need to determine the basic factors that cause people to flee in such large numbers so that we can tackle the root causes, rather than the symptoms, of this evil. Our belief is that no one must feel left out, for we are aware that inclusivity spells peace, while exclusivity spells war.\nEarlier this morning we attended the high-level event on the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Namibia welcomes this development, and we are happy to announce that we have ratified the Agreement, which represents a milestone in our endeavours to fight the devastating effects of climate change. Climate change is a global problem and requires a global response from all of us, in both developed and developing countries. In this regard, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Sendai Declaration on disaster risk reduction remain the central multilateral frameworks for cooperative action for addressing climate-change-induced disaster risks, such as drought.\nNamibia is one of the driest countries in the world. Consequently, we have undertaken ambitious domestic action on climate change, including mitigation and adaptation, to surmount the losses and damages arising from climate-change-induced natural disasters. At the same time, we are developing renewable energy resources, such as solar, wind and hydroelectricity power. In tackling this crisis, the principle of common yet differentiated responsibility must be upheld.\nFurthermore, the activation of the Green Climate Fund is a welcome and timely development. This accords us an opportunity to decentralize the operations of the Fund. In this context, I wish to announce Namibia\u2019s offer to host the African regional hub of the Green Climate Fund at the appropriate time. As members may recall, Namibia came in second to South Korea in the bid to host the world headquarters of the Green Climate Fund. As a consolation prize, we would therefore be honoured to host the African regional hub of the Green Climate Fund. Namibia counts on the support of Member States.\nNamibia believes that the United Nations remains the centre for the consolidation of international rule of law. Therefore, the United Nations system should serve as a banner of transparency and accountability. For Governments and organizations such as the United Nations to regain the trust of people who have lost trust in global leadership over the years, inclusivity and transparency must be placed at the forefront of governance; for transparency plus accountability equals trust.\nReforming the Security Council is therefore paramount. The reform of the Security Council cannot be reduced to the aspirations of a few countries. The Security Council is too important an organ to be left to the interests of a few. Hence we reiterate our call for the comprehensive reform of the Security Council, thereby making it more democratic and transparent so as to better serve humanity. Namibia remains fully committed to the Common African Position on the proposed reform of the United Nations. We are of the opinion that the Security Council should reflect the broad membership of our Organization. Fairness and justice warrant that Africa be part of the equation.\nAs a nation that emerged from a long, bitter and bloody struggle for independence and has since enjoyed 26 years of freedom, Namibia sympathizes with those who are not yet independent and who are denied their basic human rights. Accordingly, Namibia calls for the full implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions on Palestine. The international community must fulfil its obligations and assist the people of Palestine in realizing their basic right to independence and self-determination. Their freedom and independence cannot be denied forever \u2014 it can only be delayed. Let history be our best teacher.\nNamibia recognizes and acknowledges the role played by the Kingdom of Morocco in helping us attain our independence. I can proudly say that the people of Morocco are our brothers and sisters, which was affirmed during my two-day visit to that country. We are a nation that believes in being an enemy to none and a friend to all, and we also believe in a world where no one should feel left out. Unfortunately, our brothers and sisters in Western Sahara do feel left out.\nWe therefore hope that the people of Western Sahara will soon enjoy the freedom that the Kingdom of Morocco helped Namibia to attain. It is in this regard that we call for the full implementation of resolutions calling for a referendum in occupied Western Sahara, so that the people there can freely express themselves as to whether they opt for independence or unification with Morocco and so that the disagreement between brothers and sisters can come to an amicable end.\nNamibia remains confident that despite the fact that humankind faces some of the most unprecedented challenges in its history, under the United Nations we can live up to the promise of ensuring a life of dignity for all. Let us not lose heart, for Saint Teresa of Calcutta once said: \u201cIf we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.\u201d Let us therefore realize that our differences should not draw us further from one another, but, rather, nearer to each other. Let us celebrate unity in diversity.\nTogether as people who realize that we belong to each other, we can bring about change in this world through this indispensable institution \u2014 the United Nations. It is time to usher in a new era of humanity, characterized by peace, unity and dignity for all the world\u2019s citizens.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to extend the usual warm greetings from the Government and the people of Grenada, on whose behalf I am privileged to address the General Assembly and its members. I am also pleased to join colleagues who spoke before me in thanking the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, for his energetic and focused leadership. I commend Mr. Lykketoft for so diligently charting the course towards transforming our world through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nI must also congratulate and thank Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his extraordinary leadership of the United Nations, and express our deep gratitude, especially for the keen interest he has shown in addressing the developmental challenges facing small island developing States. I also wish to assure the incoming President, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation and support as he encourages cooperation under this session\u2019s theme: that is,\u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d.\nAllow me to use this rostrum to recognize the contribution of a gigantic Grenadian personality who passed away this week \u2014 Sir Lamuel Stanislaus, who served Grenada, the region and the Organization with distinction and honour for over a decade as Grenada\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and one year as Vice-President of the General Assembly. Sir Lamuel was the embodiment of diplomacy and statesmanship. His contributions transcend nationality, geography and subject matter. His was an eloquent and convincing voice in this Hall, addressing issues on behalf of his country and his region. May his soul rest in peace. I believe it is ironic that that very noble gentleman was buried today, the same day in which Grenada addresses the Assembly.\nGrenada unwaveringly recommits to the United Nations and its principles, as outlined in the Charter. Our commitment to the norms of peace, equality, justice, human rights and multilateralism is clear. At home, Grenada continues to embrace opportunities to consolidate democratic values and practices in civic life. I am proud to inform the Assembly that on 27 October, Grenadians\u2019 voices will be heard on the matter of broad constitutional reform.\nI hail from the tiny island of Carriacou, which, together with Petite Martinique, forms my constituency and part of mainland Grenada, and makes up our tri- island State. One of the possible results of the upcoming referendum could be a change in the name of the State so as to better represent the collective identity of our nation.\nThe reforms also include amendments to the Bill of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, which would guarantee access to public education to every Grenadian child up to 16 years of age, and would further ensure that children with disabilities are afforded public education tailored to their specific needs up to age 18.\nGrenada is committed to Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which speaks to gender equality and discrimination against women and girls. The reforms also call on the State to ensure that men and women enjoy equal rights and status in all spheres of life, especially in economic, educational, political, civic and social activities; that women are not discriminated against by reason of marital status, pregnancy or any other gender-based attribute; and that Parliament can enact suitable laws to correct disparities and inequalities between men and women.\nWe live in a world that is plagued with many challenges: civil wars, famine, droughts, floods, the impacts of climate change, humanitarian and economic crises, and terrorism. But we also built the United Nations for the express purpose of addressing such challenges. The United Nations was built to steer us away from anarchy and perpetual antagonism.\nWith the 17 Sustainable Development Goals we have created a new pathway to achieve a more equitable and lasting brand of development. That pathway is paved with clean energy, universal access to education, affordable health care, food security, clean water and air, and gender and racial equality. History has shown that development is tenuous whenver human rights and the environment are not prioritized. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are the product of deep reflection and learning, and the realization that development without human rights and environmental considerations is unreliable.\nDespite the remarkable progress made on each of the Millennium Development Goals, the fact that at least $2.5 trillion will be needed each year for the SDGs signals the size of the gap that remains to be addressed.\nGrenada is resolute in its commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 14, on the conservation and promotion of the sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources. Earlier this year, Grenada hosted Blue Week 2016. That conference was held in collaboration and partnership with the Governments of the Netherlands and Indonesia and with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank, the Global Forum on Oceans, Coasts and Islands, the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Caribbean Challenge Initiative and The Nature Conservancy. At that event, we employed the innovative and popular \u201cshark-tank\u201d approach, which allowed local and international ocean entrepreneurs to pitch project ideas for funding. The rationale was that we cannot continue to merely talk about problems at ocean conferences; we need to facilitate solutions and commitments for the sustainable development and use of our oceans.\nThe ocean economy is a very important starting point for thinking about conservation. The natural capital of the ocean is like the principal deposited in an interest-bearing bank account. Unfortunately, instead of living off the interest, we have been drawing down from the principal.\nThe work done by World Wide Fund for Nature International and the Boston Consulting Group on the Ocean Economy has described the estimated $24 trillion asset value of the oceans, which generates some $2.5 trillion per year. The need to preserve that natural capital is self evident. But when we consider data provided by the World Bank and FAO, we see that the world is losing $83 billion per year from unsustainable fisheries practices. Nine Caribbean nations have committed to conserving and managing 20 per cent of their marine and coastal environments by 2020. I am pleased to note that Grenada has committed to conserving 25 per cent of its coastal area and marine resources by 2020. Both of those commitments are well above target 5 of Goal 14 of the SDGs, which calls for 10 per cent conservation by 2020.\nSmall island nations in the Caribbean and the Pacific must be lead advocates for oceans and climate change. Most of us have more space in the sea than we do on land. In Grenada, for instance, our maritime territory is 75 times our land mass. The ratios are even higher for other archipelagoes. That is why Grenada is pleased to play a leading role, not only in the Blue Network, but also in the Blue Guardians, facilitated by the Clinton Foundation and the Global Island Partnership initiatives for islands. We invite other countries to partner with us and participate in both.\nGrenada is also helping the Blue Network create an online database and platform for ocean-related projects seeking funding. That initiative, called BluNet, will be showcased at Oceans Day during the twenty- second Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in November this year in Marrakesh, Morocco.\nFinancing difficulties and our small size severely affect our ability to invest in renewable energy projects. Today Grenada calls on Member States, especially the ones that possess the technology and technical capacity, to continue to work with small island developing States so as to increase their ability to harness existing renewable energy opportunities.\nGrenada is almost 100 per cent reliant on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation. As a result, our development is held hostage to global price fluctuations and the high cost of electricity generation. We therefore call for easier access to the Green Climate Fund to support renewable energy projects in small island developing States.\nIn that regard, Grenada calls for a commitment from world leaders to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by the end of 2016. We hope that the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties, which will be held in about six weeks, will build on the gains of the previous session and garner the necessary momentum to enable the full implementation of the Paris Agreement.\nGrenada further calls upon the international community to work with Grenada and other small island developing States on innovative approaches to international climate financing, which would include catalysing private investment.\nLike many small island developing States, we suffer from debt overhang, which limits the fiscal space needed to address climate challenge. While the International Monetary Fund has consistently expressed satisfaction with Grenada\u2019s response aimed at addressing the structural deficiencies that are both a symptom and a cause of that overhang, that response has, unfortunately, required a huge sacrifice on the part of our citizens, who are already suffering from climate change, fossil fuel dependence and the financial crisis. Those three problems compound one another and collectively limit our ability to invest in climate action that can actually alleviate all three issues, which has created a vicious circle.\nWorking with partners, Grenada will optimize various leadership platforms to create practical, concrete initiatives to turn that vicious circle into a virtuous one, where climate action can catalyse a wave of public and private investment that can alleviate all three problems. Such measures would help small States like Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique take action to combat climate change and its impacts in areas such as potable water supply, renewable energy and energy efficiency, climate-smart agriculture, climate-resilient homes and buildings and resilient coasts and oceans, to name a few. Those are the developments that our people are demanding, not for tomorrow but for today. When we observe the climate changes in our world today and their effects on humankind, we owe it to ourselves and succeeding generations to act with immediacy \u2014 we must act now.\nAs we attempt to transform our world, we are confronted with certain global financial policies and actions that pose significant threats to our region\u2019s sustainable development. Exclusion from correspondent banking services and de-risking, blacklisting and premature graduation to middle-income status are measures that negatively affect Caribbean economies. The unilateral and premature graduation of many small island developing States to middle-income status without consideration of our region\u2019s specific vulnerabilities has resulted in significant budgetary shortfalls, adversely affecting our economic and social development.\nOur region has inherent structural economic challenges that already restrict the pace of our development. We ask that those impediments to growth be taken into account when our cases come up for consideration. Indeed, the current formula generalizes where generalizations should not be made. Outside of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the intragroup differences among countries with middle-income status are astounding. Economists today admit that inequality had not been treated with any depth until very recently. Economists also readily admit that GDP is an imperfect measure of development.\nThe withdrawal of correspondent banking services from Caribbean Community member States can be seen as an economic assault that will destabilize the financial sector of our already vulnerable economies. For small economies like ours, the impact could be enormous. To give one example, the World Bank has indicated that more than 90 per cent of remittances are transferred through correspondent banking services. Remittances contribute in real and significant terms to the GDP of small nation-States. The World Bank goes on to state that a sudden stop in remittances in economies that rely on those flows could pose a significant threat to the socioeconomic stability of the region.\nGrenada applauds the progress made in the recent rapprochement between Cuba and the United States. Grenada sees the peaceful resolution of some of the issues in those relations through dialogue as an example to be emulated between and among all States where violence, conflicts or disputes prevail. Grenada reiterates that it neither promulgates, applies nor condones laws or measures that encroach upon or undermine the sovereign rights of any State, nor laws that restrict or hinder international trade or navigation by any State. Consequently, we issue another clarion call for the total lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on the Government and the people of Cuba by the United States of America.\nAs we forge ahead, it is important to bear in mind that poverty is multidimensional in nature and that its implications for our youth and women go beyond the concepts of income or consumption. The problems affecting our youth cannot be resolved only by addressing unemployment and poor working conditions we must also provide access to health care and decent opportunities. We must ensure that we are building the necessary skills and knowledge for that group to undertake economic activities, with an emphasis on vocational training, entrepreneurial skills and innovation for our young people.\nWe recognize the importance of regional cooperation and international partnerships in addressing the scourge of non-communicable diseases. We are adopting a holistic approach by utilizing the United Nations system, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization to provide a basis for the health agenda and to guide us forward. Of particular importance is assistance in addressing our capacity constraints, facilitating knowledge-sharing and allowing the use of innovative approaches that could be adapted to the needs of our country. President Obama, in his address to the Assembly a few days ago (see A/71/PV.8), reiterated that the health issues that we currently face respected no walls or boundaries. Let us therefore pool our collective energy and resources to build capacity to rid humankind of those scourges.\nGrenada continues its clarion call for a negotiated two-State settlement between Israel and Palestine. No matter what road is taken, the end result must enable the full economic, social, political and religious self- determination of the Palestinian people. Grenada recognizes the struggles of the Palestinian people and beseeches the international community to reject mere political pragmatism and the status quo while generations are being lost.\nThe United Nations membership must make Article 1, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations a major priority in the next few years. Our founding fathers called for the Organization to\n\u201cachieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion\u201d.\nWe must do everything in our power to provide additional economic opportunities for the developing world. I therefore call on the Economic and Social Council to actively pursue efforts to create an environment that enables Member States to raise the standard of living of their peoples. In our current global context, we must be conscious that inclusion in the global economy is vital.\nFinally, I must recall Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Charter, which calls for the Organization to \u201cmaintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace\u201d.\nWe must be relentless in our pursuit of the aims of the Organization. Our challenge is to work towards the elimination of terrorism, terrorist activities and armed conflicts around the world. Our quest must be to create economic opportunities for all States. And our goal should be the peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the international community. Indeed, if we can achieve that, we will be well on our way to transforming our world.\n"

        "file_text": "I am delighted and happy to be addressing the General Assembly today, and I would like to join my fellow leaders in congratulating the President on his election as its leader. The world has shown its confidence in him, and we are confident that he will steer the ship to the shore of our dreams. His election also testifies to our belief in the equality of our Member States, irrespective of their size.\nI would also like to sincerely commend His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his exceptional leadership during his tenure of office. We wish him every success in his future endeavours. I believe we will find an equally competent person to replace him. I have also noted with appreciation that the process of selecting the Secretary- General has, for the first time in the history of the United Nations, begun to address issues of transparency and democracy. If our job is to promote the political virtues of transparency and democracy around the world, we must indeed also be the first to show ourselves to be transparent and democratic.\nWe have engaged in a unanimous drive to transform our world. We have agreed that our road to a better world must follow the signposts of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which show us the road to ending poverty in the world. Today, we gather to look back on the road of progress and to renew our commitment to pursue those Goals to the end.\nThe mission of every generation should be to leave our world a better place for subsequent generations.\nBut our generation faces mountains of challenges. Our world stands in great peril. Innocent souls continue to suffer from the tragedy of wars. Many lives are maimed, mutilated or cut short. Political instability continues to shake the foundations of our dreams. Conflicts have scattered communities and driven them from their homes in endless migrations. We are caught in unending cycles of suffering, violence, terrorism, radicalization, extremism, abductions and human trafficking. That is a story that we can have no pride in recounting to the next generations. Our world is living a story of indignity and shame. Our planet is in great danger. Everywhere, global warming threatens our existence with hurricanes, cyclones, earthquakes, wildfires, extreme flooding and droughts, dangers that threaten the fragile economies of Africa and the Third World everywhere. Africa, and the rest of the developing world, is suffering from dehumanizing poverty, the pain of hunger, disease, inequalities and gender imbalances.\nMost of these are tragedies and challenges of our own creation. And the solutions lie in our hands. The choices for human destiny around the world lie with us in the Assembly. Those challenges must be resolved by us, for nobody else can resolve them. It must be done here, or nowhere else. It must be now, or never.\nWe have risen to the occasion of our times and begun the journey of conquest with the adoption of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. But we have only just begun. The sustainability of our pursuit and the attainment of our goals depend upon our common understanding and our walking together as a community of humankind. Malawi is doing its part and will continue to do its part. We continue to guarantee basic human rights because we can progress only with people who are free. We offer every care to our brothers and sisters who seek refuge in Malawi because we have a duty to humankind. We ensure peace, stability, security and tranquillity for everyone because we must create an environment for progress. We govern with the principles of democracy and the rule of law because humankind is safe only when everybody is accountable. And we pledge to continue living in peace with all of our neighbours because we value peace and harmony.\nMalawi\u2019s commitment to international peace and security is on record. We have been sending peacekeeping forces to various parts of Africa and beyond for a long time. I am happy to report that Malawi\u2019s record in peacekeeping is illustrative and outstanding. In that regard, we are committed to the work of the United Nations. As a beacon of peace, we also actively pursue the African Union\u2019s (AU) Agenda 2063 project \u201cSilencing the guns by 2020\u201d \u2014 and silence the guns we must.\nOn the economic front, Malawi continues to register steady but considerable progress, despite the attendant challenges. The country registered a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3.2 per cent in 2015, as compared with the global average of 3 per cent, and is expected to reach 5 per cent in 2016. Although inflation has been negatively affected by the food shortage, bulk maize importation should help to reduce inflation and consequently improve lending rates. Our domestic and foreign debts are within sustainable levels. And the economy is progressively generating much-needed jobs, particularly among our youth. Moving forward, the combination of robust fiscal and macroeconomic reform programmes that the country is implementing is projected to lead to further GDP growth, single-digit inflation and low lending rates, which will in turn lead to increased confidence, greater investment, more jobs and improved incomes.\nOur only major setback in the last two years was the effects of climate change. In 2015, we experienced terrible floods that affected over half of the country. In 2016, we endured just the opposite, as yet again half of the country was affected, this time by a scorching drought. When we consider climate change, let us remember that there are real souls out there suffering the effects. We, as a country, will do our duty to humankind. This afternoon, I will sign the Paris Agreement on Climate Change here at Headquarters and commit my Government to the ratification and implementation of that crucial document. Malawi has already adopted a climate change policy, which will guide our domestic implementation of the Paris Agreement. We are taking action on climate change.\nLet me also put on record that Malawi is making exemplary progress in the health sector. We are pioneering innovative approaches to the management of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We are among the few countries on the African continent that have successfully rolled out the test-and-treat programme. We are managing the pandemic. But we need concerted efforts to manage non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer.\nOn gender equality, Malawi is taking proactive measures to reduce the vulnerability of women and adolescent girls to violence and abuse. Consequently, we are focusing on addressing gender-based violence and balancing reproductive and productive roles in order to enhance women\u2019s participation in decision-making. This work entails collaboration with traditional leaders, in order to tackle retrogressive traditional practices that harm our women and the girl child. We have also enhanced legal and policy reforms and improved our law enforcement mechanism in that area. We are adopting the Gender Equality Act: Implementation and Monitoring Plan 2016-2020 as well as improved gender- sensitive data-collection approaches.\nOn trade issues, investment and market access, Malawi continues to open up the economy and offer numerous investment opportunities. We have opened up to investors in the mining, manufacturing, agriculture and adding value, tourism, transport, water, energy and financial sectors. We are rapidly improving our business climate. We are ready to do business with the world. I therefore invite the global community to patronize the annual Malawi Investment Forum, to be held in Lilongwe on 10 and 11 October. It is imperative that regional and global markets be free of distortions such as subsidies, tariffs and non-tariff barriers. We must live up to the aspirations of the World Trade Organization Doha Development Agenda. The global community must realize that it is only by taking such steps that African countries will be able to produce and add value to their commodities. That will generate the necessary jobs to keep our young people in the continent and propel our economies to sustainable growth and prosperity.\nWithout investments in those areas, it will continue to be a challenge to prevent African youth from taking desperate and dangerous action by crossing the seas and oceans to reach developed economies. Such investments will also reduce the risk of our youth being lured into radicalism and extremism, with the attendant threat to domestic and international peace and security. I must underline that poverty in African communities is a danger to the global community because poverty and the disenchantment of our youth can be an easy source of radicalization.\nSpeaking in my capacity as United Nations Youth Champion, I am fully committed to the promotion of youth development and harnessing the demographic dividend in Malawi, across the African Continent and beyond. I am delighted to report that the African Union has adopted \u201cHarnessing the Demographic Dividend\u201d as its theme for 2017. I wish, therefore, to call upon global leaders to join the efforts of the African Union and our global partners in prioritizing investments in our youth, in order to accelerate socioeconomic transformation and development at the global level.\nOn United Nations reform, the common African position is the one espoused as the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. Our firm belief is that the attainment of the SDGs cannot happen in an environment that is devoid of representation, fairness, efficiency, transparency and accountability, such as at the Security Council. My country therefore earnestly supports all efforts and work currently under way to find a suitable vehicle for the reform and revitalization of the United Nations, and shall seek every possible way to contribute to the appropriate solution on the matter.\nLet me conclude by reiterating that Malawi is making every effort to overcome the decades of underdevelopment, disease and hunger that have retarded the development of the country. That is our quest for the dignity of our people and their place in the world. Malawi is set to be a productive partner in our collective push to transform our world. We are the leaders of that transformation. We are the generation that must transform the world. History demands our collective leadership.\n"

I would also like to recognize his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the excellent work he accomplished while President. I particularly wish to thank and congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts and service to stability, peace, security and development in the world.\nBenin warmly welcomes the theme of this year\u2019s session, entitled \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, as it appropriately responds to current concerns. The world has always managed to mobilize and organize itself when facing difficult challenges or global threats. The challenge of climate change has led us to put our heads together and to take the decision to mobilize substantial resources.\nToday\u2019s open world will suffer more than ever from the consequences of poverty \u2014 in particular, uncontrollable and destabilizing migration movements \u2014 if nothing is done. Mass poverty has now become a major threat to humankind. It has become urgent to put in place a global programme to eradicate mass poverty, with the same determination that led us to hold the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That being so, from this rostrum I call on the most developed countries and the institutions that finance development to implement strong and collective action, with a view to eradicating poverty, which is dangerously sidelining the majority of African countries.\nThe international community has the capacity to do this, as it recently demonstrated when it prevented Greece and Ukraine from collapsing. That effort did not ruin the countries or the institutions that mobilized themselves in the rescue operation. To quickly and efficiently eradicate poverty and underdevelopment in Africa, that same will, but not necessarily more resources, will be required. Of course, African countries will need to assume their share of responsibility by doing more for political stability and, above all, for good governance.\nMy country Benin is committed to this approach and has initiated the necessary political, administrative and good-governance reforms. One can add to this nearly half a century of political stability as well as a mature democracy \u2014 all of these elements give Benin the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, provided that the country receives adequate support.\nI would like to state that my country is committed to contributing actively to the implementation of the decisions on climate change that were adopted during the Paris Conference. I note that Benin has already signed the Paris Agreement and the ratification process is ongoing. To conclude, I wish to reiterate that Benin remains committed within the international community to transforming the world with a view to achieving a shared well-being.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with the greatest pleasure, Sir, that I welcome you to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We in Saint Lucia are particularly pleased that the presidency has passed to a representative of a fellow small island developing State. I also take this opportunity to congratulate, through you, Mr. President, the Government and the people of Fiji on their gold-medal victory in the rugby sevens competition at the 2016 Olympic Games. I sincerely hope that our efforts during the early decades of the twenty-first century will help create a new world similar to the level playing field that enables athletes from small island States like ours to compete successfully with those from the super-Powers of the world.\nOn a personal note, it is an honour to address the Assembly as the eighth Prime Minister of Saint Lucia. I come before it humbled by the responsibility that the people of Saint Lucia have placed upon me and my Administration. We are mindful of the enormous challenges of our moment in history, and we are determined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity \u2014 at home and abroad. At home we have given our people a commitment to build a prosperous and progressive Saint Lucia for the benefit of all citizens. We are fully aware that we can succeed in that mission only with the support of those nations with which we interact.\nI have assumed office at a time when many around the world, like many in my own country, are discontented with the status quo. Theirs is a discontent with the ideologies, policies, institutions, and patterns of behaviour that were established in a time long past to deal with circumstances long gone. The old habits and old arguments are irrelevant and harmful to the finding solutions to the challenges faced by the people today. As a result, there is considerable frustration fuelling acts of terror throughout the world, which have escalated into major conflicts.\nWe recognize that it is through dialogue and mutual respect that we can begin to address long- standing conflicts. We therefore welcome the warming of relations between two of our neighbours and call on the United States to take the next step by lifting the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. A strong Cuban economy would strengthen the region in general.\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that we face many challenges within our international community. But the majority of our challenges are, at their most basic, symptomatic of a single underlying issue: the denial of access to basic human rights, including education, health care, justice and security. We must accept that those pillars are fundamental human rights and, as such, are the very foundation upon which our nations must grow. Our failure to provide and ensure those rights to our citizens in crucial areas of life breeds dangerous challenges that mushroom beyond national and regional borders and impact us all in the global community.\nWe leaders gather in this great Hall every year to engage in the general debate and deliberate on the challenges and successes of the international order. Yet the very format of the debate is problematical, given that while many speak, few stay around to listen, far less respond. Is it any wonder, then, how and why this entity is so negatively perceived by the persons who elected us to serve? As a small island State and Member of this body, our voice is meant to be equal, but long experience and realpolitik have proven the contrary. Instead of being invited to participate in finding a cure for the cause of our challenges, we are forced to accept remedies proposed by others to the symptoms of the maladies.\n16-29811 5/52 Given our small size and limited choices for economic expansion, small island States like my own have looked to the more advanced economies for innovative means of economic development. We have adopted programmes created by those States, such as the citizenship-by-investment programmes, financial services and trusts. Yet we find ourselves being penalized and criticized by the very architects of such programmes, as they brand us as tax havens and compromise our ability to grow our economies. We are therefore left to dance between the raindrops.\nA painful example of such exclusion is the inescapable fact that, while we continue to feel the negative effects of the 2008-2009 global financial and economic crisis, we are not involved in the solutions to the problems. As we know, the Group of 20 (G-20) has designated itself as the forum for our collective international economic cooperation. However, Saint Lucia, like the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, is not a member of the G-20, and we were not consulted on its appointment as the arbiters of our economic fate.\nThe G-20 also has a serious legitimacy problem. Aside from being unofficial and non-inclusive, many of the countries at the table represent the champions of the existing economic and financial systems and policies that led the world into the crisis in the first place. The crisis has produced increased poverty, suffering and social and political upheaval in our States. Its disproportionate impact on the poor has only widened the gap between developing and developed countries.\nThe current combination of the real impacts of global warming, the financial crisis and stagnant global economies has left many small island middle-income countries in a state of high debt and unemployment. And the new threat of de-risking will cause further deterioration in our economies.\nWhile we fully support the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and its ambition to deal with global warming, we are patiently waiting for its financing to be agreed. In the light of that, we wholeheartedly endorse the call by the Prime Minister of Jamaica for an initiative to assist highly indebted middle-income countries, underpinned by the principle that their structural vulnerabilities cannot be eliminated by diversification.\nEvery single Member State should be honest in shouldering its responsibilities. Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions. True leadership in this new world order demands much more. We must bring ourselves in tune with the call of the times.\nWe say that our destinies are interlinked, as we have all adopted a universal approach to sustainable development through the Sustainable Development Goals, but we still think in terms of a zero-sum game. The truth is that the world has been endowed with abundant natural resources, which, if put to proper use, could wipe out poverty throughout the world. There is therefore no need to continue to create a world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another.\nIn this Hall we come from many places, but we share a common future. No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the neglect of the work that we must do together. The magnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our actions. The United Nations was founded on the belief that the nations of the world should solve their problems together. It was rooted in the hard lessons of war and in the wisdom that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of holding steadfast to their insular policies. The time has come for the world to move in a new direction. The technological revolution of the twenty-first century is creating a new global village. We must embrace a new era of engagement based on common needs, innovative ideas and mutual respect. And that work must begin now.\nWe must decide whether the United Nations can continue to be a place where we continue our outdated grievances or a place we begin to forge common ground. We must decide to put less focus on what drives us apart and more emphasis on what brings us together. We must decide to give renewed meaning to the promise embedded in the name given to this institution, namely, the United Nations. Under my watch, Saint Lucia stands ready to collaborate more meaningfully with its neighbours in the emerging global village. We must adopt policies and programmes that put citizens and their basic human needs first. We must not accept easy fixes nor any solution that undermines the ability of any State to deliver on its promise to provide education, health care, justice and security to all its citizens.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, at this seventy-first session of the General Assembly, to congratulate, on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, President Peter Thomson on his election and to wish him every success. We hope that during his presidency our Organization will be able to address and resolve the major issues that affect our respective peoples and our planet as a whole, following on from the adoption in 2015 of the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\nMy delegation would also like to take this opportunity to pay homage to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his sustained efforts throughout his two terms of office to help our Organization grow and reinforce its role and action, focusing on peace, democracy and the protection of life in all its forms and elements.\nThe annual convening of the General Assembly can in many respects be interpreted by the people that we represent as an act of powerlessness, arising from the fact that the world continues to live in tension, with more than its fair share of indescribable suffering on a daily basis, as a result of past conflicts, new conflicts and poorly managed conflicts. At a time when the treatment of refugees fleeing war or hunger or both collides with populism and extremism, the democracies of rich countries appear to provide false responses to real problems, rendering them even more complex, stigmatizing and isolating our fellow peoples as simplistic slogans and reductive schemes increase divisions between peoples, civilizations and cultures.\nWe are pleased that the high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants was held here at Headquarters a few days ago. But the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, must do more to bring definitive settlements to the conflicts that are fuelling terrorism, the disappearance of States and the despair of populations. In this sense, we await the urgent adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nWe believe it to be essential that our Organization establish more binding mechanisms to ensure effective solidarity with the victims of war and terrorism and bring about solutions for old and recent conflicts, particularly the Israel-Palestine conflict and those in Syria and Libya, as well as the emergence of terrorist groups in the Sahel. Because of these conflicts, we are compelled to deploy a prevention policy to ensure that other issues of conflict do not arise. We must ensure on a permanent basis that States respect the integrity of human beings and the right to freedom of expression and to regular, just and transparent elections, and that post- conflict commitments are fulfilled by stakeholders.\nWe are pleased to witness the return of peace and the conclusion of the electoral process in the Central African Republic. We encourage support for the achievement of better conditions for the free and peaceful elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we reaffirm our commitment to the dialogue and consultations between neighbouring States in order to stabilize South Sudan, Burundi and Somalia. We also welcome the Colombian peace agreement and the rapprochement between Cuba and the United States of America.\nHumankind has always made genuine progress when peaceful coexistence and quest for solutions are prioritized, thanks to the opening of hearts and minds to differences, innovation, tolerance and respect for others. We strongly believe in our Organization as the ideal vehicle for bringing harmony to our world through respect for differences, cultures and government models and systems, as well as by constructing intelligent solutions based on cooperation and exchanges that generate wealth, prosperity and sustainable peace for everyone.\nThe role accorded to sustainable development at the two most recent sessions of the General Assmebly demonstrates the undeniable spirit of inclusion that drives us. However, it is clear that this belief in inclusion and the quest for sustainable development, peace and security cannot become a reality unless we reform our Organization. We must make it more credible, more effective, more efficient and more representative, in particular by ending a situation in which Africa is the sole continent without a permanent seat on the Security Council.\nMy country, Sao Tome and Principe, is a young democracy that has been functioning for almost 26 years. In August, it again held democratic elections, in which it elected its fourth President of the Republic. Despite being an island State, the second-smallest State in Africa and a State without mineral resources, we have nevertheless made remarkable progress in human development, with a school enrolment rate of over 97 per cent, an electricity coverage rate of over 60 per cent, an Internet penetration rate that is growing exponentially, one of the lowest rates of malaria in Africa and recognized advances in matters of governance and business climate. We are without a doubt on track to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\nAlthough the challenges of democracy and political stability are assured by the solidity of our institutions, the vibrance of our civil society and the good sense of our political establishment, Government and opposition alike, this does not necessarily translate to economic gain, particularly when it comes to long- term financing, which we need for the building of infrastructure in order to attract the private investment that will generate employment for young people and wealth and tax revenue for the State. This leads us to conclude that, when 60 per cent of the population is under the age of 20, there can be no lasting democratic gains unless there is economic growth on a sustained basis \u2014 a situation that cannot be ignored owing to its highly destabilizing nature in the event of failed development policies.\nMy Government has been doing its part by engaging in action, undertaking reforms and achieving results. Nevertheless, we invite developed countries to ensure that their commitments to sustainable development funding are fulfilled through, inter alia, the diverse mechanisms announced following the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development and during the twenty- first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. We also call upon multilateral financial institutions to increase their concessional lending.\nA universal push to transform our world depends principally on the mobilization of financial resources. The necessary financial windfall, capable of electrifying our continent, irrigating its fields, combating its endemic diseases, eliminating its hunger and promoting professional training, does exist. We see it every day in the capital markets and in the economic and financial press. Let us therefore act now. Access to development loans is the only response, and it will also help to relaunch the global economy with the necessary conditions for risk mitigation, good governance and the fight against illicit financial flows.\nAfrica, my continent, is lagging behind in practically all the human development indexes. This same Africa paid a heavy price for its contribution to the development of other nations for centuries. But let us not dwell on the past; let us instead exercise common sense and be expedient. Africa is still a continent of opportunity for all, with its mineral resources, arable lands, forest, rivers and, above all, its youth.\nThis year we will be called upon to elect a new Secretary-General, and this election must take place in ideal objective conditions in order to galvanize all the support needed to carry out this difficult but noble and vital mission of delivering peace and development to humankind.\nSao Tome and Principe reiterates its commitment to the international community and to working towards building a world that is better for everyone. May our hard work bear fruit.\n"

        "file_text": "More than ever, the world is confronting challenges that demand global solutions. Persistent, chronic conflicts, the scourge of terrorism, natural disasters, poverty, social exclusion and displaced populations are all challenges that we must approach in a sustainable and globally oriented manner.\nOur world is increasingly compelled to find inclusive solutions. We cannot enjoy peace and security without development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide us with a new opportunity and a universal impetus to transform the world. The SDGs set an ambitious programme of action for the years to come, aimed at eradicating extreme poverty, fighting for peace and security, combating inequality and protecting the planet.\nWe need to integrate the various strategies relating to climate change, development, humanitarian aid, the eradication of hunger, economic growth and peacebuilding. The political direction that we have set out for our social, industrial and agricultural policies will have an impact in one way or another on sustainable development. The experiences of the past show us that using purely isolated, sectorial policies will create more problems than solutions.\nIn Romania, we have launched the process of transforming the SDGs into national policies. We are concentrating on taking on environmental and climate-change issues in sector-specific policies, while also developing a comprehensive approach. We want to ensure the transition to a circular and green economy by specifically focusing on the good governance of natural resources and naturally protected areas, which cover 25 per cent of our territory.\nThe implementation of the SDGs and the transition to a green economy provide the only means of ensuring a sustainable, inclusive and decent life for our citizens. We believe that a cross-cutting approach to energy, environmental and agricultural policies, as well as climate issues, is essential in order to achieve the SDGs. For example, in the area of housing and energy efficiency, we recently adopted a programme to promote green technologies and materials. This year, we also adopted a national anti-poverty package that includes specific measures to fight social exclusion and help vulnerable children.\nDevelopment will become unsustainable if it is not inclusive in terms of both content and implementation. That is why we have invested significantly in open governance tools involving civil society and the business world.\nEvents in South-East Europe over the past two years have served to highlight complex security challenges in the vicinity of my country and are, without any doubt, responsible for the reversals in our progress towards sustainable development. The belt of frozen conflict zones around the Black Sea remains a serious, permanent threat to stability in the region and beyond. Prosperity and respect for the principles and norms of international law have been put on hold. We are deeply troubled by the use of hybrid warfare tactics and the illegal annexation of territories.\nThe growing instability in the Middle East, with Syria as the epicentre, is a major source of proliferating terrorism and massive migration. It is a threat not only to the region but to the entire world, and it must be addressed resolutely. We need to encourage reconciliation in the countries affected by instability by establishing policies aimed at promoting bridges between communities, while ensuring proper representation and inclusiveness. We must focus increased attention on post-conflict reconstruction strategies based on the Sustainable Development Goals and their Targets for Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen and continue discussions with all the stakeholders involved on the necessary institutional process and financial contributions.\nRomania is convinced that resolving the Israeli- Palestinian conflict is one of the most important tasks facing us; it could signal a turning point on the road back to stabilization and respect for fundamental rights, mutual acceptance and prosperity.\nMy country remains committed to the United Nations effort to maintain international peace and security. Romania has long been a contributor to United Nations peacekeeping. At present, Romanian military and police forces are taking part in ten United Nations peacekeeping operations and two special political missions.\nPeace and security cannot be sustained if the potential threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction persists, particularly nuclear weapons. Romania is currently chairing the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty Organization and has been clear in its condemnation of the nuclear and ballistic tests carried out by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea this year.\nI would also like to underline the importance of rethinking the relationship between humanitarian and development policies as an opportunity to find new solutions and responses. It is our responsibility to build on existing regional experiences and initiatives, some of which have emerged in the follow-up process to the Istanbul Humanitarian Summit. We need to move beyond sectoral approaches in trade policy; address climate change, hunger and poverty; ensure food production and economic growth; and find a more inclusive institutional framework to put forward integrated solutions. Romania is stepping up its effort to respond to those challenges in the spirit of international solidarity and responsibility-sharing and in accordance with our legal and moral obligations. Let me make three brief points to highlight our main lines of action.\nFirst, as an emerging donor and a country of resettlement, Romania has been working to expand its contribution to international humanitarian actions in recent years by increasing its resettlement capacity and financial assistance. Secondly, Romania continues to advocate for strengthening respect for international humanitarian law and constructive engagement in debates on possible ways to improve compliance. Thirdly, in its capacity as President of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime for the seventh session, Romania encourages greater accountability with regard to the implementation of the Convention\u2019s provisions on human trafficking and the smuggling of migrants, among other areas.\nOutrageous terrorist attacks have shocked the world this year, reminding us time and again that international terrorism undermines peace and security wherever it occurs. We cannot let terrorists take hold. Terrorist groups cannot be countered through military actions alone; we must also address the ability of such groups to attract recruits, particularly young people. We must eliminate the root causes that have allowed such groups to develop in the first place. Preventing radicalization is key, with action targeted on the underlying socioeconomic conditions of communities where individuals are most vulnerable to radicalization and recruitment. We need more effective communication and education tools.\nI commend the considerable progress achieved over the past few months in the fight against Da\u2019esh in Libya, Iraq and Syria. It is of the utmost urgency to deny them safe haven in other areas and by every means possible to stop the flows of foreign fighters from joining them. But that is only the first step. The liberated areas need reconstruction and stabilization.\nFor some time now, Romania has been promoting the idea that the response to terrorism requires multilateral action, based on international law. That is why Romania and Spain have suggested the establishment of an international court for acts of terrorism as a means of ensuring accountability for the horrific crimes we continue to witness.\nBefore concluding, I would like to express my appreciation for the outstanding contribution made by the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and for the active role he has played in strengthening the position of the United Nations in the international arena and promoting peace, stability and sustainable development. His leadership at the helm of the Organization has been an inspiration to numerous people around the world.\nMy country is committed to continuing to devote substantial political, diplomatic, human and financial resources to regional and global stability, in support of United Nations efforts in the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity. That is why Romania has announced its bid for a seat as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. I strongly believe that Romania\u2019s experience and solid track record in building bridges and trust among all Member States will make a valuable contribution to the Security Council\u2019s work.\n"

        "file_text": "First, on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, I extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. It is my firm belief that, with his wealth of experience, he will guide this session of the General Assembly with great success. We stand ready to offer him our full support and cooperation in the discharge of his noble duties.\nMy profound congratulations also go to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on the successful completion of his duties as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\nI also take this opportunity to commend His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his active and tireless efforts to fulfil the United Nations mission and objectives on many fronts over the past decade.\nThe international community remains concerned about various challenges and developments in many regions of the world. To name but a few, terrorism and extremism remain a threat to regional and global peace and security; more than 800 million people all over the world still live in extreme poverty; while natural disasters and climate change have inflicted tremendous damage on social and economic development in various parts of the world. At the same time, the global economy is still fragile and growing only slowly.\nAgainst that backdrop, in recent years the international community has made collective efforts to respond to and address those challenges by adopting various measures and mechanisms, including cooperation frameworks such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda for financing sustainable development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Programmes of Action for the least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.\nIn that regard, I am of the view that it is imperative for us to be resolute in translating our political commitment into concrete action, while enhancing mutual trust, cooperation and assistance in order to collectively address our challenges. We must continue to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations in resolving regional and international conflicts by peaceful means, while promoting development cooperation with a focus on implementing the 2030 Agenda. At the same time, the United Nations, which has a duty to encourage and assist Member States in implementing such measures, should improve its mechanisms and working methods to enable it to respond to challenges and carry out those duties effectively.\nSouth-East Asia continues to enjoy peace and stability, making for an environment that is conducive not only to the socioeconomic development of the countries of the region but also to enhancing regional cooperation in the new era of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Community \u2014 post-31 December 2015 \u2014 as well as strengthening cooperation between ASEAN and its external partners, with the aim of further consolidating and advancing the ASEAN Community in accordance with its Vision 2025 initiative through our ASEAN-initiated frameworks. We hope that the international community, particularly ASEAN\u2019s dialogue partners and other external parties, will continue to support ASEAN and its central position in the evolving regional architecture.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is proud and honoured to assume the chairship of ASEAN in 2016, the first year of the ASEAN Community. In that spirit, we have introduced the theme \u201cTurning vision into reality for a dynamic ASEAN Community\u201d, aimed at realizing Vision 2025. The ASEAN summits, and the related summits concluded earlier this month, have adopted many important documents related to cooperation within ASEAN and between ASEAN and its external partners. All of that has contributed significantly to our common cause of maintaining and promoting peace, stability and cooperation in the region and the world at large, as well as of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic takes this opportunity to express its sincere thanks and appreciation to the international community, particularly the ASEAN member States and dialogue partners, for the kind cooperation and support they have given our ASEAN chairship this year.\nThis has been the first year of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals. In that regard, I would commend the President on his choice for this session of the Assembly of the theme \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, a theme that responds to our real situation. I believe that we have to deepen understanding of the SDGs at the national, regional and international levels in order to integrate them into our national development plans and mobilize sufficient resources for effectively implementing the 2030 Agenda. We must also ensure a peaceful, stable environment, which is a shared aspiration for humankind and consistent with the United Nations principles of peace, friendship and development cooperation, aimed at ensuring that we, the peoples, live together in peace and dignity.\nEarly this year, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic held elections to the National Assembly, which subsequently approved a new Government. The Government has continued to pursue our policies on national development and has mainstreamed the SDGs into its eighth five-year national socioeconomic development plan for 2016 to 2020, its development strategy for 2025 and Vision 2030. We consider implementation of the SDGs to be an international obligation that will not only contribute to realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but will also bring development benefits to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. To that end, our Government is focusing on achieving the goals of the aforementioned development initiatives, which include, among other things, working on green growth and sustainable development, maintaining steady economic growth, continuing to reduce poverty and graduating from least-developed-country status.\nIn addition to the 17 SDGs, the Lao Government has adopted a national, eighteenth SDG \u2014 keeping lives safe from unexploded ordnance (UXO). I myself, together with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, formally launched the SDG on 7 September in Vientiane. Its targets are to ensure that residual UXO activities are undertaken by 2030 and all known UXO contamination is cleared in high-priority areas and all villages defined as poor; that annual casualties from UXO accidents are eliminated as far as possible; and that the needs of all identified UXO survivors and victims are met.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is a least- developed and landlocked country that continues to face many challenges and obstacles in developing infrastructure and quality human resources, among other things, that require the continued support and assistance of the international community. I am confident that with the Lao Government\u2019s determination, coupled with the international community\u2019s continued cooperation and assistance, we will be able to achieve those goals.\nClimate change and more frequent and severe natural disasters have affected the national development and livelihoods of peoples all over the world. That poses a major challenge that no single country alone is able to address. Recognizing the importance of this issue, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has formally joined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I very much hope that the Paris Agreement will enter into force by the end of this year and will be effectively implemented. For its part, the Lao Government has submitted its nationally determined contributions and integrated climate change, natural disaster risk reduction and management into its national socioeconomic development plan.\nLessons from the past have shown that the use of armed forces to resolve conflicts, which occurred in different regions of the world, brings only enormous devastation to humankind, such as great losses in lives and property, resulting in poverty, hunger and other negative impacts. This leads to an escalation of crimes and terrorist attacks. Against that backdrop, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic calls on the international community to demonstrate the political will to address conflicts in various parts of the world by peaceful means, which the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has consistently supported.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic always hopes that the parties concerned will resolve the issue of Palestine by peaceful means, with a view to creating two independent States, Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic welcomes the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, and expresses its strong hope that such relations will be further enhanced, leading to the lifting of the embargo against the Republic of Cuba in the near future.\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that the United Nations must be further strengthened, especially in terms of its effectiveness in addressing important global issues. All States Members of the United Nations should extend full support and cooperation and fulfil their international obligations in order to address these enormous global challenges, and in particular to implement the SDGs in a timely and effective manner. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic reiterates its firm commitment and determination to continue working closely with the international community to build a more secure, peaceful, just and prosperous world.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I pledge Ukraine\u2019s full support for all of his endeavours.\nIn one of the worst years of the twentieth century, Ernest Hemingway wrote an inspiring humanistic novel. In the epigraph to the novel, he quoted the English poet John Donne:\n\u201cNo man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the continent, A part of the main;\n... Any man\u2019s death diminishes me, Because I am involved in mankind\u201d.\nThese words embodied the essence of the moral and historical transformation that humankind underwent in the wake of the two world wars of the twentieth century.\nWe entered the third millennium with a strong, new sense of being united, as a humankind for which there is no such thing as \u201csomeone else\u2019s pain\u201d. What has happened to this feeling? Where has it gone? Where has the drive to isolate oneself on an island come from? Why is it that new politicians come to power on various continents calling for ignoring someone else\u2019s pain? Why is it that a cynicism not seen since the time of Hemingway\u2019s novel has settled into our lives under the guise of pragmatism? What makes evil so strong and good so weak nowadays?\n\u201cNo man is an island\u201d \u2014 this is also about those in power.\nThis is also about our Organization.\nToday the world is experiencing greater and greater instability. Some have been affected more, some less. But never since the end of the Cold War have international norms and principles been unilaterally defied on such a scale and with such brutality. The Charter of the United Nations, the document underpinning our responsibility for maintaining the world order, has never before been questioned. And never before has a Security Council member been a major violator of the United Nations Charter while at the same time being the instigator of, and an active participant in, a conflict, as well as its mediator.\nAs a result, global instability is no longer the subject of academic debate but is actually the greatest threat facing humankind nowadays. Our future, the future of our children and our Organization, depend directly on how we manage to overcome this threat.\nI see only two ways out of this situation: either we recognize the problem and spare no effort to address it on the basis of shared values and principles, or we deceive ourselves with the illusion of stability, turn a blind eye to obvious facts and leave the future of the United Nations \u2014 this unique platform for common action \u2014 at the mercy of one player that blatantly violates the United Nations Charter.\nIf we choose the second option, we will soon experience severe disappointment.\nThe price for this short-sightedness has long been known: it is human lives. In the last century, humankind paid an enormous price following the two World Wars: about 70 million lives. Is that not enough?\nHence, I wish to reiterate that we can no longer afford to have the Security Council deadlocked on key issues of international peace and security. Limiting the use of the veto power in decision-making on conflict prevention and resolution should become a priority task in the context of Security Council reform. The suspension of the use of veto in cases of mass atrocities, as well as in cases in which a Security Council member State is a party to a dispute, should become a rock-solid rule, without exceptions. The Council must become a truly democratic and representative body free from the relics of the past.\nThere is a critical need to make our Organization capable of addressing effectively acts of aggression and of bringing those responsible to justice. Otherwise, no nation, no State Member of the United Nations can enjoy sustainable security and development.\nAnother threat to international peace and security that requires the urgent attention of the world community is hybrid wars. As President of a State that has become a testing ground for new methods of hybrid warfare, I have already drawn international attention to this threat at the previous session of the Assembly.\nOver the past year, the practice of hybrid warfare has only spread. Its effect has been seen across all of Europe, the United States of America and beyond. Political pressure, blatant propaganda, interference with the electoral process, economic coercion, secret subversive and military operation, cyberattacks, misuse of diplomatic measures \u2014 these are modern unconventional methods of undeclared war. It is time for the Security Council to work resolutely and effectively on this issue. Ukraine is ready to further discuss what the Council can do to tackle this threat, and how it can do so.\nIn view of the recent developments on the Korean peninsula, the future of the nuclear non-proliferation regime is a cause of increased concern for my country. As is well known, Ukraine voluntarily dismantled its own nuclear arsenal \u2014 the third largest in the world at the time, with between 2,800 and 4,200 tactical nuclear warheads \u2014 in exchange for security, sovereignty and territorial integrity assurances under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Regrettably, all these assurances remained exclusively on paper. Let me be frank: we failed to pass the exam with the Budapest Memorandum. The democratic world lost its first battle at that time. It was not only about Ukraine, but also about the credibility of all agreements.\nHowever, Ukraine, as a responsible international actor, has always been and remains a committed advocate of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Thus, the timely and effective action of the international community \u2014 the Security Council in the first place \u2014 in response to the North Korean nuclear test is one more exam for all of us. We must not allow the world to plunge into a new nuclear arms race. Huge global instability and ever-growing security challenges increasingly demand strong leadership both in States and in international organizations. The United Nations is no exception.\nThis year, we will appoint the next Secretary- General. I believe that the candidate for this important position, in addition to his or her highly professional skills, must be uncompromising on respect for the Charter of the United Nations and ready to decisively use all tools at his or her disposal, including those provided under Article 99 of the Charter, in case of a threat to peace and security. We expect that both the Security Council and the General Assembly will make the right choice. Ukraine, as a current non-permanent member of the Security Council, will work consistently to this end.\nThis year, we have witnessed a gruesome series of terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Burkina Faso, Turkey, Belgium, France, Germany and Ukraine. This list is unfortunately not even complete. The tentacles of terrorism are wrapping themselves around more countries and continents. It is obvious that such a large-scale threat can be confronted effectively only through joint efforts. In this context, the protection of crucial infrastructure from terrorist attacks should become our joint endeavour. Banking and finance, telecommunications, emergency services, air and railway transportation, and energy and water supply will all be put at risk. Even worse, terrorist attacks may claim numerous victims among civilian populations.\nWe will continue calling for the Security Council\u2019s action in response to this growing problem. In this regard, we welcome the initiative of the United Kingdom to convene a Security Council ministerial meeting to discuss terrorist threats to aviation security (see S/PV. 7775). This should be a powerful signal that the Council is ready to act resolutely to prevent future tragedies \u2014 tragedies such as the downing by terrorists of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-17 over the Donbas two years ago.\nThe scrupulous technical investigation carried out by an international team made it possible not only to uncover details but also to put together the whole picture of this horrible crime. Now we have to ensure the proper implementation of the Security Council resolution 2166 (2014), regardless of Russia\u2019s shameful veto of the decision to establish an international tribunal under the aegis of the United Nations. The joint team \u2014 composed of representatives from Malaysia, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium and Ukraine \u2014 continues the criminal investigation. We must set up an efficient mechanism to bring to justice all those responsible for this catastrophe. Our moral duty is to ensure that not only the perpetrators but also the masterminds of this crime, whose orders killed 298 innocent people, are punished appropriately for what they did.\nSince 2014, Ukraine has learned from its own tragic experience what foreign-grown terrorism feels like. The terrorist component of the undeclared hybrid warfare that Russia has waged against Ukraine is evident. Dramatically, it has become a daily routine in the occupied areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. For over two years, Ukraine has received extensive and irrefutable evidence of the direct involvement of Russia, its State agencies and officials in financing, sponsoring, and coordinating terrorist groups that have committed countless crimes against my compatriots.\nThe shocking reality is that there is an illegal military force of roughly 38,000 in Donbas, and a large part of that is irregulars and mercenaries from Russia. This force is armed to the teeth by Russia. That is no exaggeration. They have at their disposal some 700 tanks, 1,200 armoured vehicles, more than 1,000 artilery systems and more than 300 multiple-launch rocket systems. Russia keeps sending weapons, ammunition and manpower to Ukraine through the uncontrolled part of the Ukrainian-Russian border by road and by rail on a daily basis.\nAt the same time, the Russian side continues to insist at all forums, including here at the United Nations, that it has nothing to do with all of this and that the Russians are not in Ukraine. No. They are there and even hypocritical Soviet leaders could hardly compete with the outright lies and manipulations deployed by the Kremlin today. Yes, they used to threaten the world with the use of nuclear weapons, just like Russia is doing now. However, when shown the United States intelligence aerial photos, even Khruschev could not but recognize that the Soviet missiles were stationed in Cuba. Today, in response to thousands of available photos, videos, satellite images, eyewitness and other evidence of the Russian military presence in Donbas, Russia only repeats over and over again its cynical recitation: \u201cWe are not there\u201d.\nRussia used to say the same about Crimea \u2014 \u201cWe are not there\u201d \u2014 and then a sham referendum was conducted at Russian gunpoint. A few days ago, a contradictory statement by the Russian President that Crimea was annexed in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. This is hard to imagine. Are we really refering to the same Charter? This is not merely disrespect for the centuries-old principles of international relations, written and unwritten legal and ethical rules. This is a downgrading of diplomacy as such.\nI believe that it is time for our Organization to work out serious safeguards against abuses of trust of the world community by some United Nations Member States.\nIt is necessary to elaborate mechanisms to officially document evidence of the aggression of one country against another and to assign clear responsibility to the aggressor, in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThis is the third year that the aggression against my country continues to bring pain and suffering to the Ukrainian people. Some 2,430 people have been killed, a significant number of them over the past year. The total death toll this year in this war inflicted on us at the heart of Europe has amounted to 2,500 members of the military and 7,500 civilians. All together, 10,000 people have been killed. Hundreds of hostages remain in unlawful captivity in Donbas and in Russia.\nI was shocked to learn that Russia-backed illegal armed formations in the occupied areas of Donbas recently took children as hostages. They showed a video of the interrogation of the teenagers, whom they absurdly accuse of conspiring and carrying out subversive operations. This behaviour is out of place in the twenty-first century. We call on UNICEF to intervene and prevent the abuse and torture of these children.\nAnother heartbreaking story is one from a few days ago. One Ukrainian hostage volunteer, Volodymyr Zhemchugov, was eventually set free. After one year in captivity without proper medical assistance, this completely blind man without hands said the words that are the quintessence of what is happening in Donbas.\n\u201cI am a native of Donbas, I am an ethnic Russian, a former miner. But people like me in Donbas, patriots of Ukraine, were not fooled by Russian propaganda. We started to resist Russian occupation, to resist the country that set off the war against Ukraine.\u201d\nHowever, he expressed the strong belief that soon peace would be restored in his native land, Donbas, and that people will return to their normal life.\nIn this regard, I would like to emphasize once again that Ukraine remains committed to the settlement of the situation in Donbas by political and diplomatic means. We are a peaceful nation. It was never, under any circumstances, our intention to start any conflicts with our neighbour. Over the past year, we have consistently demonstrated in deed that we are ready to move forward on implementation of the Minsk agreements, the comprehensive peace plan agreed in September 2014 and confirmed in February 2015.\nYet, we have constantly faced the resistance of the Kremlin and its proxies, who do their best to delay the peace process and to shift responsibility for their own destructive actions onto Ukraine. We rely on Russia to abandon this approach to give a chance to the comprehensive settlement. Let me stress again that the Minsk documents entail, by and large, clear guidelines for each side on what must be done. Ukraine has done a lot and will continue doing its part. Now it is time for Russia and its proxies in the Ukrainian Donbas to start implementing their part. Set the captives free, stop shooting, withdraw weapons, let the inspectors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe carry out their mandate and watch over the Ukrainian- Russian border without any objection or any hindrance, and withdraw Russian weaponry and regular and irregular military units.\nThe occupying State does not limit itself to combat actions in Donbas only. It also carries on its repressive policy in Crimea. Once thriving and free, now the Crimean peninsula has become a grey zone where people are effectively deprived of all protection. The judicial and penitentiary systems in Crimea have been converted by Russia into a tool of repression. As has been already the case so many times in history, most of the victims are Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.The latest addition to this picture is the ban by the Russian occupation authorities on the activities of the Mejlis, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatar people. Add to this the arbitrary detention of Ilmi Umerov, Deputy Head of the Mejlis, in a psychiatric facility for 20 days. In fact, the outrageous practice of punitive psychiatry, which had been widely used by the Soviet repressive machinery, is now back in service for Russia.\nWe urge Russia to grant unimpeded access to international human rights organizations, both in Crimea and Donbas, and to implement the decision of the UNESCO Executive Board on establishing monitoring in Crimea at the institutional level. The residents of the peninsula must be protected from discrimination and repression. The genocide of the Crimean Tatar people, who already experienced the tragedy of forced deportation 70 years ago, must not be repeated.\nIn Ukraine, we highly appreciate the contribution of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Council to addressing the current human rights situation in my country, including in occupied Crimea. This year, we intend to bring this matter to the attention of the General Assembly and to submit a relevant draft resolution on the human rights situation in the territory of the occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. This draft resolution will become an impartial assessment of the human rights situation in the occupied territories by the entire United Nations family.\nPeople in these territories have the right to be protected. Their children have the right to be protected. And it is our responsibility, as the United Nations, to protect them. I appeal to all Member States of the United Nations to support the initiative of Ukraine. We also urge Member States not to recognize the legitimacy of the Russian elections that were held a few days ago in the occupied Crimea. If they do recognize them, it will play into the hands of the aggressor and encourage further repression.\nOne more problem arising from Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea is its intentions to deploy tactical nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in the occupied peninsula. This would destroy the global system of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and brutally violate Ukraine\u2019s non-nuclear status. Moreover, Russia uses temporarily occupied Crimea to project its aggressive policies not only in Ukraine, but also in other corners of the world, including in Syria, where these policies go hand in hand with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Today, the entire democratic world is deeply concerned over the human rights violations and dire suffering of the civilian population in Syria.\nI believe that the full implementation of the 2012 Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/522, annex) and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) is vital for the settlement of that protracted and bloody conflict. We draw particular attention to the need to remove the threat of the use of chemical weapons in this country. Our urgent priority is to improve the humanitarian situation and ensure the access of the international humanitarian organizations to Aleppo and other cities in need. We welcome the special meeting of the Security Council on Syria this morning (see S/PV.7774), where I had an opportunity to express our views on this important issue. I hope that this discussion will lead to meaningful decisions and tangible steps towards alleviating the plight of Syrians and bringing about peace.\nAfrica is yet another continent that continues to suffer from numerous unresolved conflicts and requires our particular attention. It should finally be seen for what it really is \u2014 a continent with untapped potential and opportunities for the rest of the world rather than the burden it was for decades, after centuries of colonialism and exploitation. My country will spare no effort to support the African continent, and our African partners can fully count on Ukraine, including within the Security Council.\nDespite the ongoing challenges facing Ukraine, my country is fully committed to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the General Assembly last year. We will continue to work to fulfil our SDG commitments at the national level, particularly those related to ensuring a healthy environment and a sustainable energy supply, promoting gender equality and fighting corruption. As a member of the Friends on Climate Change group, Ukraine contributed to reaching consensus on the universal agreement on climate change. We completed the ratification procedures for the Paris Agreement in a very short time and deposited our ratification instrument during today\u2019s high-level event.\nThis year, we also reached an important milestone, the completion of the United Nations Action Plan on Chernobyl, as well as the end of the Decade of Recovery and Sustainable Development of the Affected Regions. However, there is a clear need for continued international efforts to mitigate the impact of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and complete the various projects.\nI am pleased to note that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development addresses migration, currently one of the world\u2019s biggest problems. In recent years, we have witnessed unprecedented mass movements of refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs). It seems hard to imagine, but today there are roughly 65 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, including more than 21 million refugees, 3 million asylum-seekers and 41 million internally displaced persons. Unfortunately, those IDPs include some 1.8 million of my compatriots who have fled the Donbas region, which has been occupied and devastated by Russia.\nUnquestionably, our main responsibility is saving our people\u2019s lives and protecting those in need. However, to come up with a comprehensive response to\nthat global challenge, we must address its root causes. They include, first and foremost, armed conflict, terrorism, sectarianism and poverty. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which the Assembly just adopted as resolution 71/1, is a first step in that direction. My Government is committed to protecting its IDPs and has taken important measures to strengthen its national response mechanisms, paying special attention to ensuring that IDPs have the means to live, as well as improving their access to health care, education, housing and employment.\nSeventy years ago, Winston Churchill, one of the founding fathers of the United Nations, said at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri:\n\u201cOur difficulties and dangers will not be removed by closing our eyes to them. They will not be removed by mere waiting to see what happens; nor will they be removed by a policy of appeasement.\u201d\nThose words have not lost their relevance today. Churchill\u2019s vision of the United Nations as a vital sinew of peace and an essential policy foundation for international relations that must confront the two giant marauders, war and tyranny, acquires a new reading for our times. He called for us to\n\u201cadhere faithfully to the Charter of the United Nations and walk forward in sedate and sober strength seeking no one\u2019s land or treasure, seeking to lay no arbitrary control upon the thoughts of men\u201d.\nI hope that approach will continue to be a powerful guide for all of us. Moreover, it is the only possible way to preserve our unique Organization and save the world from a new global catastrophe.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, in his address in this Hall, His Holiness Pope Francis defined the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as \u201can important sign of hope\u201d (A/70/PV.3, p. 4). Just a few days ago, he reiterated his appreciation for the actions taken last year by the United Nations, encouraging all to put those ambitious objectives into practice. and saying that\n\u201c[t]he protection of our common home requires a growing global political consensus. Along these lines, I am gratified that, in September 2015, the nations of the world adopted the Sustainable Development Goals and that, in December 2015, they approved the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which sets the demanding yet fundamental goal of halting the rising of the global temperature. Now Governments are obliged to honour the commitments they made, while businesses must also responsibly do their part. It is up to citizens to insist that this happen and indeed to advocate for even more ambitious goals.\u201d\nThe achievement of the 2030 Agenda involves an important assumption of responsibility on the part of Governments and the commitment of all, for the common good. This commitment entails recognizing the need to strive not only for great macroeconomic goals but for outcomes that are specific, lasting and equitably distributed. Without a stable financial situation, lasting investments and a commercial appraisal that favours internal growth, however, the 2030 Agenda will be impossible to achieve. Pope Francis has emphasized that\n\u201c[e]conomics and politics and society and culture cannot be dominated by thinking only of the short- term and immediate financial or electoral gains. Instead, they urgently need to be redirected to the common good, which includes sustainability and care for creation. One concrete case is the \u2018ecological debt\u2019 between the global north and south. Repaying it would require treating the environments of poorer nations with care and providing the financial resources and technical assistance needed to help them deal with climate change and promote sustainable development.\u201d\nWe always must remember that development \u2014 especially integral human development \u2014 cannot be imposed. Men and women, as individuals, must be the principal agents of the 2030 Agenda. Last year, in this very Hall, Pope Francis affirmed that\n\u201c[t]his presupposes and requires the right to education ... which is ensured first and foremost by respecting and reinforcing the primary right of the family to educate its children, as well as the right of churches and social groups to support and assist families in the education of their boys and girls.\n\u201c[f]or all this, the simplest and best measure and indicator of the implementation of the new agenda for development will be effective, practical and immediate access, on the part of all, to essential material and spiritual goods: housing, dignified and properly remunerated employment, adequate food and drinking water, religious freedom and, more generally, spiritual freedom and education\u201d (supra, p. 4).\nSuch a process of bringing about integral human development \u2014 a concept that includes but is not exhausted by economic development \u2014 should, through multilateral initiatives, stimulate also the quest for complementary, alternative finance systems capable of ensuring that financial resources are both accessible to and sustainable for the poorest.\nAs Pope Francis said here last year,\n\u201c[the] pillars of integral human development have a common foundation, which is the right to life,\u201d (ibid., p. 4)\nand we are required to\n\u201crecognize a moral law written into human nature itself, which includes the natural difference between man and woman and an absolute respect for life in all its stages and dimensions\u201d (ibid., p. 5).\nMoreover, integral human development is impossible without peace. Only two days ago in Assisi, Pope Francis, together with numerous other world religious leaders, stressed the importance of dialogue as a privileged way to becoming peacemakers. Conflicts not only render the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals at the regional level absolutely impossible, but also destroy so many human resources, means of production and cultural heritage. Today, as during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, there is the recurrence of the threat of nuclear conflict with its terrible consequences.\nThe enormous and ill-fated effect of war is a downward spiral from which there is often no escape. It triggers increased political polarization at the global level and narrows the spaces in which the same international community can propose effective solutions for a stable and lasting peace.\nAmong the factors that degrade social coexistence in countries and undermine the whole international community we must count the scourge of terrorism. In the course of recent years we have seen terrorism metastasize to so many parts of the world. Neighbours of Syria and Iraq have increasingly become the victims of innumerable barbaric acts. Beyond the Middle East, atrocious acts of terrorism have introduced fear into the daily lives of so many across the globe.\nIn the Middle East we see the terrible consequences of the spiral of war: many lives destroyed, failed States, collapsed ceasefires, unsuccessful peace initiatives and failed attempts to resolve the fundamental causes of conflict in Syria, Iraq and Libya, find a solution to the presidency crisis in Lebanon, or resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That persistent failure has dampened the hopes and promises of all who consider the region sacred and holy.\nWe can also witness those failures in the long- standing conflicts that continue to oppress and take the lives of so many in South Sudan, the Great Lakes and for two and half years now in eastern Ukraine. Although those situations have all been high-profile and have led to an immense amount of human suffering, we remain very far from resolving the root causes. It almost seems that we have accepted conflict, war and terrorism as a part of normal life.\nBeyond the urgency of the need for ceasefires, respect for the dignity and the rights of affected peoples and access to humanitarian aid, it is also necessary to facilitate negotiation among those with direct or indirect responsibility for particular conflicts. Thankful for the positive outcome in Colombia, the heartfelt hope of the Holy See is that, through facilitation efforts on the part of the international community, various forms of contact and dialogue will be pursued to resolve ongoing conflicts.\nIn particular, from the beginning of the conflict in Syria, the Holy See has invited all of the parties to dialogue and the international community to spare no effort in facilitating an end to violence and in promoting conditions conducive to a dialogue aimed at finding a political solution. Syria, however, has been overrun by all kinds of armed groups. The uproar of arms must cease so that peace may stand a chance and, above all, so that humanitarian assistance may be brought to those most in need. The Holy See is convinced that this is possible, provided that there is the political will to bring an end to the fighting.\nDespite the present difficulties, one can still gratefully find in Lebanon the conviction that common good requires the participation and cooperation of all sectors of society, based on the rule of law and the idea that institutions are founded on respect for the innate dignity of every human being. The Lebanese constitutional arrangement, in which diverse ethnic groups, cultures and religions are an asset and contribute to a peaceful coexistence, can also be a model for a political solution in the region.\nThe Holy See also believes that in the Middle East a renewed commitment in favour of the rule of law and the freedom of religion and of conscience is the most effective way to safeguard the dignity of all. In that context, the 2015 global agreement signed by the Holy See and Palestine, which was subsequently ratified by both parties, sets out in law defence of the most basic human rights, among which are freedom of religion, the right to peaceful assembly and the freedom to publicly profess one\u2019s religious beliefs. In the complex situation of the Middle East, in particular in Iraq and Syria, the Holy See maintains that the global agreement with Palestine can serve as a template for other countries with analogous social structures.\nIn the context of the renewed efforts to relaunch the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, the Holy See renews its appeal to both parties to abstain from any unilateral or illegal measures whatsoever, which may constitute an obstacle to the search for peace and advancing the two-State solution.\nWhen we look at the phenomenon of forced migration, we find ourselves before a population of people on the move greater than that of many of the States represented here: 65 million people have been compelled to flee from their homes and communities because of persecution, conflict, widespread violence and hunger, and devastated lands. A word of praise must go to Lebanon and to Jordan for the hospitality they are offering to all who have escaped from war and destruction in Iraq and Syria, as well as to Turkey, which is hosting millions of Syrian refugees.\nBeyond the necessary urgent consideration of how to resolve the causes of that forced exodus, we must note that migration and development are tightly linked. The consequences of the mass movement of refugees and migrants threaten to weaken our commitment to the values of solidarity and hospitality towards those in need. Those values stand at the heart of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy to which Pope Francis has been summoning the world. As Pope Francis has emphasized,\n\u201c[m]ercy is the fundamental law that dwells in the heart of every person who looks sincerely into the eyes of his brothers and sisters on the path of life\u201d,\nespecially those who are the weakest and most vulnerable. Drawing special attention to those who are in prison, the Pope has renewed his pressing appeal\n\u201cto the consciences of leaders, that they come to an international consensus aimed at abolishing the death penalty\u201d.\nWithout authentic and absolute respect for life, there can be no development that is truly human, integral and sustainable. Precisely to foster that development, Pope Francis has instituted a new dicastery, or department, of the Holy See, the purpose of which is to promote justice, peace, the safeguarding of the environment and care of those most in need. The poor and needy are the human face of sustainable development that we wish to keep ever before us, so that we may become responsible agents of a more just and truly human society.\n"

        "file_text": "Cameroon wishes to congratulate Mr. Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. His great experience at the national and international levels, and in the public and private sectors, and his well-known personal qualities augur well for the success of our work. I would like in that regard to assure him of the support of my country and the full cooperation of our delegation. I would also like to recognize the work accomplished by his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose term of office was characterized by successful initiatives to make the United Nations more open and transparent.\nFinally, I would like to pay special tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his remarkable accomplishments during his two terms in a particularly difficult international context. Cameroon, for its part, was honoured by his memorable visit in 2010. It welcomes the strengthening during his term of our exceptional bonds of excellent cooperation with the United Nations.\nThis session opens at a time of turmoil in which, fortunately, we see some glimmers of hope. In a spirit of human solidarity, we have in recent years laid the foundations for a common destiny for humankind. I am particularly referring to the document significantly entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, adopted at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 (resolution 66/288, annex). I would also refer to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Finally, I must mention the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, prepared at the twenty- first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nIn that context, my country welcomes the President\u2019s decision to place his term under the banner of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We therefore welcome the convening of this debate on the Sustainable Development Goals, nine months after their adoption and entry into force. The SDGs, it should be recalled, constitute the first global agenda to consider the issue of development in all its dimensions \u2014 security, economic, social, human and environmental.\nThe originality of the 2030 Agenda clearly lies in the fact that it transcends the conventional indicators of economic growth. It truly focuses on human progress, humanity\u2019s heritage, the common well-being and security for all. It is an ambitious Agenda that requires everyone\u2019s genuine involvement. Under the Agenda, our common goal is to eradicate poverty and to leave no one behind. That is a challenge that we have set for ourselves and that we must assume in solidarity in order to meet the expectations of our peoples and take the summons of history to heart.\nAs everyone knows, we have in the past adopted agendas, declarations and action programmes that have raised great hopes around the world among young people, women and men, both urban and rural. They were harbingers of a new world of peace and shared prosperity. Yet the adopted actions were only partially implemented, a situation that we regretted at the time. In this Hall, we have failed to honour all our commitments, especially the financial ones. We have not fulfilled all the hopes and aspirations of our peoples.\nToday, we need to get organized so as to ensure that the Sustainable Development Goals fare better. Since the goal is to transform our world and leave no one behind, we must find the wherewithal to realize our ambitions, which fall into three categories. First, there is the political: our political will must be constant and not wax and wane according to circumstances. Secondly, in the financial category, our contributions should be effective, certain and adequate. That will require unprecedented mobilization. Lastly, from a moral perspective, the principle of the duty of solidarity among peoples should be reaffirmed and observed. In doing so, we will be helping the SDGs to accelerate the advent of a world of peace for everyone everywhere \u2014 a world of prosperity for all.\nAs the Assembly knows, it is no longer time for promises. It is time for commitment; time for action. Our efforts will encounter various obstacles, including persistent conflicts and increasing terrorism. My country is in a position to talk about that, having been engaged over the past three years in a veritable war against the scourge of terrorism. That new type of threat to peace and development requires, I repeat, a collective response, collective determination and collective action. Goal 16 of the Agenda for Sustainable Development, which focuses on the promotion and the advent of peaceful and inclusive societies should, in our case, help us to effectively fight Boko Haram.\nAs underscored by one of the targets of that Goal, we should\n\u201cstrengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime\u201d.\nCameroon wishes to thank the President for having invited us, along with the other States Members of the United Nations, to today\u2019s debate on the implementation of the SDGs, the new universal push to transform the world. The outcomes of previous agendas and programmes have shown us the urgent need to find the wherewithal to achieve our ambitions. If we decide, here and now, to effectively and tangibly mobilize our immense resources and if we decide to devote them to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, then the SDGs will truly become the push to transform today\u2019s world into a world of peace and shared prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, we, all together, pledged to improve various conditions facing humankind and to protect our natural habitat. Under the theme \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, we have now convened at the seventy-first session of the General Assembly to assess the progress and to deliberate on current and emerging challenges in the overall pursuit of the underlying objective of passing a better world on to our children and grandchildren.\nI congratulate you, Sir, and the people of Fiji on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and we rely on your vast experience to successfully conduct the affairs of this session in the furtherance of the hopes that we share for a better world. In the same vein, I commend His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, under whose able leadership the affairs of the seventieth session were conducted, including the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe wish to recognize, in a special way, the innovative and creative leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has energized the international community\u2019s collective pursuit of the noble objectives of the United Nations. We acknowledge, with profound gratitude, his stewardship, which brought a paradigm shift in development programmes within the United Nations system. It ushered in the new global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which envisions a world without poverty, a world of shared values and responsibilities, a world of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and a planet saved through effective mitigations of threats \u2014 in effect, a world that leaves no one behind. As the Secretary-General\u2019s tenure ends later this year, I would like to him to know that his actions and innovations have inspired us all. He has our very best wishes for success in his future endeavours.\nWe congratulate and welcome the International Organization for Migration (IOM) into the mainstream of the United Nations, particularly at this time when the world is facing the daunting challenge of a massive migration and refugee crisis. We anticipate cogent inter-agency dialogue and collaboration between the International Organization for Migration and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in facilitating the voluntary return and reintegration of refugees and displaced persons. We call on the two agencies to forge an effective response to the issue of migrant-smuggling and human trafficking, bearing in mind that women and children are the main victims of organized crime and modern slavery.\nThe call for the reform of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, rings louder in the deafening silence from some quarters. The equity that we promote through our commitments at the United Nations must be respected by all of its bodies. We urge the big and powerful nations of the world to bring that long silence to an end.\nThis session is taking place at a time when there is an escalation of conflicts engulfing millions of people in many parts of the world. We note with particular concern the rise of international terrorism, extremism, xenophobia and violence, which continue to pose a threat to global, political, social and economic stability. The unabated crises that we continue to witness in the Middle East, on the continent of Africa and in other parts of the world are a challenge to the noble objectives of the United Nations. The mass displacement and suffering imposed on the people of Syria, who are forced to migrate far from their homeland, is a blight on the conscience of the world and questions the resolve of the United Nations.\nThe current state of our world, conditioned by the realities of insecurity, requires collective, concerted action to avoid unacceptable levels of deprivation, poverty and human suffering. At our subregional level, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has demonstrated its commitment and preparedness to combat terrorism in Mali, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Nigeria, as well as in other parts of the subregion, with valued support from partners in the international community. We are optimistic about the regional initiatives and collaborations launched by the African Union, ECOWAS and the United Nations that aim to help consolidate peace and security on the African continent. The ECOWAS initiative to bring peace to Guinea Bissau, the African Union efforts in Mali and South Sudan, and the Lake Chad Basin Commission\u2019s efforts to combat Boko Haram and other terrorist groups show progress and clearly demonstrate the relevance of regional solidarity.\nWith a view to strengthening peace and security within ECOWAS, we have emphasized the fight against organized crime, especially cross-border trade in illicit small arms and light weapons, drug and human trafficking, and piracy. As the current Chair of ECOWAS, I can confirm that we are unwaveringly committed to continuing our efforts to achieve integration through infrastructure development, trade and investment, natural resource management, food security, and peace and security with renewed vigour.\nLiberia maintains its confidence in the ability of the United Nations as the most viable body in the search for global peace and security. Liberia reaffirms its commitment to supporting the United Nations in its endeavours to achieve world peace and security, democratic governance and the advancement of the universal principles of human rights. We reiterate our commitments to addressing extreme poverty, empowering women and girls, and bringing marginalized communities into mainstream society and making their voices heard. Those are the drivers of our transformational push to save our nation and our world.\nSince our conflict ended in 2003, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has worked with Liberia, first to institute and then to consolidate security, peacebuilding efforts and governance gains in the country. I am pleased to report that the drawdown of UNMIL was successfully executed on 30 June, when Liberian security agencies assumed full responsibility for the security of our nation and people. We recognize the risks involved, given our severe fragility and the scarcity of resources, but we take up those responsibilities with confidence in the knowledge that our partners are still with us.\nI am proud to have served as a Co-Chair on the Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Global Sustainability, which initiated the process culminating in the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Liberia has embarked on its process of domesticating the SDGs through robust nationwide consultations and dialogues with major stakeholders, including the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, the private sector, civil society and faith-based organizations. With the support of our United Nations partners, we are formulating a road map to achieve full integration into our national development agenda.\nWith 43 per cent of the biodiversity in the West African region, Liberia is mindful of the need to protect the environment from the effects of global warming and climate change. Our commitment to sustainable land and forest governance and management remains firm, as our establishment of a legal verification mechanism and an enforced regulatory framework reflects. Our partnership with Norway has been helpful in that regard.\nAs a resilient and determined nation that has faced the challenges of several periods of devastation, Liberia is rising again. We are determined to walk the agreed road to the achievement of our Vision 2030, and to successfully conclude the first five-year phase of our Agenda for Transformation. Our democracy, stalled by years of conflict, stands firm as we march towards its most challenging and important task: the conduct of presidential and legislative elections in 2017.\nOn behalf of the people of Liberia, I thank the United Nations for helping us to preserve peace over the past thirteen years. I also thank the many international partners who have been with us on the road to recovery.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the seventy-first session. I wish to assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support in the successful discharge of his important responsibilities. I also want to commend the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his effective leadership at the seventieth session.\nI wish to place on record Nepal\u2019s admiration of His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the dedication with which he served this world Organization for the past 10 years. We wish him well for the future.\nExactly six decades ago, at the eleventh session of the General Assembly, Nepal first spoke as a newly admitted Member. Now, 60 years down the road, our commitment to the United Nations has become even stronger. The principles of the Charter of the United Nations remain at the core of Nepal\u2019s foreign policy. As much as the United Nations has contributed to our development endeavours, and lately to the peace process, Nepal has significantly contributed to the United Nations in fulfilling its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security.\nIt has been a year since we adopted the universal and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with the objective of leaving no one behind. After one year, it is clear now that much more needs to be done to move from commitments to results. Let me stress the fact that the secure foundation of world peace rests on the well-being of the peoples across the globe. Poverty reduction and sustainable development are therefore inseparable. We cannot imagine a peaceful, prosperous and secure society when millions of people live in poverty. I therefore urge all Member States and our development partners to move beyond rhetoric and commence concrete actions without losing time, energy or zeal.\nIt is also evident that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be realized unless sound development policies and frameworks are supported by a capable institutional framework, adequate resources and innovative methods of implementation. As much as national commitment, ownership, leadership and people-centric governance are critical in the domestic context, robust international partnerships are equally important to ensure the success of the SDGs. We would like to see progress in terms of the principal components of the resource base \u2014 official development assistance, trade, foreign direct investment, technology and debt relief \u2014 to ensure the smooth implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nNepal\u2019s commitment to the SDGs is informed by its success in reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Amid multiple challenges, Nepal\u2019s performance in that respect was impressive. We were able to halve the proportion of people living in poverty and to significantly reduce the maternal and infant mortality rates. We were able to send more children to school and keep them in school. The enrolment of girls in schools was substantially increased. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is now part of our national development plans and programmes and will be implemented with the utmost priority.\nThe vision for a safer world continues to elude us. New sources of threats to humankind have emerged, while the traditional sources of threats have simultaneously become more pronounced. The forms and intensity of non-traditional threats to security \u2014 terrorism, transnational crimes, ethnic tensions, intra-State conflicts and violent extremism \u2014 have multiplied. The abuse by criminal actors of innovations in information and communications technology has added to social vulnerability. We underline the central role of the General Assembly and the Security Council in addressing such threats and challenges.\nThe increasing terrorist activity in our own region and in many parts of the world is a matter of serious concern for all of us. Terrorism is a serious threat to the human goal of living in harmony, peace and dignity. Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The failure of the international community to agree on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism is highly frustrating. We call upon the international community to muster the much- needed political will to accomplish this agenda.\nTo create a secure world we must adopt a two- track approach. We must deal with emerging threats resolutely, firmly and collectively. On a much broader scale, we also need to nurture a culture of peace. As the birthplace of Lord Buddha, Nepal believes that meaningful exchanges and dialogues among civilizations will help instil positive values, which will contribute to eventual world peace.\nWe would like to see an early resolution of the conflict in Syria. The suffering of the Syrian people must now come to an end. Nepal supports the call for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We recognize the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to an independent State, based on United Nations resolutions, and the right of every nation in the region to live in peace, within secure and recognized international boundaries.\nNepal stands for the complete and time-bound disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear ones.An environment must be created in which development dividends can be released by disarmament and redirected towards productive use. The global community, especially the nuclear States, must make a determined effort to move forward from the stalled negotiations on disarmament. We believe that all efforts to bring about disarmament must be pursued in good faith and in full compliance with the agreed international regimes. Based on our principled position, Nepal hosts the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific. We invite Member States and partners to support and fully utilize the Centre to promote dialogue on disarmament, thereby enhancing the Kathmandu process.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are an important innovation of the United Nations and are dedicated to the service of humankind. Nepal\u2019s engagement in peacekeeping operations, started just three years after joining the United Nations, speaks volumes about our unflinching commitment to the cause of international peace and security. We feel proud to be part of that flagship contribution. Our troops have served in various challenging peacekeeping missions with a high degree of professionalism, commitment and devotion. That has helped them earn international acclaim. Seventy-three of our fellow countrymen have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to the supreme cause of peace. We remain steadfast in our commitment to fulfil our obligations and are prepared to provide additional troops and civilians to United Nations peacekeeping operations. That is because we have a strong conviction that the success of the United Nations largely hinges on the success of its peacekeeping operations.\nHowever, we also believe that for the peacekeeping missions to be successful, there must be unity of purpose in mobilizing all of the political capital of the Security Council. We must establish clearly defined mandates and operational modalities, provide adequate resource back-up, ensure the safety and security of personnel, arrange regular consultations and greater collaboration with the troop-contributing countries and devise clear exit strategies.We also believe that peacekeeping alone cannot guarantee durable peace in societies. It should be complemented by proper and clearly defined peacebuilding strategies led and owned by the people and societies themselves. We would also like to underline that all troop-contributing countries must be afforded fair opportunities to serve in leadership positions, both in the field and at Headquarters, commensurate with the level and length of their contributions.\nWe are satisfied that human rights values have now become truly global. Human rights must not be used as a tool to serve hidden political interests. All human rights, including the right to development, must receive equal priority and be pursued even-handedly. The salient features of non-selectivity, universality, indivisibility and objectivity must be upheld in all circumstances. The sanctity of the Human Rights Council and the innovative universal periodic review mechanism must be maintained to ensure the full ownership of human rights.\nNepal\u2019s commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms is total and unwavering. We are party to most of the core international human rights instruments, which have found eloquent expression in Nepal\u2019s newly promulgated Constitution. The new Constitution of Nepal, which was the result of eight years of deliberation that ensured participatory, transparent and inclusive processes, includes an impressive list of human rights and provides adequate remedial measures. Nepal has abolished the death penalty and is a party to the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has put in place the necessary legal, institutional and administrative measures for the realization of all human rights.\nThe National Human Rights Commission and other independent constitutional bodies were established with the sole objective of protecting and promoting human rights in all spheres of national life. Nepal\u2019s homegrown peace process recognizes transitional justice as its key component. The Commission on Investigation of Disappeared Persons and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are carrying out their mandates in an independent and impartial manner. The Government is committed to taking appropriate measures to address the issues surrounding the process of transitional justice in line with our international commitment and the ground realities of establishing sustained peace.\nNepal has been working closely with the Human Rights Council with all sincerity and commitment. Informed by our experience of protecting and promoting of human rights and our sincere desire to contribute to the work of the Human Rights Council, we are seeking membership on the Council for the term beginning 2018. It is the first time we have filed our candidature. We request the support of all fellow Member States for our candidature.\nMigration has become a defining phenomenon of the contemporary world. The global movement of people has brought benefits and challenges. The proper management of migration can contribute to the economic growth and development of both the destination and the origin countries of migrant workers. The welfare and the protection of the rights of migrant workers must therefore receive priority in the countries in which they work. As the source country of over 3 million migrant workers, Nepal calls for concerted efforts at the national, regional and international levels to ensure that the process creates a fair and win-win situation for all.\nDespite not being a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, Nepal has long hosted refugees on humanitarian grounds. International burden-sharing has greatly helped to lessen the burden host countries face. However, the right of refugees to return to their homeland in safety and dignity must always be upheld in all circumstances.\nWhile globalization has created many opportunities, the benefits which countries have reaped from it have been uneven. The constraints on countries in special circumstances, particularly the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, are real. That is why international financial, trading and monetary systems must be responsive to their needs and concerns. Robust implementation of internationally agreed commitments, including those contained in the Istanbul Programme of Action, the Vienna Programme of Action, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, are critically important to enable those countries to emerge from the states of poverty and underdevelopment they are experiencing. Delay in the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations is a huge setback; it is denying countries many development dividends of trade and hampering the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nAs to climate change, Nepal, as a Himalayan country, faces challenges in the form of melting glaciers and flash floods from glacial-lake outbursts. We believe that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, adopted last year, reflects a rare commitment by the international community to making a difference. We support its early entry into force. Nepal also believes that climate justice based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should be at the centre of its implementation. Special attention must be given to the climate-vulnerable countries, particularly mountainous countries, as regards providing resources and transferring technology for capacity-building and adaptation. Our efforts must recognize the intrinsic connection between poverty reduction, sustainable development and environmental protection.\nWe must acknowledge that the United Nations system has a leading role to play in global governance. Equal emphasis must be laid on all three pillars of the United Nations: development, peace and security, and human rights. The reform of the United Nations must reflect the vastly transformed political reality of the twenty-first century. Our vision for sustainable peace and a just world order cannot be realized without a comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including reform of the Security Council. Nepal strongly believes in a more representative, inclusive and accountable United Nations.\nIn recent years Nepal has undergone a political transformation of historic proportions. The decade-long armed conflict was finally converted into a peace process with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006. Commitment to democratic norms and values was the central thrust of the peace process, which led to the holding of the first-ever elections for the Constituent Assembly. Arms management and the integration of combatants was successfully carried out as part of the peace process. With the promulgation of the democratic Constitution on 20 September last year, the peace process basically came to a close.\nNepal\u2019s homegrown peace process and its success may provide a good model for countries transitioning from conflict to peace. The promulgation of our Constitution represents a turning point in Nepal\u2019s constitutional and political history. Among other things, the Constitution aims to institutionalize inclusive and democratic polity, pluralism, the rule of law, representative and accountable government, social and economic justice and universally accepted human rights.\nEquality is at the core of the Constitution. Equal opportunity and protection are guaranteed to every citizen. Discrimination on any ground is prohibited. The State is obliged to take special measures to protect the most marginalized and underrepresented sections of society and ensure their well-being. Our Constitution is not a rigid document, but rather a living and dynamic one that is capable of addressing any remaining or new issues within its framework. The two amendments that were made within months of its promulgation amply prove this.\nWe are currently engaged in dialogue with concerned political parties to find an acceptable solution to some of the issues where differences persist. The Constitution guarantees equal participation and incorporates the principle of proportional representation of women, indigenous nationalities, Madhesis, Dalits and other marginalized groups in elective bodies and other organs of the State structure. Nepal has a strong commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Women are guaranteed a minimum of one third representation in the federal and provincial parliaments, and 40 per cent in local government. I am proud to inform the General Assembly that in Nepal the Head of State, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Speaker of the Parliament are all women.\nWe have entered a crucial phase in implementing our Constitution in Nepal. Our ultimate goal is to consolidate peace and stability and bring about prosperity in the country. Inclusive economic growth and development are important to sustain political gains. The Constitution provides a framework to pursue those objectives. Democratic elections for all three tiers of the federal system must be completed by February 2018. That is a huge task, but we are determined to carry it out successfully, thereby helping to institutionalize the federal democratic system of governance, as promised by the Constitution. Further tasks include addressing the outstanding issues of the peace process, reconstructing and rebuilding earthquake-ravaged areas and achieving inclusive prosperity and development; they constitute our top priorities.\nAs we embark upon the effective implementation of the Constitution and undertake the vital process of the socioeconomic transformation of Nepal, the goodwill, solidarity and support of the international community become all the more important. We are confident that our friends in the international community will stand by us in our efforts to build a strong foundation for a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous Nepal.\nThe United Nations today is confronted with unprecedented challenges. However, unique opportunities also exist \u2014 and can be seized to transform the world into a peaceful place in which to live. We have the capacity, resources and technology to address the challenges and ensure prosperity and dignity for everyone. But we must muster the necessary political will to achieve that. Let us make a solemn commitment here in the Hall of the General Assembly that the world of tomorrow will be different from that of today. We want the history of the twenty-first century to unfold not as a history of conflict, strife, poverty, hunger and indignation, but as a history of prosperity, peace, development and partnership.\n"

        "file_text": "\u201cWe want a future in which everyone lives a happy life and loves one another\u201d. Those words were recently written in the Book of Ideas by a six-year-old boy named Lovro when he visited my office along with a number of other children to mark the beginning of the new school year in Croatia. But they could easily have been written by any child in the world. It is a simple, yet powerful, wish. In order to transform our world, we as leaders must listen to Lovro\u2019s words. And for that reason I want his voice to be heard today in the General Assembly. Everyone can agree that those simple truths, among which are the right to a happy life and the freedom of choice, as universal drivers of\na better world, are indeed the ultimate objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nA year has passed since we adopted the milestone Agenda 2030, and we are now one step and one year closer to its deadline. Today, in terms of achievements and responsibilities, I would like to address sustainable development by focusing on human potential, natural resources and resilient societies.\nWe have all signed onto the Agenda, our plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. People should be at the heart of our efforts, with youth at the very core. Our goal as leaders is to empower our youth through education and give them opportunities to be the catalysts of transformation and progress. Now is the time to start viewing our youth as the guardians of Agenda 2030, because in 14 years whatever progress we have achieved will be theirs to carry on.\nI would agree with many who argue that even today, in 2016, we must decide whether we opt for open or closed societies. Whatever we do to safeguard the future should be done with determination, with clear choices in mind.\nThere is much work to be done. We must begin by restoring public confidence in Governments and international organizations. We must embrace our common values with strength, courage and true conviction \u2014 beginning with tolerance \u2014 and become active and dedicated builders of a world where there is no room for despair.\nTrue inclusiveness means more than just being open to cooperation and raising awareness from time to time. It should be a continuous search for consensus, nationally and internationally, and the active involvement of all stakeholders in building new strategic alliances. There is an evident need for ending the prevailing silo approach, if we are to achieve synergies when implementing mutually interdependent goals. Security, prosperity and human rights go hand-in-hand and cannot be separated.\nAccording to the latest UNICEF statistics, over 50 million children are currently uprooted, and almost 60 million children do not have access to primary education. Those children are counting on us to give them the chance they deserve. We should not act only when moved by images, such as those of the Syrian boys Aylan and Omran, which are true symbols of our world gone horribly wrong.\nThe optimism and resilience shown by children and, most of all, their unbridled honesty are qualities that I respect and admire. All children should have the right to their childhood and education. It is devastating to know how many children could not begin class this autumn because they are victims of the various global crises that we allow to persist.\nIn terms of unlocking global human potential, I believe that if we want to give future generations a chance for a better life by 2030, we must address three main, mutually reinforcing, phenomena: large-scale migrations, demographic dynamics and youth unemployment. We need a predictable, humane, responsible and legally sound system of governing international migration. Croatia commends the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), which the General Assembly adopted on Monday, as well as the Agenda for Humanity presented at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul last May. Implementing them together with Agenda 2030 will help us address the root causes of the large movements of people. On that issue we need not minimize anyone\u2019s dignity or rights, nor underestimate the perils that surround them.\nOur immediate focus should be two-fold. We must provide assistance to both the countries of origin and the receiving countries in order to promote safe, regular and orderly migration management. We must promote global efforts to counter organized-crime networks involved in human trafficking. What we have is a global crisis of human mobility and, as such, it requires a global response.\nWe must end the policy of double standards and the hypocritical approach to the tragedy that is unfolding as we speak. We must help those who have managed to leave the fields of destruction, but we must also do our utmost to assist those who have stayed behind and are left with no means of or strength to escape.\nAll societies, developed and underdeveloped alike, are currently facing not only one generation, but several generations, of youth that are unemployed, disappointed and discouraged, while others are trying to escape from conflict, violence and intolerance. They are extremely sceptical about their future and become easy prey for all kinds of manipulation and radicalization.\nSocial media and modern communications technology are becoming a double-edged sword. They provide us with unparalleled opportunities, making the world interconnected in ways that only yesterday few dared to dream of. At the same time, they carry the dark potential to spread hatred and intolerance and build invisible walls around those who look or think differently. We must pay special attention to that possibility and find the prudence to use new technologies to improve not only our daily lives, but also our hearts and minds.\nEducation, knowledge and tolerance are more than just the tools of choice when dealing with political and social discrimination, exclusion and the prevention of violent extremism and terrorism. They are the way forward. They are the key to success and are fundamental drivers of sustainable development.\nConstant investment in education systems always pays back with big dividends. Ever more countries are recognizing the necessity of a comprehensive education reform, because too many current education systems are generating youth who cannot find employment. Education has the power to multiply opportunities. It is an engine that creates choices, providing every individual with the freedom to choose a path of his or her own.\nGender inequality is the most pervasive form of global inequality and a pressing human rights concern. Women and girls continue to be exposed to a range of obstacles to their complete and full inclusion in social, economic and political life. There will be no real progress without a gender-responsive implementation of Agenda 2030. For us to succeed we need more women in politics and business, in diplomacy and on executive boards. But that will not happen without men. Their role in the empowerment of women, their support and understanding, are as crucial as the will of women to succeed.\nThis year, Croatia is chairing the Equal Futures Partnership \u2014 an innovative multilateral initiative aimed at encouraging Member States to empower women economically and politically. The high-level meeting of its members and supporters will take place tomorrow. I invite all those present to find the time to pay due attention to that endeavour.\nNature is just as irreplaceable as people are. Development strategies must seriously take into account our natural resources as the fundamental starting point. Climate change is a powerful weapon of mass destruction that is going out of control. We have very little time to reverse that self-destructive course. Climate change is also a risk multiplier for other security challenges, including large-scale migrations and regional instability born out of hopelessness and desolation. We must ensure climate action and make sure that the recent Paris Agreement enters into force as soon as possible.\nAs a country on the northern shores of the Mediterranean, Croatia is following the developments across that cradle of our civilization with care and deep concern. The southern Mediterranean has, sadly, become a sea of dangerous journeys, where the legendary tales of the classical world are being replaced by new stories of human suffering, where ancient monuments are being reduced to dust and where indifference to human life sometimes reaches an unimaginable scale. The stability, security and well-being of the Mediterranean remain a priority of Croatian foreign policy.\nOur societies are exposed to a complex global security environment with increased mutual dependencies. There is a whole range of hybrid threats to national and international security: violent extremism, terrorism, foreign terrorist fighters, uncontrolled migration, organized crime, risks related to the cyberenvironment, and the malicious use of new technologies. Large-scale migrations and unemployment are interconnected, just as failed States and fragile Governments are related to conflict.\nTerrorism continues to represent not only a security concern, but also a detrimental economic factor for every country, causing millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety and prosperity. We need to strengthen the resilience of our societies at the grass- roots level, particularly the fabric of multicultural and multi-confessional societies, against terrorist propaganda, attempts at violent radicalization and other extremist actions. In addition to our efforts to promote sustainable and long-term de-radicalization and fight terrorist narratives, especially those in cyberspace, we need to address the underlying socioeconomic drivers of terrorism, such as poverty, inequality, unemployment, the lack of education and the lack of economic prosperity.\nWhen countering global threats that impede the emergence and growth of resilient societies, the issue of disarmament must remain at the forefront. Recently, we achieved success in the development and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions. At the same time, large parts of the United Nations disarmament machinery are stalled. The 2015 Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains a case in point. In our quest for a more secure global community, we must spare no effort in the field of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nTwenty years have passed since the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was opened for signature, but we still need to invigorate our determination to become a nuclear-test-free world. New technologies and the fourth industrial revolution are changing our lives for the better in more ways than one. However, they also have a negative impact on security and disarmament. Technologies such as 3-D printing are changing the algorithm in the area of conventional weapons, and the misuse of cyberspace might have unforeseen consequences in the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear areas. We must therefore broaden our reach when it comes to disarmament topics and align it with new realities.\nCroatia considers participation in international missions and operations to be a principal duty that can contribute to peace. In that regard, we are preparing to place the Croatian Army Engineering Horizontal Construction Company at the disposal of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nToday, on the International Day of Peace, it is necessary to emphasize that women are powerful agents of peace and security. We must not treat women only as victims of conflict and violence. Women are powerful agents of change. Their growing contribution to the prevention and resolution of conflict, as well as to the maintenance of a sustainable and inclusive peace, should be encouraged. More female peacekeepers could help us combat sexual violence, promote gender awareness among the host nations\u2019 populations and improve relationships with local citizens. In order to contribute to that goal, Croatia is conducting a United Nations training course for women police officers from Asia, Africa and Europe. The course is organized back- to-back with predeployment military training in order to enhance the synergy between the military and civilian sectors by integrating the gender and multicultural aspects of peacekeeping.\nWe commend the Secretary-General for advancing the responsibility to protect. Over the past 10 years, a lot has been accomplished in building consensus around that concept and strengthening the will and capacity for its implementation. Croatia advocates the further strengthening of the role of the International Criminal Court so that it can assume greater responsibility in prosecuting mass atrocities and war crimes, including criminal acts against cultural heritage committed by State or non-State actors. We believe that it is of paramount importance to put an end to the culture of impunity. And that must be done without any politicization, without putting daily politics above the rule of law and, certainly, without rewriting or misinterpreting history.\nIt is through hard-earned wisdom that we lave learned that there can be no true justice without peace or peace without justice. Establishing individual accountability through strong evidential and legal norms is essential. International tribunals and judicial mechanisms can lay the foundations needed to make the voices of victims heard and to record volumes of evidence in the annals of history, but it is up to each society to bring the process of reconciliation to its end.\nRespect for, and the protection of, human rights is a prerequisite for sustainable peace and development. Our work in that area should never end. We strongly support and advocate the Human Rights Up Front initiative. Through its candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2017-2019, Croatia looks forward to constructively contributing to and strengthening the Council\u2019s work in the promotion, protection and further development of human rights.\nCroatia will continue to be actively engaged in the United Nations reform process. We commend recent progress in the process of electing the next Secretary- General and strengthening the Office of the President of the General Assembly. However, the Organization is still lagging behind in terms of what is expected concerning Security Council reform, as highlighted by the number of ongoing, prolonged and nascent crises in the world. We have great expectations for the next Secretary-General. We hope that she or he will give bold impetus to the processes of carrying forward our Organization, making it even more effective, accountable, transparent and, above all, more relevant.\nThe world has been yearning for inspirational and effective leadership. The solidarity of our global society is deteriorating as problems pile up and hope diminishes. Will we accept that we are creating a world led by feelings of separation, fear and cynicism because we have allowed violence, injustice and crises to prevail? Or will we reverse those trends and choose to achieve a better tomorrow?\nFourteen years from now, our children will not ask us what we planned together or what we signed up to do. Instead, they will ask us what we achieved together and whether we made a difference. And we as leaders need therefore to inspire our citizens again and act together today.\nI want to end with a message to all of the children in Croatia and in the world: their voices provide us with guidance and serve as an obligation for all of us who gather here at this permanent meeting point of humankind. Lovro may only be 6 years old, but his voice resonates today in the General Assembly Hall, and he is making a difference.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a plan of action for balanced and sustainable global development. The Agenda puts all peoples at the heart of development policy and aspires to give them equitable access to opportunity, progress and prosperity, while leaving no one behind. Such a transformative Agenda represents a crucial paradigm shift in the United Nations development agenda, which seeks to be more inclusive and more responsive to new challenges.\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of Thailand\u2019s membership in the United Nations. It is also the first year of the implementation of important agendas, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The international community must therefore join hands and hearts so as to ensure that those agendas are implemented effectively.\nThailand firmly believes that sustainable development cannot take place where there is no peace and security or when human rights are violated, abused or disregarded. We also hold the opposite to be true \u2014 that peace and security is unsustainable without development or when people are deprived of their rights. The three United Nations pillars are therefore truly interconnected and mutually reinforcing. The recent migration crisis is a clear example of just how intertwined the security, development and social dimensions are. No country is immune from the effects of crises happening in other parts of the world. It is therefore our shared responsibility to address all challenges at the root-cause level in order to derive sustainable solutions.\nToday we face multilayered and interconnected challenges. Addressing them, as well as finding universal solutions to them, is made all the more complex because of the diversity of the world\u2019s 7 billion people in some 200 countries, with their different beliefs, histories and cultures. The international community should therefore work closely together to find ways of achieving peaceful coexistence based on mutual understanding and respect, as well as shared responsibility, where everyone is given opportunities and basic rights in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner. We must also ensure full respect for, and compliance with, our international obligations, especially those whose breaching could have serious consequences, such as obligations concerning nuclear disarmament.\nIn order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we must take on shared responsibility and put in collective efforts, as well as promote the active engagement of regional, political and economic groupings. No single country, even the most powerful or prosperous, can go it alone in that regard. International cooperation \u2014 be it North-South, South-South, or triangular \u2014 is therefore essential and can be the universal push we need to transform our world.\nThis year, Thailand has the honour of serving as the Chair of the Group of 77 (G-77). Our stated objective has been to transform vision into concrete action. We have therefore been coordinating and bridging the Group\u2019s position with other groups and partners, so as to enhance mutual trust and promote common interests. This year, for the very first time, Thailand, as the chair of the G-77, was invited to the Group of Twenty (G- 20) Summit, held in Hangzhou, where we took part in discussions on how to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That was an important and historic moment for the G-77, because the G-20 is a grouping of the world\u2019s major economies.\n26/30 16-29503 Additionally, Thailand has shared its experiences and lessons learned in overcoming socioeconomic challenges through His Majesty the King\u2019s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as an alternative development model that takes a people-centred approach and emphasizes moderation, reason, resilience, virtue, knowledge and inclusiveness. That Thai model has so far been applied and adapted to fit the national context in over 20 developing countries.\nSince assuming the G-77 chairmanship, Thailand has initiated the SEP model for the SDGs partnership programme as a platform for the exchange of views, experiences and best practices among members on issues such as investment and information and communications technology for development. We have also learned about homegrown approaches to development from one another through bilateral and trilateral cooperation arrangements \u2014 for example, with our development partners.\nThailand stands ready to promote further cooperation with all groups, such as the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa group and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which also attach great importance to sustainable development. We will also strengthen existing regional mechanisms so as to give further impetus to efforts to transform our world. Next month, Thailand will host the second Asia Cooperation Dialogue Summit to discuss, among other things, the implementation of SDGs in the region.\nAt the ASEAN-United Nations Summit in Vientiane earlier this month, the Secretary-General spoke about the important role played by regional mechanisms in the promotion of international peace and sustainable development. All ASEAN leaders, including myself, believe that the efforts that we will be making to achieve the SDGs will be key factors in the transformation of our world for the better.\nThe ASEAN Community is now in its first full year. It has brought the peoples of ASEAN closer together, in particular through our economic and cultural links. We see that closer cooperation will also help to reduce conflict and further promote peace within the region.\nThe Thai Government attaches great importance to achieving sustainable development. We have established the National Committee on Sustainable Development and incorporated the SDGs into our twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2017-2021 and our 20-year national strategy. We are continuing with our policy of providing quality health-care services for all, as well as ensuring equitable access to education for all, whether they be Thai nationals, migrants or foreign workers. To that end, we can count on the Government\u2019s universal health coverage programme as well as other initiatives, such as the anti-microbial resistance campaign. We also have a compulsory education programme to ensure basic education for all.\nMoreover, the Government places high importance on raising living standards, protecting freedoms, reducing disparities and promoting equitable access to basic services. We have reviewed the relevant national laws and regulations with a view to achieving tangible and sustainable results in those areas. We have enacted new legislation on gender equality and have taken measures to protect at-risk and vulnerable groups, including newborn children, persons with disabilities and the elderly. We also provide adequate housing and land distribution to low-income earners, because we believe that those people, if empowered and protected, can be valuable assets and important agents of change in our universal push to transform our world.\nOn the issue of climate change and the environment, Thailand has ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We call on other countries that have not yet done so to become party to the Agreement at the earliest as a show of our joint commitment, solidarity and shared responsibility in addressing that issue, which affects all of humankind, especially small island developing States.\nWith regard to our economy, the Thai Government is implementing the Thailand 4.0 programme, which employs technology and innovation as driving forces for targeted and sustainable economic development in such sectors as agriculture and industry. The programme emphasizes education, infrastructure, research and development, and also creates incentives and an enabling environment for the private sector through improvements in business laws and regulations, so as to be able to fight corruption. We believe that such an approach will help overcome the middle-income trap and allow our people to participate fully in the country\u2019s future.\nOn peace and international security, Thailand has consistently supported United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations. Our peacekeepers have participated in some 20 missions and have contributed to enabling local people to live normal lives, play a part in strengthening their own societies and participate in the long-term development of their countries. Those efforts are also consistent with achieving SDG 16, on peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.\nThailand fully supports the effective implementation of SDG 17, on strengthened international cooperation and global partnership. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all model for development, since each country has its own specific needs and limitations. Therefore, we need to make the appropriate adaptations so as to fit the context of each country by sharing of experiences and best practices, with a view to achieving unity in diversity.\nThe Thai Government has laid down the foundations for sustainable development. On 7 August, the Thai people voted to approve the draft Constitution in a democratic referendum. At present, constitutional by- laws are being considered that will lead to the holding of general elections in late 2017, in accordance with our road map. That referendum reflects the genuine intentions of the Government to promote the democratic process, while taking into account the views expressed by the international community. The Government came in to oversee the transition period and restore order and security. Once the situation returned to normal with security restored, the Government ended certain temporary measures, such as by lifting, last week, the military jurisdiction over civilians.\nThe Government remains actively engaged in addressing long-neglected and deeply rooted problems of security, corruption, human trafficking and crime. We believe that addressing the root causes of such problems can serve as a strong foundation for sustainable democracy and good governance, with the hope that Thailand and the Thai people will remain constructive members of the global community in the long term.\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts throughout the past decade. He has been the man behind many important and commendable initiatives driving change and progress in the international community \u2014 for example, the Human Rights Up Front initiative and the Agenda for Humanity. I wish him all the best in his future endeavours.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Republic of Paraguay, I congratulate Ambassador Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at this session. I wish him every success and assure him of my delegation\u2019s support.\nWe also acknowledge Ambassador Mogens Lykketoft, who helped keep the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the heart of our deliberations and initiated, after 70 years, a ground- breaking process of openness and transparency in electing the next Secretary-General, which will be an important milestone in the history our Organization.\nI also take the opportunity, on behalf of President Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, to commend Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless work during the past 10 years, his humanity and his commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We are confident that his legacy will live on and serve as an inspiration to the next person to assume the responsibility. On behalf of the Paraguayan people, I reiterate our appreciation for his historic visit to the Republic of Paraguay.\nWe live in an increasingly complex and interconnected world with an international context that is constantly evolving. Traditional armed conflicts have nearly disappeared, but terrorism in its most cowardly and intolerant form has reached global dimensions and is characterized by the emergence of increasingly cruel and inhuman groups that scorn human life and lack any respect for rights and fundamental freedoms. The effects of climate change and pollution continue to worsen, and pandemics threaten our planet.\nThe global challenges that transcend physical borders and to which no State is immune cannot be confronted individually. It is therefore essential to promote collective, comprehensive strategies, based on shared responsibility. Furthermore, we cannot lose sight of other priority challenges such as eradicating poverty, reducing inequality and ensuring a life of dignity for all.\nWe are saddened and concerned about the situation endured by refugees and migrants in various parts of the world. The scale of the refugee crisis should lead us to think, not only of responses to their most pressing needs, but about the importance of resolving the root causes that have led these people to flee their homes and embark on perilous journeys in which they face terrifying uncertainty.\nToday, given the new and complex contexts, the main purposes of the United Nations \u2014 to find solutions to the international problems in the economic, social, cultural and humanitarian spheres and to promote respect for human rights \u2014 have not lost their relevance. On the contrary, they are more compelling than ever. However, the Organization requires reform that brings it up to date and helps it to come up with appropriate and effective responses.\nThe General Assembly must be strengthened. It is the highest expression of the democracy of the countries that constitute it. Sovereign equality is the cornerstone of its structure. It is the Parliament of the world. We believe that this year, given the public hearings that have taken place with the candidates, men and women alike, we have taken an important step in strengthening its role and in increasing transparency in the process of selecting the next Secretary-General. Paraguay would like a Secretary-General who attaches priority to preventive diplomacy and mediation and who, as\nthe main person responsible for the administration, will ensure that the system of the United Nations exemplifies inclusion and promotes national diversity and gender balance in its staff.\nReform should also encompass our executive branch, the Security Council, the body in charge of maintaining international peace and security. We need a more democratic and representative Council with more space for developing countries \u2014 a Council that is transparent, inclusive and accountable for its actions. I would like to mention that Paraguay aspires to be a member of that body from 2028 to 2029. The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to international law and multilateralism. Unilateral action in international relations only negatively affects the weakest countries.\nA fundamental pillar of peaceful and harmonious coexistence among States is the peaceful use of nuclear energy. We advocate for such energy programmes, developed with full precautions so as to limit the degradation that its products can cause to the environment. States that carry out such programmes should do so on the basis of broad, cross-border responsibility. They should follow best practices based on international cooperation, prevention of the risk of damage, and due diligence, responding appropriately to possible cross-border damage.\nAll nations of the world are called upon to prevent threats to peace and to adopt appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace, especially with regard to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. Collective and responsible action is necessary in order to address the various situations that endanger the lives and security of civilians and that affect the political stability of entire countries and regions.\nParaguay reaffirms its willingness to continue contributing to the personnel of peacekeeping operations. Today, there are Paraguayan personnel deployed in seven of those operations. The Republic of Paraguay strongly condemns terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations and stands in solidarity with victims and the suffering caused to them and their families by terrorist acts. Last month, our country suffered a criminal attack that killed Paraguayan military personnel in the performance of their duties. We are grateful for expressions of solidarity from the international community, and we reaffirm our commitment to the struggle against terrorism in the framework of international law and with full respect for human rights and international humanitarian law.\nOur Government, founded on traditional relations of friendship and cooperation with the Republic of China on Taiwan, appeals for that country to have an enhanced presence in the agencies and programmes of the United Nations system.\nPoverty and inequality are drivers of political instability. They degrade the social fabric and condemn the most vulnerable to a life of exclusion and want. The historic promise embodied in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to eradicate poverty everywhere and if possible forever, within 15 years, is, therefore, unprecedented in history. With that in mind, my country\u2019s Government is implementing inclusive development plans and programmes for the progressive realization of the economic and social rights of our citizens and in doing so works to improve their quality of life, which in turn will contribute to strengthening our democracy.\nThe sustained economic growth of Paraguay in recent years and the implementation of its social protection strategies have made it possible for thousands of Paraguayan families to emerge from extreme poverty. However, our challenge is not only to continue making progress in that direction but to avoid having those who emerge from poverty fall back into it. Our most iconic initiatives and social protection schemes involve conditional monetary transfers, school lunches and pensions for the elderly. We also have specific programmes to put an end to the intergenerational transmission of poverty, such as the Sowing Opportunities Programme, which improves families\u2019 access to health and education and prioritizes women who are the heads of their households. In Paraguay, we strongly promote infrastructure, and we are taking measures to improve transparency and accountability in public institutions. \u201cThe public domain open to the public.\u201d That is our Government\u2019s motto.\nAdditionally, we encourage productive development by promoting investments, with the understanding that the private sector plays an important role in creating opportunities that help provide jobs for all and decent work. Countries like ours, which greatly depend on natural resources, are more vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, for Paraguay, the Paris Agreement is a priority. I would like to announce that the National Congress has approved the Agreement, and in a few days we will put the relevant ratification into effect.\nInternational trade is a pillar of sustainable development. However, landlocked developing countries face special needs and challenges in their efforts to be full and effective members of the global economy and benefit from it. The Republic of Paraguay urges developed countries to allow increased access to their markets for products from landlocked developing countries through their inclusion in systems of generalized preferences, trade financing programmes and programmes of aid for trade, and by promoting the integration of landlocked countries into global and regional production chains. The Republic of Paraguay is fighting for the prompt implementation of the Bali Agreement on Trade Facilitation, which will undoubtedly result in increased competitiveness in global markets.\nYoung people are the most important human capital of a country, and Paraguay has one of the largest youth populations among Latin American countries. Convinced that we must prepare them for the challenges of contributing to a better and more just society, our Government has started the Don Antonio Carlos L\u00f3pez Scholarship Programme for studies abroad, which has benefitted hundreds of youth. This year, we also launched the first call announcing specialized study scholarships for teachers in all parts of the country.\nSince the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the international community has seen great progress in the international promotion and protection of human rights. One of the most significant steps was the establishment of the Human Rights Council, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year. For Paraguay, a current member, it is essential to strengthen the Council, give it the necessary tools to persevere in its mandate, and eliminate any obstacles that may weaken it. We proudly emphasize that our country has developed the Recommendations Monitoring System, which makes it possible to transparently and openly verify compliance with international recommendations on human rights at the national level. We have made that mechanism available to all States interested in replicating it in the context of their national realities.\nParaguay welcomes the historic bilateral agreement and definitive ceasefire between the Republic of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and congratulates all those who made it possible. The Paraguayan people extend their best wishes to Colombia, with whom we are joined in bonds of historical and unbreakable friendship. We genuinely hope that this new stage will be one of national reconciliation and unification, so that together the country may face the challenges ahead in order to build a country in peace and social justice where no one is excluded.\nWe support the use of dialogue, good-faith political solutions and peaceful means as the only tools suitable for resolving conflicts, so that agreements that promote lasting and sustainable peace in the framework of international law can be achieved.\n"

I wish him sustained success in the discharge of the noble tasks with which he has been entrusted. I also wish to express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his outstanding contribution and his efficient and highly professional management of the work of the General Assembly at the seventieth session.\nWe commend the extraordinary efforts exerted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during his two terms with a view to achieving the goals of the international Organization in establishing the foundations of peace and security in the world. We share the hope he expressed in his statement at the beginning of the general debate (see A/71/PV.8) that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change will enter into force by the end of this year. We also endorse his proposal for the establishment of a high-level panel to find practical solutions that will improve decision-making mechanisms at the United Nations. We support the continued pursuit of the great achievements that took place in all domains, notably in the fields of education and health, during the past decade. I seize this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General our thanks and appreciation for all that he has accomplished at the helm of the Organization and to wish him every success in his future endeavours in the service of his own country and the world at large.\nThe theme of this general debate, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, testifies to our collective will and earnest desire to achieve those Goals. Under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, my country attaches great importance to the Goals and has already started to implement them, as is documented in international reports. My country will persevere in its commitment, consistent with its ambitious national plans and programmes, fully convinced that the achievement of the Goals promises a bright future for its citizens.\nA few days ago, the United Nations held an important demonstration of its relationship with the Kingdom of Bahrain, namely, the Sustainable Development Award ceremony hosted by Bahrain on 23 September on the margins of the General Assembly. There, His Royal Highness Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa\u2019s Sustainable Development Award was presented to Professor Anna Tibaijuka, former Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), a deserving laureate. The presentation underlines the Kingdom\u2019s vision of sustainable development as a value that it not only seeks to achieve but also one that it seeks to promote by supporting all endeavours aimed at realizing it throughout the world.\nThe achievements of Bahraini women at the international level \u2014 notably by being elected to membership of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Executive Board of UN-Women and the fact that Bahrain received first place internationally for the highest growth rate of women\u2019s participation in economic activities, as documented in a report of the International Labour Organization this year \u2014 testify to the close cooperation between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United Nations and the keen interest of my country, represented by the Supreme Council for Women under the leadership of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabika Bint Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, in enhancing the empowerment of Bahraini women nationally and internationally and accelerating their participation in all Government and community sectors as a principal component that has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the process of community development and progress.\n\u201cDevelopment that does not have the citizen as its target is futile and undesirable\u201d. Those were the words of His Majesty the King at the launch of the Bahrain Economic Vision 2030, clearly affirming that the well-being, happiness and stability of our citizens are the main pillars of development in all fields and that the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the global development goals are in parallel with its national economic vision. The Government\u2019s action plan and its United Nations Development Programme country programme document both stress that Bahrain will continue to guarantee to all citizens, men and women alike, the enjoyment of all their constitutional rights. We shall steadfastly pursue our approach to progress, prosperity and advancement, despite all political and economic challenges and any attempt to divert us from our national task.\nDevelopment goes hand in hand with the security and stability of the individual citizen and of society at large. Neither can be achieved in isolation from the other, without a stable and secure State, with good governance and solid and effective institutions. Such is the road map that should be followed in all States generally and in the Middle East in particular, where the enormous challenges have been considered grave threats to international peace and security. It is for that reason that protection of the foundations of the nation State in our own countries and preventing their collapse in other countries is the basis for sustaining security, development and prosperity. It deserves to become the major objective of all actors and groupings of the international community, without double standards or hidden agendas. When united regionally and internationally, we are capable of addressing all those challenges, particularly terrorism.\nWe should jointly commit ourselves, without hesitation and in full determination, to eradicating all the underlying causes of terrorism, cutting off the sources of financing to terrorists and resolutely and vigorously protecting our societies from the discourse of hate and extremism. In that regard, we assert that anti-terrorism measures will not be effective through legislation and laws that contravene the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law. The approach taken by the United States Congress in passing the Justice against the Sponsors of Terrorism Act jeopardizes international relations based on the principle of the equal sovereignty of States and their sovereign immunity. It constitutes a dangerous precedent in relations between nations and threatens the stability of the international system, which in turn adversely affects international efforts to combat terrorism.\nThe question of displaced persons and refugees is among the serious issues generated by the situation prevailing in some countries in our region. It is negatively impacting development efforts and, if not resolved, will lead to more instability not just in the region, but throughout the world. The Syrian crisis, in all its phases and developments, constitutes the greatest human tragedy of our contemporary world. In a country that just a few years ago welcomed thousands of refugees, the Syrian population today is unable to live in peace and security on its own land. More than half of the Syrian people live as refugees or internally displaced persons, while the situation deteriorates day after day, creating a vacuum exploited by terrorist organizations to consolidate their position and threaten the entire region. We must, as an ethical and human imperative, address those threats, and the international community must act in unison to confront the problem from all angles.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Kuwait, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Lebanese Republic and the Republic of Turkey to mitigate the humanitarian predicament of Syrians. We invite the international community to aid the efforts of our countries. We commend the United Nations for its efforts in that respect, which recently culminated in the high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants and the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex). Follow-up actions to implement the provisions of the Declaration will undoubtedly have a positive impact.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has consistently supported the aspirations of the Syrian people to build, in accord with their own will, a civil State with a national fabric rich in cultural and human heritage and diverse in its various components, with a view to restoring the spirit of love and tolerance. We call on all States with leverage in the Syrian crisis, notably the United States and the Russian Federation, to join efforts to achieve a political solution to the crisis along the lines of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). Furthermore, it is imperative to implement Security Council resolution 2165 (2014), which stipulates the direct, unfettered and immediate delivery of humanitarian assistance to the entire Syrian territory, thereby saving that beloved country and its people from a tragedy we all want to see ended, avoiding the collapse of the remaining State institutions, preserving\nSyria\u2019s territorial integrity, eradicating all terrorist organizations at large in the country and putting an end to the regional meddling, whether direct or by proxy, that hinders the peaceful settlement of the crisis.\nIn the same vein, we encourage all efforts in Iraq to overcome the problems facing the reconstruction of the State and its institutions and the fulfilment of the will of the Iraqi people through the participation of all political factions, without external pressure. We stress the need for perseverance in the efforts to re-establish State authority over the entire national territory by ousting the terrorist organizations and to combat the criminal and inhumane practices of extremist militias against Iraqis and their neighbours under the pretext of fighting terrorism.\nWe look forward to the day when we shall see an independent Palestinian State, living in peace and security, side by side with the State of Israel. I have no doubt whatsoever that the people of the region, both Arabs and Israelis, are eager to see this day and look forward to a just and comprehensive peace. That hope remains contingent on Israel\u2019s admission that its security and stability cannot be ensured unless the same holds true for the Palestinian people. Israel needs to be serious about achieving a just and durable peace in the region, with Palestinians and Israelis alike feeling that they are safe and that their future and the future of their children are also safe. An end must be put to the practices that hinder the long-awaited peace, notably the violations against the sanctity of Al-Aqsa mosque that offend the feelings of Muslims all over the world. All illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory should be dismantled. Recognition must be given to the right of the Palestinian people to an independent State, within the 4 June 1967 boundaries, with East Jerusalem as its capital, consistent with international law and instruments and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Israel should respond positively and in an open spirit to the Arab Peace Initiative, which is still valid and on the table. We continue to embrace the Initiative and shall not back down, as it offers the correct and appropriate approach to laying down the foundation of peace in the region and to promoting cooperation among its nations and States.\nWith respect to the situation in the Republic of Yemen, the commitment of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a member of the Arab coalition to restore legitimacy in Yemen, will remain steadfast. Bahrain has spared no resources or blood to achieve this noble goal, and we shall continue on that path, no matter how great the sacrifices, until the time when the legitimate Government under the leadership of His Excellency President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour is in a position to take control of the entire territory of Yemen.\nWe underline the humanitarian role played by the coalition forces and their determination not to target civilians. We demand that the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat forces and their supporters, whose ambition is to take control of the institutions of the State, immediately cease committing any negative actions that hinder stability. We do not stand against any Yemeni party, but we do stand by Yemen and the Yemeni people in their fight against all who try to harm Yemen or control it from outside. We will continue this support until a political settlement is reached and a peaceful solution that puts an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people is implemented.\nSuch a solution must safeguard the security, stability and unity of the Yemeni people in accordance with international terms of reference, notably the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative and its implementation mechanism, the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference and resolution 2216 (2015). We commend the efforts exerted by Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy for Yemen, and by the State of Kuwait to help find a settlement to the crisis.\nWith respect to Libya, that brotherly Arab country badly needs all parties to show solidarity, work together to get through the present difficult stage and overcome the challenges that the country faces. Those challenges are obstructing the people\u2019s aspirations to live in peace and enjoy the stability of a unified State with robust modern institutions. We welcome the formation of the Government of National Accord and stress the need to provide it with the necessary support in order for the Libyan House of Representatives to build the necessary confidence that will enable it to lead the country, discharge its duties and responsibilities and rid the country of terrorist organizations by eradicating them.\nWith respect to the issue of the Western Sahara, the Kingdom of Bahrain underlines the need to find a political settlement on the basis of the Moroccan initiative for self-government and the relevant Security Council resolutions, so that the territorial integrity of Morocco may be guaranteed and that the security and stability in the region may be enhanced. We welcome\nthe return of Morocco to the African Union and the resumption of its vital role on the continent.\nWith regard to the Islamic Republic of Iran, we in the GCC and all Arab countries have spared no effort to build the best relations possible with that neighbouring country on the basis of good-neighbourliness and respect for the sovereignty of States, consistent with the practices and principles of international relations between States. We have not hesitated for an instant to build bridges and seek to improve relations with it. However, despite all these efforts and sincere wishes, there has never been a serious response from Iran. The efforts we undertook ended either in an impasse or with a creation of new problems and crises that obligated us to return to square one.\nWe still hear the same irresponsible sectarian discourse from Iran and have witnessed the damage done to our bilateral and multilateral relations. In the most recent incident, Iranian officials made false allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is a country that plays a laudable role in efficiently providing hospitality, safety, protection and care for large numbers of pilgrims during the seasons of Hajj and Umrah. No one can deny or minimize the importance of those efforts.\nWe continue to face Iran\u2019s attempts to jeopardize our security and social peace through the support it provides to groups and militias under its authority, such as the terrorists of Hizbullah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran also continues to occupy three Emirati islands in the Arabian Gulf and refuses mediation for a peaceful settlement.\nThe situation is clear, and there is no way that it will change if Iran does not undertake a comprehensive change in its foreign policies, put an end to its hostile policies and show an open attitude towards our countries. Doing those things would undoubtedly pave the way for the region to enter a new era of stability and development.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the need to join efforts aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, notably nuclear weapons, in the Middle East, including the Arabian Gulf region, while stressing the right of countries to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Nuclear power was created only to serve human beings and to improve their lives, not to harm them or be used as lethal weapons that might obliterate entire cities and kill millions of innocent people.\nWe have before us an opportunity to overcome the challenges facing us and maintain the strength and cohesion of our nations and peoples. We belong to a region that has made tremendous human contributions and great civilizational achievements. Our region has contributed effectively to all that we witness and live out today by way of the human progress we have contributed to in various fields of endeavour, including the sciences. All of that was possible only because those who lived in the region did so in an atmosphere of full security and harmony, without divisions based on ethnic, ideological or religious differences. We should remember that fact as we work to build the future we seek for our countries and future generations with a view to making important contributions to human civilization that we can be proud of.\nI would repeat here a few words by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa:\n\u201cThe Kingdom of Bahrain and its people epitomize the principles of friendship, tolerance, mutual respect and openness to the world. We are proud of our diversity and our solid belief that every individual has the right to enjoy a safe and decent life.\u201d\nThose words, characteristic of the Kingdom of Bahrain and its citizens, clearly reflect the spirit of the region and the aspirations of its people.\nI would like to conclude by saying that the Kingdom of Bahrain, with its leadership and enlightened people eager to embrace the love and peace of the world and all its peoples, will remain faithful to the lofty human values and principles on which we have prided ourselves since time immemorial. As we confront the challenges to the Kingdom\u2019s safety and achievements, we shall hold fast to these values, while remembering that they illuminate our path towards a safe and stable society in which everyone enjoys security, prosperity and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "This year, once again, the United Nations calls upon all the countries on planet Earth to participate in the General Assembly, which is \u2014 one could say \u2014 a kind of global Parliament. Once again this year, we have the chance to take stock of the advances and setbacks that we have experienced in this large joint enterprise aimed at promoting peace, security and the respect of human rights. Once again this year, we are here to be critical, demanding and\nself-demanding, and to reflect on the need to renew and improve the system of the United Nations.\nHowever, the fact that I can say \u201conce again this year\u201d represents, in itself, a success. Beyond the good decisions and the not-so-good ones made over the years, the mere fact that almost 200 sovereign States symbolically renew their commitment to the United Nations each year is a reason for hope for those of us who, like the people of Andorra, firmly believe in multilateralism and the need to promote peace, security and justice.\nThroughout its more than seven decades of existence, the United Nations has not been a passive stakeholder or a static feature. Quite the contrary, it has managed to extend its mission, make its objectives more ambitious and give them content with tangible results. The United Nations was created to promote peace, security and human rights. However, year after year, it has spread its area of action to become what we see today, that is, a large Assembly of all the countries on planet Earth, which seek to resolve what affects all of us domestically and among all of us.\nThe past 12 months have been highly constructive with regard to advances in the multilateral area. Just one year ago, in September 2015, we unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals listed in what is known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A few months later, the international community \u2014 thanks to the driving force and leadership of the French Republic and our colleague Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 demonstrated its ability to give shape and content to the Goals with the drafting and signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nFollowing in the wake of the United Nations, Andorra dedicated this year\u2019s programme at its Summer University to the Sustainable Development Goals as specified in the 2030 Agenda. For one week, Andorra la Vella, our capital, was home to the reflections and debates of experts, as well as institutional representatives, such as the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and two Under-Secretaries-General of the United Nations.\nThe Andorra Summer University marks the beginning of the academic year in our country, following the summer break. This year, the people of Andorra started the academic year by confirming and demonstrating our commitment to the values of multilateralism and international cooperation. We have done so by adding our own particular accent, placing emphasis on education. We therefore chose the Summer University as the setting for Andorra to show its commitment to the 2030 Agenda.\nAll the Sustainable Development Goals share the same priority. However, Goal 4, on quality education is doubly important. On the one hand, it is an objective in and of itself that has a direct link to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. But it is also a means to achieve the rest of the Goals. At the time of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the General Assembly warned about the need to detail the Goals in their specific implementation and seek the involvement of all stakeholders \u2014 not just public institutions \u2014 in that ambitious enterprise. Therefore, global involvement, including on the part of individuals, local institutions and large supranational organizations, requires a key tool, namely, education.\nThe great edifice of the United Nations principles and values is built upon the idea that what affects all of us needs to be solved by all of us and that global matters require coordinated global actions. It is true that a global world needs global institutions, as well as global regulations and global solutions. But the entire architecture will be as fragile as a house of cards if we do not educate new generations to be global citizens. A global world needs global citizens.\nIn striving to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, Andorra is placing its emphasis on education and extending quality education to everyone, not only as a goal in and of itself but also to promote education towards global citizenship. Such citizenship is aware of the challenges and the opportunities in our world, sensitive to the protection of human rights, and open and prepared for the dynamics of our times.\nDuring the past several years, the Government that I head has made education the centre of Andorra\u2019s foreign policy in the multilateral arena. We did so during the Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe for 2012-2013. We did so by joining the Global Education First Initiative, promoted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We have done so in the contexts of the Ibero-American Community and the International Organization of la Francophonie. We will also do so by making education one of our priorities as members of the Economic and Social Council. We will continue to do so in all multilateral forums dealing with education. However, in keeping with Goal 17 of the 2030 Agenda, we are aware that we need to seek alliances with other countries, joint actions and partnerships between the public and the private sectors.\nAllow me to offer a recent example of Andorran action in the multilateral arena. Two weeks ago, the twenty-fifth Conference of Ministers of Education of Ibero-American countries was held in Andorra. The meeting gave rise to a commitment by the Ibero- American Governments to promote the mobility of all our students. An agreement among the Governments, the Ibero-American Secretary-General, the Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture and the Ibero-American University Board will promote the mobility of university students within the Ibero-American area, which currently has 22 full member States. The aim of the signatories is to offer mobility to 200,000 university students between now and 2020.\nAs always when talking about education, the goal is twofold. On the one hand, the goal is to promote an exchange of experiences, which contributes to improving the quality of our education systems. On the other hand \u2014 and this is probably the most important part \u2014 the goal is to make our young people aware of the fact that their reality and their future do not end at the borders of the country in which they were born, but rather that they are citizens of a global society. To some degree, we are following in the wake of the Erasmus programme for the mobility of university students in Europe. What has done more to promote European construction \u2014 all the regulations and directives that make up the European Union acquis, or all the young people who, for decades, have been completing part of their university courses in other European countries and who feel European?\nIt is not the young people who wish to isolate themselves. And those of us who are here today \u2014 most of whom are from a generation that has left its youth behind \u2014 must be increasingly more generous and more open-minded, because the future of our young people, the future of our countries and the future of our world depends on it. If we educate our young people as citizens of a global world, we will be laying the foundation for a much more open, cooperative and fair world.\nIn line with the theme of this session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, Andorra\u2019s commitment to quality education is not limited to diverse actions in multilateral forums, but also has a local dimension. The local dimension begins as a result of the good fortune \u2014 and it is necessary to say that because it is good fortune \u2014 that we enjoy in having three public systems that are free and available: the Spanish, the French and the Andorran systems. That in itself makes up a pluralist educational community with a marked international component.\nIn that sense, the people of Andorra have been pioneers in our education system in introducing \u201ceducation by skills\u201d, which is a model that seeks to overcome the old concept of education as a simple accumulation of knowledge to focus on education understood as a set of abilities and skills to apply that knowledge. The reason for that model is that what is important is not so much knowing, but thinking; we do not wish to create encyclopaedias, but rather citizens. Citizens who can develop themselves and grow in a world that is changing at great speed and who, when faced with the expected and the unexpected, are able to react appropriately and who are not afraid of changes, dynamism and opening up.\nWe in Andorra have been working on education centred on transversal skills for some years now. And now \u2014 precisely because of the need to educate global citizens \u2014 we wish to go one step further. Andorra, in coordination with the Council of Europe, will introduce training programmes on democratic values and systems, so as to measure the abilities and skills of our young people with regard to such democratic values. Why not think about a global commitment to educating our young children on the principles and values of the United Nations, and more specifically, on the Sustainable Development Goals embodied in the 2030 Agenda? Because in 2030, it will be them, and not us, who will be sitting here in the General Assembly.\nThe great dialectic of our times is not \u2014 as it used to be in the past \u2014 between the right and the left, or the policy of blocs, typical of the Cold War, which we have thankfully left behind. The great dialectic of our time is between being open and being closed, between those who wish for an open, transparent, cooperative and dynamic world with strong multilateral institutions and those who wish for a closed, opaque and static world in which each country looks, only and exclusively, after its own interests.\nThe road to opening up to commitment, negotiation and multilateralism is the path that we have been tracing for decades under the auspices of the United Nations. The path to closing down is a reflection of fear and a recipe for populists and opportunists, who, when faced with an economic crisis of global scope, withdraw into protectionism; when faced with a threat to security of global scope, close their borders; when faced with a challenge such as climate change, adopt the selfish attitude of free riding, or expecting others to make the efforts. The answers of populism are that it is other people\u2019s fault and that we should isolate ourselves from the others. However, in a global society, we are the others.\nI believe that we are all here at the Assembly to renew our confidence in a multilateral way and to continue practicing the maxim that says that global matters require global answers. The Principality of Andorra today reiterates its belief in the multilateral path. Because it is in forums such as the General Assembly that a country like ours, with a surface area of 468 square kilometres and just over 70,000 inhabitants, can be on an equal footing with the rest of the nations on the planet. And I do not mean just rhetorical equality \u2014 we have been participating and getting involved in coordinated, balanced actions that involve the entire international community, and we have been doing so for years.\nWe have demonstrated that, quite adequately in my opinion, by participating with all our efforts to build a more cooperative, transparent and fair global economy. Over the past five years, Andorra has opened its economy to foreign investment, given economic rights to all international residents, set up a comparable tax system following international standards, made progressive advances in matters of exchanging fiscal information, which will culminate next year with the automatic exchange of information within the area of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union, and we have also set up a network of double taxation treaties to internationalize the economic model.\nIn parallel, along with Monaco and San Marino, we are negotiating an association agreement with the European Union that will enable the full participation of Andorra in the European internal market. We have done so not only because we need to modernize and diversify our economy, but also because we are of the firm conviction that a world with more intense economic and commercial relations is by nature a world that cooperates more and is less selfish. It is also a world that is more inclined towards peace, harmony, negotiated solutions to conflicts and respect for human rights and liberties.\nIt was in that same spirit of firm confidence in global action that we participated last year in the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which led to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In the coming weeks, our Parliament will be asked to ratify the Paris Agreement. It is with that same mindset, in our view, that we need to deal with the matter of the huge displacements of refugees and migrants, which have become one of the great challenges of our times. It is a challenge that needs to be dealt with through the regulation, both internationally as well as locally, of migratory flows and the right to asylum, through the fair distribution of the impact that taking in a huge contingent of displaced people may represent, and through care and vigilance to ensure the respect of rights and the dignity of displaced people.\nIn that connection, I am delighted, taking up what I said before regarding the fundamental role of education, that the high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, which took place here on 19 September, also emphasized the need to construct a positive narrative on immigration. Andorra, which has for decades been a land that has welcomed many families from all over, is a good example of that positive narrative, as is the case, I am sure, for many of the countries represented here. However, in order for that narrative to continue to be valid, we also need to teach the value of respect for diversity. We must raise world citizens who do not fear difference or change.\nWhile populism would prefer protectionism and economic isolation, we opt for liberalization and greater integration of our national economies. While populism would prefer to deny the scientific evidence of climate change and turn its back on the problem, we opt instead for commitments and specific measurable actions. While populism would prefer to close borders, build walls and stoke the fear of difference, we opt instead for the dignity of persons, for regulation and for education about diversity.\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly with Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General. Many speakers have highlighted his career and his wise decisions over the last decade. Mr. Ban Ki-moon is the Secretary-General who brought about the effective implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and was the driving force behind the post-2015 development agenda. He has been a key player in the relaunching of the multilateral strategy in the fight against climate change, which culminated in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As a legacy of his 10- year mandate, he leaves us with a clearly marked path in the form of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Mr. Ban Ki-moon is therefore a fundamental player in any understanding or explanation of the United Nations, and by extension, of the entire international community during the first third of the twenty-first century.\nFor the people of Andorra, Mr. Ban Ki-moon is also the first Secretary-General to make an official visit to our country, as he did in April 2013. The Andorran people have heeded his teachings well. If education is the guiding thread to a good part of Andorra\u2019s multilateral action, that is also thanks to the insistence of the Secretary-General on making quality universal education one of the main pillars of his action during his 10 years at the helm of the United Nations. As Mr. Ban Ki-moon said during his visit to Andorra three and a half years ago, the United Nations will always be able to count on our country in the collective endeavour to build a more peaceful, secure and, above all, more equitable world.\n"

        "file_text": "As we have been hearing since the beginning of the week, we are here as representatives of a world in crisis, a war-torn world, divided by inequality, shocked by ever- increasing massive population displacements, afflicted by hunger and disease, and torn apart and grief-stricken by violence. We are also the representatives of a world threatened by global warming, made vulnerable by attacks on biodiversity, and concerned at new dangers such as ocean acidification and the melting of the permafrost.\nWe are doubly responsible for the situation of the world. We are responsible as human beings, because the tragedy has but one perpetrator \u2014 humans and their insatiable hunger for power. From the depletion of farmland to the flooding of land swallowed up by rising water levels and cities flattened by bombs, it is always the same quest for power that is the cause of global violence, which is why we are all responsible.\nBut we are also here as leaders of nations who are responsible for the world\u2019s future. It is up to us and the General Assembly to find responses to the suffering, injustice and other concerns. For 71 years, the United Nations has shown that it is capable of taking up those problems and offering the world sustainable solutions based on peace and cooperation. Over the past 10 years, under the stewardship of the Secretary-General, to whom I pay tribute, the United Nations has been at the forefront of all of the fights. Thanks to the Secretary- General, significant progress has been made on sustainable development with the adoption one year ago of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the adoption in December last year of a major agreement on climate change, the Paris Agreement.\nThose accomplishments should inspire us today and strengthen our determination. In the face of the contradictions that we face in the world, the United Nations, I would note, is the only forum where coherent global action is possible. It is the only place where conflicting interests can have a peaceful encounter in a spirit of progress. It is the only place where responsibility for humankind can be upheld over the ambition of individuals. Here, and nowhere else, humankind has a meeting with history, with destiny and with the judgment that our children will pronounce on its actions.\nThe Principality of Monaco, under the impetus of its sovereign Prince, Prince Albert II, is fully committed to multilateralism as the only way of tackling the topics on our agenda. I would like to mention three such issues that encompass most of the world\u2019s challenges.\nThe first is of course the issue of refugees and migrants, a topic that took up a large part of the beginning of the work of the current session of the General Assembly. All of us here are familiar with the tragedy that has afflicted so many civilian populations, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, and we know all too well the situation of the Syrian population, the 300,000 victims of the conflict and the tragedy of the survivors, caught in the middle of the violence committed by the State and the atrocities of the terrorists. Every month, every week, every day, the Mediterranean becomes the funeral shroud of dozens of women, children and men ready to risk everything to escape their fate, but for whom we can barely provide the little that they ask for \u2014 safety, subsistence and the hope of a better future.\nThat Mediterranean Sea, to which Monaco attaches great importance, the Sea that is both a link and a border to so many worlds, is once again at the heart of one of the main challenges of this new century. The Mediterranean today should help us understand that the tragedies on its shores are not those of different clashing worlds but rather the shores of the same world, ours. Regardless of our material situation or where we live, we cannot escape Earth\u2019s and humankind\u2019s woes. Whether we are dealing with wars or rising water levels, famines, storms or fanaticism, our interdependence is, from here on out, total. To quote John Donne, \u201cSend not to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\u201d\nThat is the purpose of the United Nations and its Charter \u2014 to proclaim our common humanity, whatever difficulties may arise. In that regard, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), which has just been adopted, fortunately recalls the principles according to which we must act, as well as the moral and legal obligations that we must all comply with. In that connection, we must give special consideration to unaccompanied minors and children separated from their families. Furthermore, many people live in damaged ecosystems that threaten their very existence. According to the most recent projections of the United Nations, there may be as many as 250 million climate refugees by 2050. Therefore, environmental degradation could tomorrow become the primary cause of migration. Hence, the importance of protecting our environment and implementing sustainable development for all. That represents a major commitment for Monaco and our Sovereign Prince Albert II, who for more than 20 years has been personally committed to that issue, both in all international forums where those subjects were addressed and in the field, working closely with affected populations.\nReconciling the imperatives of human development and those of the conservation of the Earth so as to make it possible for a population of 8 or 9 billion people in a few years to live together will be the major challenge of our century. In order to achieve that, we must first protect the climate.\nThe Paris Agreement, for which the Principality campaigned, represents a milestone. Monaco will become party to that Agreement by the end of 2016, once its National Council has adopted the law for its ratification. I also recall that Monaco is committed to reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 as compared with emission levels in 1990.\nDespite its small responsibility for global emissions, our country has the ambition to be a leader in using innovative means of transport and energy consumption.\nIn addition to preserving our common heritage and to limiting pollution, the use of inexhaustible renewable energy will also allow us to break with certain monopolies that generate inequalities today and destabilize our world. Such a programme of energy transfer has a cost, but we are convinced that that cost is small compared to the consequences of inaction. That is why Monaco is committed to maintaining its support for the Green Climate Fund.\nGlobal warming has several tragic consequences. One of them is related to the situation of the oceans. As we know, the sea surfaces have been severely neglected, even though they are critical for our common future. Monaco has a long-standing commitment to that issue, dating back to Prince Albert I, who was one of the founders of modern oceanography over 100 years ago. Since then, the Principality has taken action whenever the future of our seas was at stake. It did so in 2009, when it hosted 150 international scientists, who signed the Monaco Declaration, the first global warning about the acidification of the oceans. It also acted by taking on various targeted initiatives within the competent bodies, such as the one that made it possible for us to save bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. It also acted through the appeal, launched by Prince Albert II at the General Assembly in 2013, aimed at including what became Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the oceans in the 2030 Agenda. It continues to take action, month after month, by contributing to the development of protected coastal marine areas and to the future establishment of a network of protected areas on the high seas.\nWe are convinced that such conservation solutions will bring about extremely positive effects for the ecosystems and the populations that are directly or potentially affected. Similarly, the Principality of Monaco has taken action in the very important negotiations that are taking place today at the United Nations on issues of biodiversity and national jurisdiction.\nAll of those issues are essential for the Principality of Monaco. All of those issues take into account a primordial concern, which is the creation of our common future. It was through their ability to dominate and transform nature that our ancestors were able to develop and secure the future of their children. However, we must now also admit that it is through our capacity to protect nature and accept its rules that we can realize our potential and build a future for humankind. That change in the model disrupts our ways of thinking. It will take time for it to take hold and to replace the traditional ways of thinking that have shaped our world and its inhabitants for millenniums.\nWhat we need to do today is to bring about a change of civilization. However, we can make progress in that direction only if all of humankind comes along with us with its dreams and desires. The 2016 UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report also highlights a priority \u2014 that of education. Forty per cent of 15-year- old children have basic knowledge of environmental issues. That brings me to the third issue for our Organization that I would like to underscore today before the Assembly.\nMore than ever, UNICEF, which is celebrating its seventieth anniversary this year, should play a central role in solving the world\u2019s problems, many of which relate to women and children. At a time when women are still subjected to so much violence and discrimination and when sexual violence is increasing in such an unacceptable way, we should also support the crucial work of UNICEF. In that respect, I would also like to reiterate the full support of the Principality of Monaco for the Security Council resolutions on women and peace and security, on the protection of women in times of conflict and the strengthening of their role in peacekeeping, restoring peace and building of peace. In our unstable and unjust world, we know that education, especially that of girls, is the solution to many of the problems we face. It is through women that the values of tolerance and respect can be upheld. That is why the education of girls and, more broadly, the equal education of all children should be a priority for all.\nThe power of the United Nations lies in bringing States together to work in the service of the common good. That common good is today still high on the agenda of the Assembly. We must better manage refugees and migrants by protecting the planet and through education for children and the establishment of a genuine equality between men and women. That is the path that Monaco will follow. Loyal to its values, its history and its commitments, the Principality of Monaco will continue, with determination, to move forward along that path, together with the entire international community, for a better future.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by conveying my warm congratulations to the President on his brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. He can be assured of the Gabonese delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation throughout his tenure. Allow me to also commend the remarkable work of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose efforts enabled us to bring new momentum to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted a year ago.\nSince then, major events have taken place throughout the world in the areas of politics, the environment, economics and security. As regards politics, this meeting comes in the wake of a disputed presidential election in my country. The final results, which were announced last night, confirmed the re-election of His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba as President of the Republic and Head of State. I would like to take the opportunity to express the gratitude of the Government and people of Gabon to the friendly countries who stood with us. I thank the entire international community for its support during this very sensitive time in the history of Gabon. In order to ensure credible elections that could deliver results acceptable to all political actors, the Government sought to implement specific confidence-building and transparency measures. On its initiative, the Parliament passed the law establishing the use of biometrics in the procedures used in preparing the electoral roll.\nThe President of the Republic wanted the election to be free, transparent and open. To that end, the Government invited over 1,200 observers and accredited over 200 foreign journalists. Thus, many electoral observer missions, both international and subregional, were deployed throughout the country.\nNotwithstanding all these guarantees, the provisional results of the vote made public by the Ministry of the Interior were challenged, sometimes with unprecedented violence, which unfortunately resulted in serious incidents, including the deplorable loss of human lives. The turmoil that this caused at the national and international levels reflected the gravity of the situation. In accordance with legal procedures, appeals were submitted to the competent judicial body, the Constitutional Court. It was the job of the Court, whose decisions cannot be appealed, to confirm or overturn the provisional results. The Court issued its verdict last night, in which it confirmed the re-election of President Ali Bongo Ondimba.\nTaking stock of the situation, President Ali Bongo Ondimba has called for an inclusive dialogue, reconciliation and unity. Restoring social cohesion and national unity is the current priority. Maintaining the country\u2019s peace and stability is the other challenge we face. My delegation therefore calls on the international community to support it in this effort, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the rule of law, democracy and good governance. In this respect, we will strengthen political and economic governance. The bodies responsible for preventing and settling conflicts nationally \u2014 the National Council for Democracy and the Mediator of the Republic \u2014 will be provided with substantial resources that will enable them to fulfil their mandates.\nI would like to pay a strong and well-deserved tribute to those partners of Gabon, both bilateral and multilateral, who stood beside us before, during and after the election. I am thinking of France, the United States, Morocco and many other friendly countries in Africa and throughout world that spared no efforts in that regard. I am thinking, of course, of the United Nations, the African Union, the International Organization of la Francophonie, the European Union and many other partners, to which I would like to convey our unending gratitude.\nOther major events deserve our attention. They include the widely praised diplomatic rapprochement between the United States and Cuba. It is my hope that the thawing of relations between these two countries will lead to the lifting of the economic embargo. I would also mention the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Paris. The entire world was pleased to see the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on 12 December 2015. Thanks to the clear determination of all the countries that took part in this important meeting, the success was commensurate with our expectations. Gabon, strongly committed to countering global warming, made its contribution. The Paris Agreement is a historic turning point in our quest for a more sustainable and caring world. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a great step forward for humankind. We must now show the same determination in implementing it as we did in reaching it.\nI note with great satisfaction that the number of countries that have ratified the Agreement is growing. I welcome the remarkable momentum building in the international community, and I would like to believe that the Agreement will enter into force between now and the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. As far as Gabon is concerned, we have already begun the process of ratification. We will do our utmost to deposit our instrument of ratification as soon as possible.\nIt is difficult today to speak of the results of COP 21 without mentioning the challenges facing the twenty-second session. COP 22 is seen as an extension of COP 21. It will be held in Morocco, with a central focus on the issue of energy development in Africa. Two thirds of Africans are without electricity \u2014 an injustice that we must mobilize to remedy. It is time to apply ourselves jointly to the realization of all of our intitiatives and all our announced agendas. Gabon welcomes the mobilization of Morocco and its commitment to the success of COP 22, especially in view of the parties\u2019 envisaged adoption of urgent measures within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That goes to show the value that Gabon attaches to environmental issues, which are at the heart of the Agenda and which we adopted at the seventieth session of the General Assembly in this very Hall.\nAt a time when we are rocked by economic, social and political crises, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represents today a new push to transform our world. It is therefore important that the enthusiasm surrounding the adoption of the 2030 Agenda be reflected in action in order to accelerate its implementation. That is the major challenge the international community will face over the coming years.\nThe poverty eradication, conservation of the environment and sharing of prosperity to which we all aspire are requirements that call for a greater mobilization of human and financial resources, together with increased involvement on the part of the private sector. I mention the mobilization of human resources because people must remain at the centre of our policies and actions. For that reason, the involvement of all actors is more than critical. By \u201cactors\u201d, I mean young people, women, persons with disabilities, refugees, migrants, civil society and the private sector.\nThe mobilization of financial resources is needed because the implementation of the SDGs requires that we meet a whole set of needs. We must therefore redouble our creativity and find new sources of financing, so as not to repeat the errors associated with the implementation of Millennium Development Goals. The private sector needs to be mobilized and involved because it plays a key role with regard to productivity, economic growth, job creation and wealth creation. It is therefore time for the private sector to play a larger role in tackling the challenges linked to sustainable development.\nI wish to reassure everybody that Gabon will continue its unflagging efforts when it comes to tackling the problems posed by sustainable development and finding new ways of managing our economies. In that regard, our Government created the Investment and Export Promotion Agency, which is required to come up with harmonious strategies to improve our business climate and to implement strict and appropriate management methods with regard to our natural resources. The Agency is also responsible for designing and implementing a sectoral approach that focuses on initial processing at the local level and rational management of our environment. We felt it was necessary to modify our traditional economic approach by integrating into it a new, sustainable balance between our people and our environment and also a space-time dimension with respect to development. That approach is designed to address the growing gap between poor and rich and to anticipate and avert the consequences, for the environment and for future generations, of poorly controlled or uncontrolled growth.\nAs, I think, everyone will agree, if we are to fulfil our commitments in respect of sustainable development and tackling climate change, we need a peaceful society. For that reason my country approves any initiative that will ensure peace and security within our borders, in the subregion of Central Africa, and throughout the entire world. The concept of peace is a constant that has always characterized the experience of the people of Gabon. Hence, Gabon actively participates in the fight against terrorism, which operates in various parts of the world indiscriminately. The presence of Gabon at the Second Regional Security Summit for Africa, held in Abuja in May, is proof of our commitment to a world without terrorism. The decline in the activities of Boko Haram in the Chad Basin prove that the synergy of our efforts is paying off.\nThe fight against an enemy that is asymmetrical is far from having been won. Despite increased cooperation and significant resources deployed on the ground, and although we have raised our levels of alertness and added to the capabilities of our special forces, small terrorist groups are proving to be resilient and are displaying an unprecedented capacity for doing harm.\nIn both Syria and Iraq, the so-called Islamic State \u2014 in spite of being weakened \u2014 still has sufficient financial and technical means to challenge the international coalition. We must, therefore, do all we can to deplete its sources of supply.\nIf we are to overcome the terrorist threat, we must first resolve the conflicts in Libya and Syria. I need hardly remind those present that the current chaos has become fertile ground for the nebulous terrorists to operate and to expand their destabilizing activities. The migratory crisis, which is unprecedented, is also being stoked by the conflicts in Libya and Syria. As we have repeatedly said, the only alternative to these crises is a political solution arrived at through negotiation. Any military solution should be in keeping with that approach.\nPoaching and trafficking of all types also constitute threats to our collective peace and security. My country welcomes the second General Assembly resolution to tackle poaching (resolution 70/301), adopted on 9 September 2016. My country is particularly concerned about the lack of progress in the general and complete disarmament process, as it is about the paralysis of the multilateral disarmament mechanisms. The resumption of work requires that all Member States recommit their efforts. Maintaining the status quo is not a viable solution.\nThe prevailing and persistent impasse in the Israeli- Palestinian peace process is also not viable. The lack of constructive dialogue serves neither the cause of Israel\u2019s security nor that of bringing about a stable and prosperous Palestinian State. On the contrary, it serves only to heighten tensions, distrust and insecurity. We believe that any lasting solution that is acceptable to all has to emerge from direct negotiations between the concerned parties, not from unilateral approaches. We reaffirm Gabon\u2019s support for France\u2019s proposal regarding the convening of a conference, before the year\u2019s end, at which the Israelis and the Palestinians would be able to resume negotiations.\nAs for Moroccan Sahara, there is still the option of a negotiated political solution. In my view, it is the best way forward if we are to break the deadlock that has been in place for several years. My country reiterates its support for the Moroccan initiative, which we believe is realistic and capable of leading, under the aegis of the United Nations, to a lasting settlement of that issue.\nIn closing, allow me to pay a heartfelt tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate is coming to an end. I thank him for his tireless and constant efforts to uphold the noble aims of the Organization and for the many initiatives he has led with a view to realizing the projects and ambitions of the United Nations for the world. I thank him for everything he has done during the ten years he has spent at the helm of our Secretariat. On behalf of Gabon, my delegation welcomes the reforms he has brought about in our Organization, which will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the world. It thanks him for his leadership on issues as important as climate change, migration flows, humanitarian assistance, questions of peace and security, and the reform of the Security Council.\n"
