        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like first to congratulate the President, the representative of a country that is making a great contribution to the establishment of peace and expanding international cooperation, on his election to preside over the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly and to assure him of my delegation's willingness to give him every assistance in the performance of his important and responsible task.\nOur delegation is especially pleased at the admission to membership in our Organisation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, with which we have for centuries enjoyed a tradition of friendly relations. We hope that those will grow stronger and be further enriched. We also congratulate the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on their admission to membership in the United Nations. We express our willingness to expand cooperation with those countries on a multilateral and bilateral basis.\nWe welcome the admission to United Nations membership of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nIn 1914 Maxim Bogdanovich, the well-known Belarusian poet, whose centenary is this year being celebrated under the aegis of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), wrote the following lines:\n\\\"There is such wealth and beauty everywhere, \\\"Yet men still starve and toil \\\"In poverty, in ignorance, \\\"Because of boundaries and barriers.\\\" \nThe poet was expressing concern at man's deepening isolation, at his alienation from the world. He was inspired to seek the establishment of a sew and store just world order based oil the unshakeable principles of freedom and respect for the individual. Maksim Bahdanovich could not be criticized for believing in the idea of some kind of universal State without borders. He was one of the champions of the awakening of the national self-awareness of his people to whose selflessness we owe a great deal for the establishment of our modern State, the Republic of Belarus.\nIn order to understand the historical destiny of our people, we must of necessity take a look at the past that would shed light on the darkness of long-past centuries with their bloody past and on our movement towards freedom, the glorious and also tragic pages of our national history, which would help us better understand and try to envision our future. Today we note with pride that the traditions of Belarusian statehood have a history that goes back many centuries. It was embodied in various forms of a State system and reached its zenith in the Middle Ages. The Belarusians - whose language was used back in 1588 to draft the Statute, a code of legal norms which was advanced - even classic - for the Europe of that day, never showed any feelings of enmity or hostility towards their neighbours nor any desire to kindle the flames of disputes among nationalities.\nThe traditions of statehood were again made manifest in the first quarter of the twentieth century, when the Belarusian State was proclaimed. During the relatively short time of its independent existence it was recognized de jure and de facto by a number of European States, with which it began to develop bilateral relations.\nIt would, however, be wrong to portray the history of our ethnos as a serene sequence of achievements and successes. I think the contrary would be true. It is hard to find in Europe any people that has suffered so much and been so destitute, and which has so often been exposed to devastating raids, invasions and acts of aggression. Over the last 600 years, according to a very conservative estimate we have lost in the flames of war no fewer than 12 million people. Because of fate our geopolitical situation - at the crossroads between Central and Eastern Europe - was tragically reflected in the destinies of Belarusians, casting them implacably from the moloch of one war to another. Between the hammer and the anvil, between two strong neighbours - that, very generally speaking, is the way I would express the quintessential nature of our national history. Thus it was in the late eighteenth century, when under certain well-known historical conditions the Belarusian lands became part of Russia. Thus it was in 1918 in Brest, when the territory of Belarus was carved up at will, forgetting to ask the people what it wanted. Thus it was in 1921, when the tragic, for us, Riga Treaty was signed, cutting up into two parts for almost 20 years the war-ravaged, bleeding land of Belarus. Thus it was in January 1945 at Yalta, where the ruthless hand of Stalin laid hold of the map and manipulated the destinies of hundreds of thousands of Belarusians. We do not want to be a shadow of our neighbours; we do not want to be the small change in a big European game.\nI say this, not in order to reverse the course of history or rewrite it: the past remains the past. But today we are absolutely devoted to the spirit of the Helsinki and Paris agreements and we believe in the unconditional recognition of the primacy of international law.\nNow my motherland is experiencing another stage in its development of statehood. That is why I am deeply moved to inform this world parliament, the entire international community, that on 25 August of this year, a decision by the supreme legislative organ of our Republic gave constitutional status to the declaration of State sovereignty of the Republic. Our Supreme Soviet also proclaimed the political and economic independence of the Republic, and on 19 September of this year took a decision to rename the State - it is now called the Republic of Belarus - and also to establish new State symbols, the white-red-white flag and the coat of arms, the Pahonia, or Chase, as it is called, which have a centuries-old history behind them.\nSo the first steps have already been taken on the way to develop sovereignty expressed in the conclusion or start of the negotiating processes with contiguous States - Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania - a desire to build bilateral relations with our neighbours and other States on an equal footing.\nThe Republic of Belarus is counting on support from the world community for its initiatives and is hoping to establish full inter-State relations, to develop mutually advantageous cooperation in all areas with all interested States.\nThese days we are often asked, what guidelines will Belarus use in its foreign policy? Answering the question from this lofty rostrum I would say that the vital interests of the Belarusian nation are the cornerstone of our policy in international affairs; a balanced approach and realism are components of that policy.\nBy dint of this, the foreign policy principles and priorities of the Republic of Belarus might be summarized in the following points.\nFirst, we must achieve real independence and sovereignty for our State. We must establish favourable domestic and external political conditions leading to a \\\"wave\\\" of diplomatic recognition. Yet we realize that sovereignty is not so much something that is proclaimed or declared, but rather a quality that is recognized and confirmed. For Belarus, sovereignty is not merely a goal; it is a difficult, thorny path, the historical distance of which is probably long. In no way can we slow down these processes; we would simply find ourselves on the sidelines of European development were we to do so. Nor can we speed them up, for that would lead to a dangerous divorce from reality. The Belarusian way to genuine sovereignty, as we hope, will be consistent, calm and civilised, reflecting the unshakable traditions of our tolerance and our respect for the peoples living in the territory of the Republic, taking account of the constant growth of the national self-awareness of our people. For us, sovereignty and independence, won by much suffering in our tragic history, is the desired ideal, the hope for survival in the extreme Chernobyl situation in which we now find ourselves. In fact, we have been proceeding towards this over the last centuries, and only in the late twentieth century have we really gained the eternal human right to be masters of our own land.\nThe second point is cooperation in the establishment of a unified economic space, a new union of sovereign States. We are in favour of preserving, developing and giving a new quality to traditionally established economic ties, and on this basis we favour participation in the process of creating a community of sovereign States to replace the USSR. The realistic approach Belarus has taken tells us that destroying the work of decades and establishing tariff barriers would lead to a sharp reduction in living standards and would be detrimental not to the Belarusian people alone. According to the available statistics this would mean for the sovereign republics losses of tens and hundreds of billions of roubles. Therefore the Republic of Belarus favours a common economic, energy and transport space within the former USSR, functioning on the principles of a modern, regulated market. We adhere to this approach not only in respect of the economic interaction within the borders of the former USSR but also at the global level. In this connection Belarus is following with interest the Uruguay Round being conducted under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); this is broadening the framework of the universal international trading system.\nThe third point is mobilization of international support to resolve the Chernobyl problem. This problem is of crucial importance to us because Chernobyl was the worst disaster of the twentieth century - as far as its consequences go - and will be our national tragedy for centuries to come. Everything in this world is transient. We will all disappear from it, but there will be an endless stream of new generations of Belarusians who will continue this difficult, agonizing search for answers to the most complex questions posed during those few days of April 1986 by the Chernobyl disaster. \nThat is why the Chernobyl problems have become one of the main priorities of our foreign policy. In fact Chernobyl has turned out to be a catalyst in our movement towards sovereignty. Our people, our Republic, has always been amongst the first to assist others. However, at the most difficult time of our sufferings from Chernobyl we felt that we had been left alone to face our national misfortune in a country that was being torn by many contradictions.\nTo be frank, it must be acknowledged that the socio-economic system in our country was not prepared properly to react adequately to this major nuclear disaster of the century, to this tragic challenge of history. Members can judge for themselves. During the five years since the disaster, Belarus has received from Union funds for the Republic's health care a mere 5 million foreign exchange roubles whereas its annual requirements for health care are 75 million. At the same time, the Ministry for Atomic Energy of the USSR, the main culprit of the Chernobyl disaster, in 1990 received from its export deliveries $US 650 million. All this compels us to take another look at previous assessments and approaches and to focus now on the problem of international cooperation.\nHowever, it is not a question only of assistance in that narrow, traditional, even over-simplified meaning of the word, as was the case before, with food assistance, clothing, and so on. Belarus, Ukraine and Russia now need very special equipment such as children's oncological tomographs, the latest diagnostic equipment, the most modern kinds of oncological preparations and the latest methods for treating the many diseases from which dozens of countries are suffering.\nThe tragic experience of Chernobyl, a unique planetary disaster, can be understood and handled only by the collective intellect of mankind, only through comprehensive international cooperation. In a way we have inherited the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a focal point of human suffering. The course of events has shown that practical implementation of the programme of cooperation under United Nations auspices is not easy; indeed, it has encountered obstacles.\nIn these conditions we are particularly grateful to countries that stated at the pledging conference on 20 September that they would participate financially in international programmes to mitigate the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. We are sincerely grateful to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and the United Nations Coordinator of International Cooperation for Chernobyl, Ms. Margaret Anstee, for breathing life into the well-known General Assembly resolution 45/190 and for doing so much also to convene the conference of donor countries and to coordinate future international cooperation.\nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar has constantly demonstrated a warm, friendly attitude towards Belarus and has visited our Republic. He have profound respect for him as one of the most authoritative political leaders of our time.\nThe fourth point is transformation of Belarus into a nuclear-free zone and a neutral State. I wish to stress that the achievement of this priority is dictated by the fundamental interests of our people, especially in the post-Chernobyl era. In the course of moving towards this goal proclaimed in the Declaration on State Sovereignty of Belarus, in October 1990 we put forward from this lofty rostrum the initiative of establishing a nuclear-free belt - from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, including Belarus, the three Baltic States and Ukraine. The experience of this past year has certainly shown that in putting forward that idea our evaluation of these processes was correct. Moreover, over the past year and in particular over the past month we have moved even farther towards the goal that we proclaimed than we had thought possible. A powerful catalyst for these and other processes with regard to deepening the democratisation process was the defeat of the August putsch in Moscow.\nTaking the next step forward, we are proposing today that practical consultations be held with all interested parties regarding the necessary measures to establish such a nuclear-free zone and also the procedures, methods and steps to be taken to that end, including the international legal steps. The truth is that the Belarus people is tired of being hostage to other people's military decisions. Far too often, and all too ruthlessly, our well-being, culture and future were trampled underfoot by the military boot. Today, we are doubly reluctant to be hostages to, other people's nuclear decisions. The future of the nuclear potential on the territory of Belarus, its use, deployment or re-deployment, can be and should be resolved only with the participation of Belarus, not behind its back. At the same time we state clearly that monitoring and management of nuclear weapons must of course lie with the unified centre.\nBelarus will promote the speedy ratification of agreements between the USSR and the United States on reducing nuclear arsenals.\nWhile understanding the great complexity and delicacy of the military and political problems here and knowing that their solution depends on European realities and the positions of other countries, Belarus considers it necessary to have appropriate channels for conducting the necessary international work to bring about these goals. These very considerations compelled us at the beginning of this year to address the Conference on Disarmament, working on a permanent basis in Geneva, to request membership there.\nThe fifth point concerns integrating Belarus into the all-European process.\nAt the present time we are re-analysing the problem of integrating Belarus into the Helsinki process. If Belarus, particularly in its dire post-Chernobyl situation, becomes a site for the deployment of large numbers of armaments and armies withdrawn from Central and Eastern Europe, should we not have a say in the military decisions being taken during this process? If human rights and the exercise of them in our territory are to be determined from now by the laws of Belarus and not any other acts, should we not too participate in the fashioning of the contents of the Helsinki humanitarian basket? If the economic realities for the existence of an 11-million-strong nation, including settling foreign trade problems, are now to be determined by decisions taken in Minsk, should not the capital of Belarus participate directly in fashioning the common economic space in Europe?\nWe do not see any serious obstacles to participants in the Helsinki process recognising the new realities and accepting the equal participation of Belarus in its important efforts which, to a large extent, will determine the future of the continent. The proper time for this might be the foreign- minister-level meeting of the countries of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to be held in January 1992 in Prague.\nThe times we are living in pose many new questions, and we must all give a lot of thought to them and work hard to see to it that answers to them will provide the stability that our people seek - genuine stability, not pseudo-stability; long-lasting, not fleeting stability; stability based on justice, without any discrimination. Anyone familiar with history can say that discrimination and stability are political antonyms.\nThe sixth point concerns creating conditions for establishing market structures in Belarus for its economic development.\nHe view the unequal levels of economic development as the basic destabilizing factor in Europe as well as at the global level, and today this contains the seeds of further cataclysms.\nWhat we previously called the ideological confrontation turned out to be totally surmountable, but it is being replaced by new contradictions stemming from highly unequal levels of economic development and of the conditions necessary to start and expand a market economy. Of course, they can be ignored. So far they are not as acute as the economic problems in North-South relations, but I am convinced that if we do not act now, then in a few years' time they will definitely recur. Economic migration alone can become a serious problem for all Europeans. Of course, as an antidote, the protective functions of the State, stricter visa regulations and the building of camps for displaced persons could be used, but all these administrative measures - which, by the way, can be called a kind of iron curtain - are doomed to failure, as history suggests.\nThe way to resolve many tragedies that lie in wait for peoples that have gained their long-awaited freedom should be sought in the market economy. Belarus is consciously adopting this approach, and recently a number of in-depth reforms have been implemented. He are now focusing on establishing a legal, socio-economic infrastructure for the market economy. Dozens of laws that lay down the basis for business activities have been enacted, or soon will be.\nOur serious and fundamental attitude to the market economy stems from the fact that we view it as a means of accumulating material resources for resolving many problems caused by Chernobyl. But the need at this time to concentrate enormous resources in this area is making this shift to a new type of economic activity difficult.\nThe new political and economic realities facing the Republic - further, complicated by the Chernobyl factor - have compelled us to re-evaluate the adequacy of the current contribution of Belarus to international organizations. This is a complicated methodological and political problem. But for us it is relevant, and we are prepared to engage in consultations and to have close cooperation with the appropriate organisations in order to find possible approaches to resolving it.\nThe seventh point relates to ensuring ecological security.\nUnless this is achieved, any further progress for mankind and its survival at the beginning of the third millennium will be impossible.\nIn this context, the preparations for the Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in 1992 in Brazil, are of primary importance. We must see to it that this Conference become a landmark in mankind's growing awareness of the full magnitude of the ecological threat and of coordinating for the next decades common approaches to a strategy for ecological cooperation among States.\nThe decision to create in the United Nations at the beginning of 1992, on an experimental basis, the Centre for Emergency Environmental Assistance is a clear sign of success in moving towards this new understanding of the problem.\nWe are convinced that it is high time - particularly bearing in mind the bitter lessons of Chernobyl - to think about creating, within the United Nations system, a mechanism that would be automatically triggered and provide large-scale humanitarian assistance in the case of major disasters.\nThe eighth point provides for free interchange of cultures. Here our basis is the universal value of culture; its great humanitarian function. We are convinced that culture should play a major role in the rapprochement, integration and development of mutual understanding among States and peoples.\nAccordingly, we will be playing a more active role in forming the cultural basis and preserving the heritage of Europe and the world and in restructuring our relations with our neighbours on the basis of constant cultural values and ideals and common traditions in our spiritual lives. Culture is national in its essence, but knows no boundaries. For example, the stained glass windows in the cathedrals of Reims, Prague, Krakow and those of the cathedrals of the Belarusian city of Grodno are close in their spirit and artistic form. This example demonstrates the great magnetic force of culture, its irreplaceable integrating role, and its historic mission. Belarusian culture has always been developed in the best humanitarian traditions of Europe, creating a favourable environment for the different forms of human genius.\nWe note with satisfaction that the writer F. Dostoevsky, the composers I. Stravinsky and S. Shostakovich, the artist M. Chagall, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, all had their ancestral roots in Belarus, and all made a significant contribution to the spiritual treasure house of our peoples and influenced the culture of the world with their philosophical depth, their innovative methods, their originality and individuality and refined aesthetic principles. We are determined to create conditions for the free movement of peoples, the exchange of ideas and cultural values, by preserving and developing our age-old tradition of tolerance.\nOur great Interest in the work of Agencies and organs of the United Nations system may be explained to a large extent by the fact that for many years the United Nations was for Belarus virtually the only window onto the outside world. But even in these new circumstances, when the Republic is beginning to establish and expand bilateral relations, the significance of the United Nations will endure. Therefore, we are particularly mindful of the historic role the Organisation will play in the future and we are ready to work with others to enhance its authority and prestige.\nAt this time the renaissance of the United Nations is being noted by all. Accordingly, we are renewed interest in the United Nations by the large States too, which sometimes believed the United Nations to be marginal. We are a small State and we welcome this process. Therefore, it must be noted that it reflects a living truth that if in certain sharp turning-points in history the interest in the United Nations increases, this demonstrates that it is necessary as an instrument for cooperation and mutual creative action by States.\nIt must be recognised, however, that the world has undergone a radical change. Therefore, the instruments being used by the world community must also be updated. The required changes in the United Nations can be made without shaking the foundations established in 1945, but on the basis of the new realities in our reading of the existing Charter of the Organization. We are proposing at this session of the General Assembly that a process of consultations could be initiated, the subject of which would not be merely the machinery of the General Assembly itself but, in the broader sense, the new role of the United Nations as a whole.\nIn particular, we need to establish consensus on the new role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace, and the main importance of this goes beyond resolving a specific conflict, such as what is happening now in the Persian Gulf region. In fact, there is a new understanding of the forms and methods of work of the United Nations appropriate to this particular period of world history, where the primacy of universal interests over selfish aspirations is recognised.\nThe renaissance of the United Nations is not a mere fortuitous occurrence, nor is it episodic. It has been prepared by the entire development of mankind in recent decades. The Organisation, the idea of which was clearly ahead of its time, is now in step with its time. The national State renaissance of Belarus, which we are seeing now, is no mere happenstance, nor is it a mere episode. Now is the time for embodying in practice the age-old aspirations of Belarusians, a quarter of all Slav peoples. In ancient times we were between the Varangians and the Greeks. Now we feel that we are part of the community of nations and the renaissance of Belarus is our unique contribution to the renaissance of the world family of nations. A family is truly powerful and prosperous when that time of prosperity is valid for all members.\nBlessed be the future of my native Belarus!\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\\\"Mr. President, I add my voice to the congratulations expressed by previous speakers on the occasion of your election. Your personal experience in this Organization, together with your unanimously recognized diplomatic skills, are the best guarantee for the quality of our debates.\n\\\"I must also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, for his exceptionally active role as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. His dynamism was highlighted in the course of the proceedings concerning the restructuring of certain activities of the General Assembly.\n\\\"A special word of thanks must also be addressed to the Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar. As always, his report on the work of the Organization during the past year has furnished us with an inspiring synthesis. We art grateful to the Secretary General for the ten yearn during which he has guided the United Nations with full personal commitment. A number of multilateral diplomatic successes of recent yearn bore the undeniable mark of his own input, especially where the resolution of long-standing regional conflicts is concerned. Moreover, the prospects for speedy settlements in a number of cases still pending are also due to his personal efforts. Thus, his activity has certainly contributed to translating the Organization's political revival into concrete actions in the field. \n\\\"The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Mr. van den Broeck, has already spoken here on behalf of the 12 member States of the European Community. I subscribe to his statement, and I share in his expression of the Community's views on the major questions facing us today. The wide range of his statement allows me to focus attention on a limited number of subjects.\n\\\"Before doing so, however, I wish to express my Government's satisfaction at the fact that several new Member States were admitted to our Organization at the beginning of this session. Belgium has always been in favour of universal membership of the United Nations. In that spirit, we welcome the simultaneous admission of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to membership of the Organization. The admission of new Members is even more welcome when it contributes to the lessening of regional tensions or when it reflects the fast pace of change in the world. We are convinced that the new Member States will enrich our debates with their particular insights.\n\\\"The events of recent weeks and months in the Soviet Union have accelerated and confirmed the collapse of communism. The failure of the coup has demonstrated that democratic thinking is alive and well in the Soviet Union and that perestroika could not be undone by a handful of military and KGB personnel.\n\\\"Belgium joins in the rejoicing at the victory of constitutional and legal order over the totalitarian adventurism of those in the Soviet Union who had failed to realize that the reforms initiated by President Mikhail Gorbachev had reached the point of no return.\n\\\"Would it be true, then, that the history of this twentieth century is merely a passing phase - one that has already passed? Indeed, our century has, by and large, been marked by the 1ife-and -death struggle against two evil forms of totalitarianism: fascism and communism. These two perverted forms of sociological thinking and of political action have, throughout the major part of this century, reduced hundreds of millions of individuals to conditions of mental slavery, moral exploitation and, eventually, self-destruction. These totalitarian ideologies are responsible for the loss of human lives by the millions.\n\\\"Today, it is our privilege to see, with the utmost relief and joy, this century ending in 1991 with the implosion of communism. Communism has come to an end both as a political regime and as an ideology.\n\\\"The rejection of communism by ever more people in the world means that this ideology is no longer credible as a guideline for social reform. Because of the events in the Soviet Union, democracy and the defence and exercise of freedom and basic human rights have considerably enhanced and are now quite likely to be accepted internationally. \\\"The recognition of political freedoms must, however, go hand in hand with the granting of economic freedoms. Thus we get this dual concept of democracy and a competitive market economy, which seems to be conquering the world - democracy as a political framework ensuring a socially responsible redistribution of the benefits gained through an efficient market economy.\n\\\"After the revolutionary changes in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the leaders in the Soviet Union have the historical duty to bring the democratic and economic reforms in their country to a speedy conclusion. But this task must be achieved in a spirit of international solidarity. In this regard, the European Community and its member States, including Belgium, cannot and will not shun their responsibilities. Obviously, such support cannot be seen as a substitute for the reforms democratically elected leaders in these countries must undertake. That being said, we must offer them the broadest and most effective cooperation possible.\n\\\"Moreover, the Europe of the Twelve also serves as a model: its various forms of economic cooperation among its members; and the manner in which it cooperates with third States and regions or constituent republics of third States. In this context we hope that the Soviet Union - and I stress the word 'Union' - will be able to work out a balanced formula for cooperation between its various constituent republics. \\\"National feelings harbour great energy which can be applied to good purposes as well as to evil ones. When a national feeling degenerates into nationalism, that is, into forms of collective selfishness, a destructive force can be set free. History is replete with tragic examples of this. But the national conscience of peoples able to enjoy their own language, history, culture and religion is an important asset for the world community. Without such inputs, international society would become merely a colourless mixture of stateless people.\n\\\"Personally I am convinced that the countries of the European Community, having undergone the great ordeals of the first half of this century, have cast out their nationalistic demons thanks to a policy of integration in numerous fields.\n\\\"The European Community has also given an example of how to transcend national feelings; and we are willing to assist others in seeking workable solutions for similar problems. We hope that the granting of a wide measure of autonomy will neither increase the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons nor obstruct or undermine the trend towards disarmament which, happily, exists in so many fields.\n\\\"Belgium welcomes with satisfaction the regained independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. My country never recognized their annexation by Stalin's Soviet Union. We are particularly proud that we were able to contribute to the establishment of a Baltic information centre in Brussels and that we supported their delegations in various international forums prior to their recognition under international law. We also salute the memory of those citizens of the Baltic republics who gave their lives in the struggle for independence. \\\"The events of recent months and years, so full of hope for peace and for the freedom of ever more people in the world, have also demonstrated the growing importance of human rights. The Marxist notion, according to which respect for human rights, in keeping with a materialistic logic, is seen as a consequence of a specific of socio-economic development, is now clearly being abandoned. Respect for human rights now appears to be the sine qua non for the balanced socio-economic evolution of any society. Hence there is an interaction at work between development and respect for human rights.\n\\\"There is no doubt that States individually, rather than the international community, bear the primary responsibility for the protection of human rights within their territory. But each State is responsible to the international community in cases of non-compliance with its obligations. International consensus on this issue is steadily growing: States are liable internationally for their national policies in the field of human rights. This combination of national responsibility and international liability entails an increasing internationalization of human rights issues. We therefore favour a definition of human rights which is both broad and precise.\n\\\"The individual human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration and in the two International Covenants remain the basic components of any evolving human rights policy. Consequently, these Covenants ought to be accepted and applied by all United Nations Members. Aside from the right of peoples to self-determination, more attention should now be given to the social exercise of certain individual human rights, such as cultural and religious freedom, including the elimination of ethnic and other forms of discrimination.\n\\\"Belgium continues, as in the past, to plead that we take into account the regional dimension of respect for human rights so as to enable each region to consider its cultural and socio-political idiosyncrasies in respecting fundamental rights. It is also necessary to grant special protection to persons belonging to certain social groups, such as women and children. The Convention on the Sights of the Child and the recent World Summit for Children made significant progress in that respect.\n\\\"The protection of human rights is of course a duty, but it is also a right. In signing the Charter and in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two additional Covenants, the Member States of the United Nations undertook to respect human rights within their territories.\n\\\"True exercise of State sovereignty consists not of resisting any external interference in this field, but, rather, of mobilizing of all means available to States to ensure respect for human rights. Each State has this obligation not only to its own citizens - in particular minorities within its borders - but also with regard to other States.\n\\\"In contradistinction to the position generally advocated by the now increasingly discredited totalitarian regimes, actions by third States to protect human rights should not necessarily constitute interference in domestic affairs. This is very clear in cases where actions are undertaken in response to a request by a State no longer able to ensure the protection of human rights on its own territory. But even if the action is taken without the consent of the State on whose territory human rights are violated, it is not necessarily interference in domestic matters.\n\\\"Indeed, effective respect for human rights is at the heart of the problem. The international community must help States to respect human rights, and force them to do so if need be. To prevent any abuse the Charter rightly implies that any such intervention must take place in an orderly and acceptable fashion. It should be in accordance with well-defined rules. The existence of a violation must, as a matter of principle, be clearly established. The response must be gradual and must obtain the agreement of the international community. Only in the case of actions undertaken in situations of extreme emergency should it be possible to bypass these rules until the international community itself is able to take all the necessary measures.\n\\\"This rostrum is not the appropriate place to enter into the details of a juridical exposition. Let me just point out that Article 56 of the Charter implies the possibility of interference of this kind. Each United Nations Member has committed itself to individual or collective action in defence of the principles set forth in Article 55, including the protection of human rights. All States and the international community as a whole are obliged not only to respect human rights but also to have them respected.\n\\\"Protection of human rights encompasses both combating violations and preventing them. It is the duty of Member States to ensure that basic political rights are effectively granted to their citizens, that they can participate in political decision-making, that conditions for economic growth are created, that there is the indispensable social redistribution of wealth, and that sound sanitary and ecological standards of living are achieved. Inversely, it is also true that respect for human rights contributes to political stability and to a spirit of entrepreneurship.\n\\\"Using confidential procedures, direct and indirect pressure and diplomatic interventions, third States and the international community can bring about a change of attitude by a State violating human rights. If these measures fail, the greatest leverage against those violating human rights is to be found in concern publicly expressed by third States or by pressure groups. For that reason, the work of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International must be vigorously supported.\n\\\"But the international community must also be able to intervene rapidly. The diplomatic impact of the United Nations must be strengthened, and the Organization should be able to take action at very short notice. Now more than ever before, countries should train military and civilian units required for rapid deployment within the framework of such United Nations operations.\n\\\"Moreover, Member States should whenever possible consider the inclusion of human rights clauses in international agreements, following the example of the Lome Conventions and the recent constituent Act of the new European Development Bank. Such clauses are inspired not by any type of cultural imperialism, but by our deep conviction of the interrelationship between human rights, pluralism and economic and social development. In this spirit, Belgium has recently insisted upon the introduction of the notion of respect for human rights in its bilateral agreements with States with which it maintains close traditional links of cooperation.\n\\\"The international community therefore must provide itself with sufficient means to make States violating human rights change their behaviour when confidential procedures or pressure from public opinion are ineffective. He clearly see a role for the Security Council in this field. Prior multilateral approval of interventions is desirable in almost all cases. In certain extremely urgent and flagrant cases, a State should be allowed to intervene on its own initiative to protect human rights. Such an intervention could be legitimate when, for example, citizens of that State outside its borders are subjected to gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights. Such situations generally arise in times of war or civil war, when State authority collapses, or when States obstruct the delivery of the necessary humanitarian aid. But even in those cases it is of course indispensable for the State carrying out the intervention to submit its actions within a reasonable time limit to the Security Council. Such unilateral intervention should, moreover, be discussed and monitored by the relevant regional forums.\n\\\"Existing multilateral institutions are already in a position to do a lot of useful work in this field. In the longer term an extension of legal options could be envisaged. We view the creation of an international court for human rights and the appointment of a high commissioner as the most important possible innovation.\n\\\"What we are aiming for is the establishment of a more structured mechanism to investigate individual, specific cases of human rights violations and then reach a conclusion and ensure legal redress. We are well aware that In these matters we have to attain and respect a balance between existing and future institutions, between political fields of competence and legal procedures, and between mechanisms at the national, regional and International levels. More specifically, the powers of the Commission on Human Rights may have to be reviewed to allow for transmission of the files on the worst cases of human rights violations to the Security Council.\n\\\"The international court for human rights and the high commissioner should 'filter' dossiers, thus enhancing their authority, avoiding procedural abuses and preventing overburdening the Security Council.\n\\\"Taking into account these ideas, we may envisage the following procedures: the high commissioner would have to submit complaints by States to the court, while he would have the option of submitting complaints from individuals; he would have the right of inquiry and the court would be able to summon States; if the State involved refused to collaborate, its refusal would be notified to the Commission on Human Rights; the court would determine whether the State had indeed violated human rights; the State would then be given an opportunity to acknowledge its responsibility, restore the rights concerned and make legal reparation to the victims, and if that were not done the court's judgement would be transmitted to the Commission on Human Rights.\n\\\"The Commission is a political organ which has to concentrate on the policies and practices of States violating human rights. Its effectiveness could be strengthened in, for example, the following ways. The behaviour of a State could be brought to the Commission's attention by another State, by the court or by the high commissioner. The commissioner would then check whether human rights had indeed been systematically violated. It would be entitled to order an inquiry. Refusal to collaborate would be viewed as an aggravating factor. If the Commission found that a State had indeed systematically violated certain human rights, that State should be given a short period to put the matter right. If the State did not take such action, the facts would be notified to the Security Council.\n\\\"When It is thus clearly established that a State refuses to end its violations of human rights, two further means of pressure can be envisaged. First, States can use existing unilateral means of exerting pressure, which they will have a right to apply to the extent that they have Inserted human rights clauses in their treaties with other States. A number of States will inevitably want to review their economic, political and diplomatic relations with another State on whose territory human rights are systematically violated. Secondly, if the Commission on Human Rights finds that a State persists in systematic and gross violations of human rights, that State's attitude will be brought to the attention of the Security Council for consideration.\n\\\"When we recommend the path of pluralism and respect for human rights with such insistence we may run the risk of seeming self-righteous.\n\\\"States in which democratic institutions have been functioning for generations have no other choice but continuously to watch ever the vitality of those institutions and be increasingly aware of the problems arising outside their own borders, in a spirit of solidarity.\n\\\"There, too, we face a real challenge.\n\\\"The greater attention now being devoted to the development of new East-West relations does not mean that Belgium, or indeed Europe as a whole, will forget the urgent issues pertaining to North-South relations.\n\\\"We are even more aware of the urgency of these issues since the General Assembly recently concluded its assessment of the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. Criticism has been levelled, rightly, at the implementation of this Programme.\n\\\"We must not forget that the economic situation of many developing countries is also linked with the political reforms they are currently undertaking. Our aid must be adjusted accordingly, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\\\"It is also becoming increasingly clear that we need to envisage a new relationship between donor countries and recipient countries, taking into account the interdependence of the world economy. We must also find an acceptable level of economic growth, while giving due attention to its adverse side effects, especially for the environment.\n\\\"I cannot close without emphasizing that the past year has been exceptional for our Organization. The widening of its role and the extent of its intervention in the political world order would have been inconceivable only a few years ago. Having for long pleaded for a return to the spirit which inspired the authors of the Charter, we find ourselves now to some extent prisoners of our own words. The Members of the United Nations are capable of uniting their will-power and assuming with determination their responsibility for peace, human dignity and social progress.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff \n\n\n\n \nMr. President, permit me to congratulate you, in the name of the Ghana delegation, on your election to the highest office of the General Assembly and, for that matter, of our Organisation. Your qualifications, experience and proven diplomatic skill assure us of a vary rewarding and successful tenure. It gives us added pleasure. In view of the close and cordial relations between our two countries, to see you presiding over this session. We wish to assure you of our cooperation at all times.\nI should also like to place on record our appreciation of the devoted commitment to duty which your predecessor demonstrated during his entire tenure. As Chairman of the Group of 11, we had the opportunity to work closely with Mr. Guido de Marco; and we wish to note the impressiveness of his firm grasp of the intricate issues of multilateral diplomacy and his ability to create consensus out of seemingly irreconcilable positions.\nWhen we last met here to reflect on the international situation, the high hopes of the world for peace and development after the relaxation of cold-war tensions risked being dashed in the face of the threat of war in the Gulf. In spite of world-wide appeals for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, sadly, war broke out.\nThe damage that the war has caused to man and his environment is yet to be fully assessed. The immediate consequences of the war - many dead, the untold suffering of the bereaved, the displaced and the dispossessed, the unparalleled environmental degradation that the burning fires of Kuwait inflict on the region - testify to the fragility of a world that builds its peace on might alone or solely on the concept of deterrence. That the war occurred at all reminds us of the distance that still lies before us on the\n\nroad to full international peace and security. He are compelled to work diligently for the establishment of a truly just international order founded on the noble and valid principles enshrined in the Charter of our Organisation, an order that will command and enjoy general legitimacy.\nThe time for such an order is very much now. The end of the global ideological division has unbound many promises. From grass roots to leaders in Eastern Europe, the yearning has been articulated for a greater and more rewarding interaction with the rest of the world.\nAnother significant step forward towards securing international peace and security was achieved when President Bush and President Gorbachev signed the strategic arms reduction treaty (START) on 31 July this year in Moscow to reduce their stocks of intercontinental ballistic missiles. He congratulate them and urge them to strive towards involving all nuclear States in order to rid our world of such deadly weapons and offer assurance against their proliferation or manufacture by others.\nA reunited Germany has now taken its place in the world and is poised to become an important factor for peace and development. The peoples of Yemen have put behind them years of misunderstanding and now stand united in one country, the Republic of Yemen. Independent Namibia has consolidated its political freedom as a valuable member of our world body.\nHe have at this session witnessed the admission of seven new Members into our Organisation as sovereign independent States. He take this opportunity to welcome them warmly and we share their pride and aspirations. He hope that their membership in our Organization will provide the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea with yet another forum for dialogue and shared understanding that will pave the way to the eventual unification of the two Koreas.\n\nThe forces of change that the and of the cold war has unleashed upon the world continue to make their Impact across the entire globe. The conflict In Angola appears to be coming to an end. In Cambodia, the momentum that the United Nations Peace Plan generated is gathering speed. Tentative steps towards peace In Afghanistan and El Salvador are evident.\nWe must also note with appreciation the initiative President Bush has taken to bring a more-lasting peace to Cyprus. The situation of \\\"no peace, no war\\\", though preferable to an outbreak of war, cannot prevail forever. We call on all concerned to cooperate in this laudable initiative.\nUnder the aegis of the United Nations, Western Sahara has hopefully entered the last stage of a final, definitive solution. We call upon both sides to give the United Nations-sponsored programme a chance to usher peace into the region.\nIn Liberia, the efforts of ECOMOG, the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have helped to halt the senseless killing that threatened to tear the country apart. We call upon the international community to provide the necessary material and financial support for this international effort. Above all, we wish to appeal to the leaders of the various factions in Liberia to seek resolution of their differences without further recourse to arms.\nThe seemingly intractable Middle East crisis has begun to respond to some important initiatives. It is a matter of course that durable peace can only be achieved through the involvement of all parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, in the negotiating process.\nThe spirit of cooperation and dialogue that has prevailed over the atmosphere of confrontation and mutual recrimination has presented the United \nNations with new opportunities. The enhanced role that the Organisation has been called upon to play in the efforts of Member States to build a solid foundation for peace and development has been innovative and exciting. He wish to place on record our sincere appreciation for the work of our Secretary General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, and his team of dedicated assistants in the cause of world peace and development. Although the end of the cold war has benefited the cause of peace all over the world, much remains to be done to secure this peace.\nWith regard to the nations around which some of the big Powers have placed economic blockades, we wish to state that the end of the cold war calls for the expansion of detente, for dialogue and discourse, so that all nations can become part of a global family in which none shall be castigated for holding views that are contrary to the dominant concepts of government and economic management.\nToday, South Africa stands knocking at the door to be allowed to re-enter the comity of nations. The repeal of the legislative pillars of apartheid, at least in theory, indicates that apartheid is in the process of being dismantled. The scrapping of the infamous Population Registration Act has established the possibility for basic equality in South Africa. The people of South Africa, however, are yet to enjoy an atmosphere conducive to free and meaningful negotiation. The recent disclosures about the clandestine military and financial support given by the National Party regime to the Inkatha Movement and the state-supported violence against members of the African National Congress have confirmed our often-stated doubts about the total and unquestionable commitment of the regime to the complete eradication of apartheid.\n\nIt in thus a matter of regret and concern to the people and the Government of Ghana that certain Member States of the United Nations have unilaterally decided to suspend the measures agreed upon and affirmed by consensus by the Organisation in the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, adopted on 14 December 1989 at the sixteenth special session of the General Assembly. It has often been said that General Assembly resolutions have no binding effect and that they are largely recommendations to Member States. However, the credibility of the Organisation requires that Member States endeavour to comply with conclusions reached in a democratic way.\nHe expect this session to reach conclusions that would not countenance any attempt designed to perpetuate apartheid in any other form. He need not equivocate on our abhorrence of racism and racial discrimination in any guise. He have to remind the racist regime continuously of our determination to ensure the eradication of apartheid. This is a moral responsibility from which we cannot escape. At the same time, we must not forget the senseless killings in Mozambique initiated by apartheid South Africa. Every effort has to be made to secure the cooperation of the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) rebels in the search for peace.\nThe manifestations of ethnic rivalry, particularly in Europe, would test to the limit the spirit of tolerance and mutual understanding that should mark the post-cold-war era. He welcome the efforts being made to bring peace to the friendly State of Yugoslavia. Similarly, it is our view that satisfactory arrangements should be made to guarantee peace in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This peace, it is our hope, will be based on the need to preserve the brotherly ties that link the republics of that great country.\n\nIt will only serve the cause of global disorder if the rest of the world is heard or seen to be supporting the forces of anarchy and disunity in that country.\nWhile our efforts at disarmament and the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts must continue, these efforts in themselves cannot offer lasting solutions unless we tackle another fundamental threat to international peace and security - namely, global poverty.\nThe statistics on world poverty provided by a number of institutions, including those in the United Nations system, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Department of International Economic and Social Affairs (DIESA), continue to be disturbing. In its Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries 1991, the World Bank persuasively demonstrates the growing interdependence of the economies of industrialised and developing countries. For their 70 per cent share of world trade and output, the industrialised countries depend upon the developing countries for one quarter of their export sales, one fifth of their primary commodity inputs and nearly one half of their petroleum supplies. Sixty per cent of the trade and 47 per cent of the primary commodity inputs of the developing countries lie with the industrialised countries. Yet 70 per cent of world income is produced and consumed by 15 per cent of the world's population in the industrialized countries. The competition that has been forced upon 85 per cent of the world's population for the remaining 30 per cent of world income has consigned 41 least developed countries to an average annual per capita income of $300. This stands in striking contrast to the average annual per capita income of $14,500 in the industrialized countries.\nGhana) The impact of technological innovation in the industrialised countries will doubtless widen this gap. Assessments by international agencies point to the dangers of this ever-widening world disparity. In its overall perspective of the world economy up to the year 2000, DIESA foresees the prevalence of a state of disequilibrium, with internal and external imbalances in most regions. The World Bank suggest that the divergent patterns of growth observed in the 1980s will probably continue into the next decade. And the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has already described the 1980s as a \\\"lost decade\\\" to the Member States of its region.\nThe 85 per cent of the world's population that lives on 30 per cent of the world's income are not asking the world's 15 per cent for charity. We do recognise our primary and ultimate responsibility for our own development. There is clear evidence that in many instances some of us have achieved in decades what it took some of the industrialized countries centuries to achieve. Some have adopted socially and politically difficult economic restructuring and reform measures. It is increasing factor of external influences that are beyond our control has, moreover, inhibited these efforts.\nThe international economic order, including the global financial and trade arrangements, that we were ushered into at independence still exploits our economies. Our restructuring and reform measures have in most cases resulted in increased production and productivity, but with diminishing returns. The unfavourable terms of trade, marked by falling commodity prices and increasing prices of industrial goods and services, coupled with high fiscal deficits in the industrialized countries and high international interest rates, have made debt-servicing a major burden on our fragile economies. In a situation where from 45 per cent to 80 per cent of export\n\nearnings are diverted into debt-servicing, the prospect of many of our economies regressing into a state of subsistence is not idle speculation.\nThe concern that the international community, through the General Assembly, has shown over the accelerating degradation of the global environment and the drug menace should encourage us to appreciate the unsustainability of the world's development models and life-styles. While in the industrialised countries it is prosperity that is at the root of environmental degradation, in the developing countries it is poverty that accounts for that state of affairs.\nThe depletion of the ozone layer that leads to global warming is the direct consequence of industrialization in the developed world. In the developing world, the necessity to eke out existence from the land and water has shown up as desertification and pollution. The Beijing Declaration of June this year aptly recognized that the inequities in current international economic relations not only have constrained the economic development of the developing countries, but have also undermined their capability to participate effectively in global environmental efforts. Resolution 44/226, which the General Assembly adopted last year, provided relevant guidelines for global discussions on the transfer of technology and financial resources, and should safely guide our discussions preparatory to and during the international Conference on Environment and Development.\nIt is again poverty in the developing countries that largely explains the resort to drug trafficking. Ghana has, without hesitation, joined in the international effort against the drug menace. We have passed laws that prescribe severe penalties, including confiscation of property, huge monetary fines and long prison terms. We have also adopted policy measures aimed at\nthe rehabilitation of addicts and at discouraging the production and use of drugs. Me are, however, not unmindful of the fact that the success of the global efforts depends on an overall balanced growth of the world economy.\nA world that sincerely desires peace would have to rethink its attitude towards the present global economic imbalances. Poverty is a grim enemy of peace. Within the framework of gains from the demise of the cold war, we must strive to change the unfair international economic order. First of all, developing countries have to be relieved of the debt burden. Both the debt stock and the debt service must be reduced or eliminated completely. The recommendations of the Secretary-General's Expert Group on Africa's debt would have to be given serious consideration. Moreover, all measures that would stabilise commodity prices and promote the transfer of financial resources and technology to the mutual benefit of the industrialised and the developing countries will have to be taken.\n\nIt is important to stress the inextricable links between political and economic developments at the international level, to underscore the need to make full use of the present favourable international situation and to lay the foundation for a lasting peace. It is tempting, for some, to see the ideological collapse of Eastern Europe as a victory for the inequitable global economic system that consigns the majority of the world to poverty. It has been remarked, more than once, that the industrial countries do not need the developing countries. There is nothing further from the truth. Developing countries may not command the arsenals of destruction that compel attention, but we are an essential part of a common interdependent world.\nThat interdependent world calls for increasing solidarity and cooperation. And nowhere is this more poignantly reflected than in the Accra Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement, which examines a world in transition from diminishing confrontation to increasing cooperation. Recognising that the unprecedented new vistas for peace demand new strategies of cooperation, the Non-Aligned Movement, which is today the Council of the Majority, pledges to do what such cooperation in fairness requires of members of the Movement as we demand what justice and equity entitle us to.\nThe Accra Declaration places new emphasis on the eradication of poverty, hunger, malnutrition and illiteracy. It urges the international community to match its will, determination and resources against these enemies of humanity. The Declaration calls, in that regard, for special attention to be paid to the monumental problems of Africa, which the world ignores at its peri1.\nThe non-aligned perception of a new system of international relations is one which is rooted in the principles of the United Nations Charter, and in\nwhose crafting the Hon-Aligned Movement, the Council of the Majority, needs to play a more Important and effective role, if that new system is to command legitimacy and acceptance.\nThe new world order does not call for the capitulation of the third world to any super-Power even in a unipolar world, and the Hon-Aligned Movement has no room for those who covet the distinction of being wards of super-Powers. At Accra, the Hon-Aligned Movement reaffirmed the continued relevance of the Movement as a free association of sovereign, independent States which recognise that there are third-world political and economic concerns that must be reflected on the international agenda. As part of that agenda, the Conference included the promotion of political pluralism and respect for human rights, whatever some detractors may say to the contrary. However, there is no basis for making the promotion of these values new conditionalities for international economic cooperation. And it must be admitted that the notion that development is not possible without them has no historical foundation.\nIn the non-aligned perception of a new world order, a revitalized North-South dialogue becomes urgent and compelling. The Group of 77, which Ghana is honoured to lead this year, stands ready to engage in constructive negotiations with the developed countries on the basis, we hope, of the shared objective of making the international economic order just and equitable so that all can realize their legitimate aspirations for better standards of living.\nThe Accra Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement is not alone in recognizing the primacy of development to international peace and security. In its The World Development report 1991, the World Bank vividly captures the mood of the times when it opens its 290-page report with the sentence \\\"Development is the most important challenge facing the human race\\\". The new\nencyclical \\\"Centesimus Annus\\\" of Pope John Paul II actions this same opinion when it states\n\\\"... the new name for peace is development. Just as there is a collective responsibility for avoiding war, so too there is a collective responsibility for promoting development.\\\"\nIn the discharge of that collective responsibility, let us not see some of us as irritating and nagging intruders, parasites or lazy people seeking only to consume what others have produced. Developing countries only ask for the right to development within a just international economic order. That if also most vital for a peaceful world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to your high post. Your long experience of international affairs and your diplomatic skills, which are well known to your colleagues, will serve this Assembly well. Our warm relations with your country and with yourself will make working with you a pleasure.\nMay I also pay tribute to your predecessor - Malta's Foreign Minister, Guido de Marco - for his proficient leadership of the General Assembly at its last session. \nThis last year has seen a great expansion of the role of the United Nations and an enhancement of its stature that are most gratifying to us. Among the most recent examples in this connection is the sensitive role the Secretary-General has been playing regarding the hostages held in the Middle East, and we pray that through his efforts they may soon all be released. His quiet diplomatic skills, patience and integrity have contributed in no small measure to the renewed vigour of the United Nations. We thank him for his wise and compassionate leadership over these past difficult, but momentous, 10 years and we wish him well in his future endeavours. He will leave a much more vital Organization and a strengthened role for his successor. Whoever that might be, he will be able to depend on Samoa's continued faith and active support of the Organization.\nThe number of Members of the United Nations is increasing, and during this session of the General Assembly we have been pleased to welcome seven new Members to the Organization.\nFirst of all, it gives us a great deal of satisfaction and joy to welcome fellow nations of the Pacific and the Pacific Rim to the United Nations. Both the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands are, like Samoa, members of the South Pacific Forum, and it is a special pleasure to see them joining us in this international forum as well. We know from working with them in the region that they will add to the vitality of the United Nations and contribute to the attainment of its objectives.\nWe have long supported the admission of the Republic of Korea to United Nations membership, and it pleases us to see this finally achieved. We believe in the advantages of universality and, with the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea both belonging to the United\nNations, we feel that an environment will be provided for reconciliation between them.\nWe also welcome the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - States we know will make a worthy contribution to our work. They were, of course, members of the League of Nations, and their proud histories and indomitable spirits well qualify them for membership.\nLast year we spoke of the immense speed at which world events were moving. This year there has indeed been an acceleration of the pace, and we are witnessing the beginning of an era of a courageous new world; a world that requires the utmost understanding, patience, compassion and flexibility of its leaders; a world where the voice of the people is becoming paramount and wise leaders listen. Democracy is resolutely on the march across the globe and, as evidenced by the recent events in the USSR and also in the Gulf, those that stand in its way only seem to hasten its pace. He see all about us the breakdown of repression and old tyrannies.\nDemocracy and freedom are spreading swiftly throughout Eastern Europe, where the Iron Curtain once barred the way, and there is now new hope for peoples once denied them. Sadly, violence continues in Yugoslavia. We welcome the Security Council resolution on this matter and endorse the arms embargo. We hope that the European plan succeeds in bringing peace to the country.\nI am encouraged that in South Africa the repressive apartheid system shows signs of ending. Where for so many years the world's entreaties fell on deaf ears, finally there is movement forward. Though the South African Government's proposals for a new constitution leave much to be desired, it evident that the South African Government can no longer deny the basic rights of the majority of its people nor the direction the country must take. It would seem that even in that most intransigent bastion of racism at long last movement is beginning on the road to democracy. It is our hope that now that a peace agreement has been signed by the parties, steady progress will continue and not be set back by violence or retrograde steps.\nIn the Middle East the pace has also quickened; a Middle East peace conference is expected to begin this month, an eventuality many thought to be far in the future if indeed it would occur at all. This is the outcome not only of the new international order but of determined and enlightened diplomacy, and we are hopeful for the success of this peace initiative led by the United States. While many key procedural issues remain open, this opportunity to begin the healing of old wounds must be given every chance to succeed, with all parties represented and policies that could impede its progress discontinued. In Lebanon too there has been some progress; the civil war has finally ceased. Lebanon, however, must be allowed to rebuild without foreign forces on its soil or domination from others.\nIn Cambodia events move steadily forward towards a comprehensive political settlement, and the new developments in this process are very pleasing. The United Nations must maintain its strong presence in the achievement of peace for Cambodia and Indo-China.\nWe hope that the proposed conference on the Cyprus dispute will take place as planned. The Secretary-General will bring to that conference his vast experience and skills and we wish him success in his efforts to find a solution.\nIn Afghanistan and Western Sahara we trust that the work of the Secretary-General, the resolve of the United Nations and the positive undertakings by the United States and the Soviet Union and the parties concerned will restore the processes of peace in these countries.\nIn all these events, the trend is a drive for freedom through self- determination, more representative government, and individual rights. We confirm our belief in the rights of people freely to decide for themselves what they want. In our country we have practised representative participation in elections since independence, but in accordance with the requirements of our customs and traditions. Only this year did we implement universal suffrage after our people had made a conscious choice by referendum that universal suffrage should become part of our way of life.\nWe have watched and noted the important work of the United Nations in eliminating abuses of individual freedom around the world, in particular in Central America, where most recently the protagonists in the long-lived civil war have finally signed a peace agreement. Samoa's hope is that it will be able to participate more actively in the worthy work of the Commission on Human Rights, and we enthusiastically support the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights in Berlin in 1993.\nWhile the United Nations has been successful in supporting freedom and individual rights, a matter that casts a shadow over the integrity of our approach is the long-standing resolution 3379 (XXX) adopted in 1975, which states that Zionism is racism. Learned speakers at this rostrum have expounded the anomalous nature of this resolution and we join in the call for its reconsideration. \nIt is sometimes suggested that with the end of the global bipolarism that drove the arms, the need for arms control and disarmament is now less urgent. To the contrary, my Government feels that we should not be complacent and should seize the opportunity created by new world conditions to hasten the progress of disarmament. The announcement by the United States that it plans to retire a large part of its nuclear arsenal and the very positive response of the Soviet Union are promising developments. We applaud these moves, which are substantial advances in the nuclear-disarmament process. We look forward to similar positive steps from the other nuclear-weapons Powers.\nWe welcome the decisions of China and France to become parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and are pleased that other countries have recently done so. It is important that this Treaty and the safeguards it establishes be strengthened and observed. The events in Iraq and the information uncovered by the Special Commission in its inspections abundantly highlighted this need.\nConcluding a comprehensive test-ban treaty remains an urgent priority. We think the circumstances are now conducive for the nuclear Powers to take steps to negotiate such a treaty, and we urge them to do so. A comprehensive test-ban treaty would reinforce global non-proliferation efforts. In our region, we have the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which also makes an important contribution in addressing nuclear non-proliferation; and we renew our plea to the United States, France and the United Kingdom to become parties to its protocols.\nThe Gulf conflict has served to focus attention on the dangerous proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction as well. We can clearly see that there is an urgent need to achieve a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention at the earliest possible date. While no chemical weapons are produced in the South Pacific, we have been forced to grapple with the issue of the disposal of toxic agents from such weapons in our region.\nWe were pleased to see the support given at the recent Biological Weapons Convention Review Conference to strengthening the current regime and we wish to see it become universal.\nEqually, the instability brought about by the huge and un-monitored accumulations of conventional weapons calls for urgent measures. The merchants of death, the arms dealers, are operating on ever-larger and more efficient scales. The resulting weapons build-ups contribute to regional and ultimately global insecurity. We therefore support the proposal for a United Nations-based register on arms transfers. Transparency in the conventional-arms trade could be the launching pad for more ambitious measures at a later date.\nWhile disarmament should lead to a more peaceful way of life on earth, this peace will be of little use to us if the quality of life generally continues to be destroyed by our lack of respect for the environment. We have heard colleagues from low-lying island countries speak of the threat of the rise in sea level to their very existence. That is the reality of the situation at its grimmest. Even we in the relative safety of our higher islands could still lose most of our coastal land.\nWe must indeed learn and practice respect for the living systems of which mankind is but a part. For this reason we attach great importance to the convening of the first-ever \\\"Earth Summit\\\", as it is being called. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development taking place in Brazil next year is an opportunity for serious stock-taking of the world's resources. It is a chance to assess the damage already done and to plan immediate preventive measures. We must strive to maintain an ecologically sound environment whilst ensuring that sustainable development is accelerated for the benefit of both humankind and the planet. \\\"Eco-development\\\" is no trendy catchword; it is essential if we and the Earth are to survive and prosper.\nWe wish to place on record our appreciation to the United Nations Environment Programme for the coordination of the Conference preparations and in particular for their assistance with national statements for countries of our region.\nEnvironmental matters are certainly of great concern to the Pacific. We are pleased to report that the South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP) has been strengthened into a fully autonomous regional organization, with its headquarters in our capital, Apia. Several important environmental conventions are in force in the region. These are the Convention for the Protection of Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region; the SPREP Convention and its associated Protocol for Combating Pollution Emergencies and the Prevention of Pollution by Dumping; and the Convention on the Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific, the Apia Convention.\nIn addition, the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty expresses our strong opposition to nuclear weapons and their testing in the region. The reasons for such tests have become even more obscure to us, with reduced global tensions and the dramatic progress that has been made in disarmament. The immediate and pressing concern is the danger that these tests pose to the fragile environment in which they take place.\nThe Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific has also recently entered into force. Marine resources provide an essential part of the life-support system of the island countries of the Pacific, and Samoa is pleased that the importance of their conservation is now being realised. He welcome the ongoing implementation of the General Assembly resolution on driftnet fishing and look forward to the global cessation of such practices in accordance with the time-frame set by the United Nations. We welcome the undertakings that have already been made in this regard and we hope that not only driftnet fishing but all other techniques that are proven threats to the conservation of the resources in question be dealt with firmly.\n\nA matter that continues to require our attention in the region is New Caledonia. The United Nations has adopted a Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial peoples and is committed to the eradication of colonialism by the year 2000. In this regard, we are encouraged by the measures to promote political, economic and social development taken by France under the Matignon Accords to prepare the way for the act of self-determination in 1998.\nWe also welcome the willingness of the Government of France to accept the Forum Ministerial Committee, which recently visited New Caledonia. Its report was both informative and constructive, and we believe that further visits should be facilitated.\nThe ending of the cold war has political change and reform around the world moving at a crisp pace. It also means that the United Nations has an increasingly important role in ensuring security and preventing crises from escalating into tragedies, as happened in the Gulf War. Guardianship of the peace is paramount and the Secretary-General's call for preventive diplomacy by the United Nations must be supported. \nDiminishing world tensions, new-found freedom and the enlightened spirit of cooperation provide new hopes of opportunities for all to fulfil their reasonable aspirations. But hope can be easily dashed and turn to bitterness if an adequate degree of economic well-being is not achieved and poverty sets in. Clearly, priority must be given to providing conditions to meet economic objectives. A cornerstone factor is trade - liberalized trade. The Assembly has repeatedly heard the call made for the successful and urgent completion of the Uruguay Round, and we add our voice to that call.\nEconomic security is the key to our success in preventing future conflicts. Without it, the stability we have worked so hard to achieve in our individual countries and in the world would be in grave danger of disintegrating. In our region, attaining and maintaining levels of economic development to meet the growing needs of our people is not an easy task for small nations of the Pacific, including Samoa. What we have achieved, as late entrants into the modern world of economics and international commerce, has been to a considerable extent due to the willing cooperation of the family of nations. The relative stability enjoyed by our country and our region has been the result of our combined effort, and we thank each and every nation for their contributions to our development. We hope that we can continue to count on their support in the partnership we have forged.\nIt is appropriate that we are addressing the Assembly in the week which includes the International Day for Natural Disaster Seduction, because disasters, either man-made or natural, are phenomena which, because of the small size of our island nations, have a cruel effect on us. Our region, like some others, is particularly prone to cyclones and earthquakes. Besides the threat they pose to life and damage to the environment, at their worst they are capable of plunging agrarian-based economies like ours into severe decline. We therefore fully support any undertaking by the United Nations to improve its disaster arrangements. We would suggest, however, that it is essential that these arrangements go beyond Immediate relief and, as well, address disaster-mitigation measures and rehabilitation requirements adequately.\nI and all of our colleagues have spoken of our successes, but we have also identified the numerous problems and challenges that are the reason for the existence of this Institution, the United Nations. Together we can agree on standards of conduct, within our individual countries and amongst our family of nations, to resolve disputes and maintain peace. We have asked the United Nations to assume a greater role in many areas, including peace-keeping and monitoring, mediation and verification, and enhancement of economic security and stability. We must give it the support required to carry out these roles.\nWe are at one of the pivotal moments in history when the direction of the world can be changed for the better. Too often in the past, when we stood at the crossroads, we have been too preoccupied with our disagreements and narrow perspectives to grasp the opportunity. We have the chance now to leave the legacy of a secure world to our children; it must not be lost.\nSamoa looks forward with great pride and expectation to the achievements which will be initiated by this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to extend my heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi upon his election as President of the General Assembly at this historic forty-sixth session. I am pleased also to have this opportunity to express my respects and appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco for the very able manner in which he presided over the forty-fifth session.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Japan, I wish to extend a hearty welcome to the countries that have been newly admitted to United Nations membership: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania. With these seven new Member States and with the Cambodia an Supreme National Council occupying its country's seat, I am glad to see the Organization's enhanced universality at the very time when the United Nations may be expected finally to attain the high ideals held for it since its founding.\nLastly, I wish to pay a high tribute to the Secretary-General for the important contributions he has made for world peace.\nIn a span of just two years the world has undergone a historic change with the end of the cold war and with the Gulf crisis. The international community is thus in a historic time of transition as efforts are being made to fashion a new world order. Now, as the world moves from confrontation to cooperation, tremendous possibilities are opening up for human progress.\nThis shift has provided new impetus for the resolution of regional issues through dialogue. It is clear that the process of bringing an end to the Gulf crisis has had a favourable impact on progress towards the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the Middle East, Cambodia, Western Sahara, Angola, Central America, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Prospects for the future are bright in Europe as well, with the 1992 integration of the European Community and Its link-up with the European Free Trade Association, and the return of the East European States to the European fold.\nAt the same time, however, it must be recognised that the world is beset by the uncertainty and instability common to any time of transition. There is also the danger that religious, ethnic, territorial and other disputes may resurface as the cold war structure is dismantled. The Gulf crisis was resolved through the resolute action of the international community, and it is essential hereafter that we fully understand the characteristic features of this time of transition and respond unerringly. In this respect, Japan is profoundly concerned about developments in Yugoslavia and supports the efforts of the European Community and others to mediate a peaceful resolution to that conflict.\nThe situation that is emerging in the Soviet Union is one of historic transition toward the universal values of freedom and democracy as we approach the twenty-first century. Home to three-fourths of the Earth's population, many of the world's developing countries continue to suffer from the problems of grinding poverty, sluggish growth, burgeoning debt and population growth. It is the responsibility of the International community to work for sustained development in these countries.\nIn addition, with increasing interdependence, humankind is faced with a spate of problems, such as those concerning the global environment, refugees, drugs and terrorism, which no one country or region can solve on its own but for whose solution we must all join together, on the basis of the realization that the world is one. At this historic time of transition, each country throughout the world is called upon to forge a new approach appropriate to the new era, and then all must work together in a shared effort to create a new world order.\nWith a sense of sincere contrition over the past war, the Japanese people are resolutely determined never again to become a military Power. In the more than 40 years since the Second World War, while striving to attain the level of development that it enjoys today, Japan has worked tirelessly, through a wide range of economic and other exchanges, to translate into actual policies the philosophy of living, and the resolve to live, as a nation of peace.\nIn considering the circumstances that enabled Japan to achieve its present prosperity in an international climate of peace, I believe that the new international order that we seek must be one that strives, first, to ensure peace and security; secondly, to respect freedom and democracy; thirdly, to guarantee world prosperity through open market economies; fourthly, to preserve an environment in which all people can lead rewarding lives; and, fifthly, to create stable international relations founded upon dialogue and cooperation.\nThese goals are basic tenets of Japanese policy and are consistent with the purposes of the United Nations as set forth in its Charter. In this new era of collaboration and cooperation, the United Nations will be expected to play a central role in surmounting the many challenges facing the international community. This view was also expressed in the Political Declaration of the London summit.\nDedicated to peace in full recognition of its past experiences and cognizant of the global responsibilities that accrue as a result of its economic strength, Japan has a historic mission to make the maximum possible contribution to our common efforts to achieve the goals of the new world order.\nThe international community coalesced magnificently around the United Nations in response to the crisis in the Gulf. Japan, too, extended maximum cooperation to the efforts of the countries concerned to restore peace to the Gulf and to the front-line countries hard hit by the economic dislocations resulting from the war. As a result of Japan's participation in this international response to the blatant challenge to the rule of law and the violation of peace, there developed among the Japanese people a heightened awareness that, as a peace-loving country, Japan has an obligation to contribute actively to efforts led by the United Nations to secure and maintain world peace. Accordingly, after the cease-fire Japan dispatched to the Gulf region Japanese disaster relief teams to address environmental problems and to provide refugee relief, and also dispatched minesweepers to ensure navigational safety in the Gulf.\nAlthough a ceasefire is in effect, numerous problems remain, including the questions of establishing international borders, of monitoring the cease-fire, of Battling the reparations issue, and of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The resolution of these issues has been entrusted to the United Nations. It is essential that Iraq faithfully comply with all Security Council resolutions so as to facilitate their smooth and prompt implementation, and that it cooperate with the work of the Special Commission on the destruction of weapons of mass destruction. Likewise, recognising that all Member States have an obligation to support these tasks of the United Nations actively, Japan will continue to be unstinting in its support.\nThe Gulf crisis is past, but for the sake of long-term regional stability, it is essential that remaining issues, such as the problem of peace in the Middle East and the security of the Gulf, be resolved. This will require the active involvement of the international community as a whole, respecting the initiatives and wishes of the countries in the region. Through the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union, progress is now being made towards holding an international conference on peace in the Middle East, and we very much hope that all of the parties concerned will strive to conduct these negotiations flexibly and realistically and that they will succeed in their shared endeavour.\nJapan intends to intensify its dialogue with the parties concerned and to extend all possible and appropriate cooperation to efforts to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace, in line with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nThere are a number of lessons to be learned from the Gulf crisis. The first of these is that once armed conflict erupts it inevitably causes tremendous human suffering and takes vast amounts of human and material resources to resolve. From this it is clear that conflict prevention is a matter of special urgency and deserves highest priority. If the United Nations is to be able to engage effectively in preventive diplomacy, it is essential that the Secretary-General, the Security Council and the General Assembly each function effectively within their realms of responsibility.\nIn an effort to add substance to the draft declaration on fact-finding by the United Nations that has been submitted at this session of the General Assembly, and to enable the Secretary-General, with the support of the Security Council and others, to move vigorously at a very early stage to prevent conflict, Japan would like to propose the establishment of a conflict-prevention system based on the following measures.\nFirst, the Secretariat's ability continuously to monitor and analyse information relating to possible conflicts should be substantially strengthened. Secondly, on-site fact-finding missions should be dispatched. Thirdly, early warnings should be issued as the situation requires. Fourthly, good offices and mediation efforts should be undertaken under the authority of the Secretary-General. Japan hopes to work together with other Member States during this session of the General Assembly for the early establishment of an effective system for conflict prevention.\nThe second lesson to be learned from the Gulf crisis is that the amassing of massive arsenals by one country through the international transfer and proliferation of weapons contributes to aggressive behaviour when such actions are tied to that country's political aims. Thus, the most important issue in the wake of the Gulf crisis is that of strengthening efforts in the fields of the international transfer of conventional weapons and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. This is an area in which Japan has long taken active initiatives.\nThere is an urgent need to establish a United Nations reporting system that would enhance the transparency of such international transfers of conventional weapons. Japan has advocated the establishment of just such a system since March of this year. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced at the Kyoto Conference on disarmament issues in May that Japan would be submitting a draft resolution to this effect to the General Assembly at this session. At present, we are consulting with the countries of the European Community and others concerned, and re hard at work drafting this draft resolution. Given the importance of establishing such a system as soon as possible, I very much hope it will find wide support throughout the General Assembly.\nRecognising that there may be some technical issues involved in ensuring that such a system operates smoothly, we are prepared to cooperate with the United Nations in hosting a meeting next year in Japan to elaborate these issues. Likewise, should the need arise, we are also prepared to offer appropriate cooperation to enhance the database capabilities of the Department for Disarmament Affairs for the implementation of this system.\nAs the only country to have suffered the devastation of atomic weapons, Japan is working for the ultimate abolition of all nuclear arms and has proposed a step-by-step approach to the cessation of nuclear testing. I pay a high tribute to the United States and the Soviet Union for having concluded the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty this year. I hope that still further efforts will be made towards nuclear disarmament. At the same time, I would point out in regard to the current situation in the Soviet Union that the international community very much hopes that that country will ratify and fulfil its treaty obligations in the field of arms control and will maintain the strictest control over its nuclear arsenals.\nFurthermore, it is very important that the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) gain greater universality, and I have long called upon all countries that have not yet done so to accede to this Treaty. I am sincerely gratified by France's decision to sign the NPT; by China's announcement, during Prime Minister Kaifu's recent visit, of its intention to become a party to it; and by South Africa's accession to it. I very much hope that France, China and all other countries that have not yet done so will become parties to the NPT promptly and that the Treaty will be extended wall beyond 1995.\nIn order to strengthen the NPT, it is also important to reinforce and improve the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and for this purpose Japan has proposed a system which includes the use of special inspections. It is deplorable that there is still a country that is a party to the MPT but has not yet concluded a safeguards agreement as called for by the Treaty, and I hope that this situation will be rectified as soon as possible.\nOn the question of chemical weapons, as I stressed in the statement I delivered at the Conference on Disarmament in June of this year, it is important that the negotiations on the chemical weapons convention be concluded at the earliest possible date, before we lose the momentum provided by the Gulf crisis. There is very little time until the mid-1992 deadline and I hope the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva will continue its work even while the General Assembly is in session. The position of Japan on the question of missiles was set forth in its appeal at the Tokyo Conference on the Missile Technology Control Regime this March, and it is hoped that all countries will adopt the Regime guidelines.\nThe Gulf crisis demonstrated anew how very important it is that conflicts be resolved peacefully through international cooperative efforts led by the United Nations. At the same time, it made the world aware once again of the importance of United Nations peace-keeping operations to ensure that a cease-fire once established is not breached. In today's changing world, the peace-keeping operations are an increasingly important and indispensable activity for promoting the resolution of regional conflicts, and it is expected that they will be further activated in the months and years ahead. Enhancing their function and authority will require broader participation in terms of personnel from the United Rations membership and a more stable financial base.\nSo far, Japan has sought to buttress the peace-keeping operations by voluntary contributions to start-up costs and by subscriptions to the trust fund for such operations. Further, the Government of Japan has just presented to the National Diet a bill that would put in place new domestic arrangements enabling Japan to strengthen its contribution to efforts for world peace in terms of personnel while continuing to extend financial cooperation.\nThe wave of reform under way in the Soviet Union gives us hope that it may be possible to develop a new cooperative relationship with that country in the context of the new international political and economic order. Japan sincerely welcomes the historic changes taking place in the Soviet Union, and intends to work to develop a new relationship based upon the following principles.\nFirst is the principle of strong support for, and solidarity with, the total thrust of the reforms in Soviet domestic and foreign policy and of enhancing and expanding appropriate and effective assistance.\nThe second is that of dramatically strengthening and enhancing multifaceted cooperation with the republics, especially our neighbour, the Russian Republics. In this connection, Japan very much appreciates the view expressed by the leadership of the Russian Republic that the distinction between victor and vanquished has no place in the creation of the new world order, and hopes to strengthen new cooperative relations along these lines.\nThe third is that of expanding appropriate cooperation so that an open Soviet Union can be accepted as a truly constructive partner in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe fourth is that of actively supporting expanded cooperative relations of the Soviet Union with international economic organisations, including a special association with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, so as to integrate the Soviet Union into the world economy.\nThe fifth and most important is that of concluding, in line with the principle of law and justice, as emphasised by the Russian Republic, a peace treaty between our two countries by way of resolving the territorial issue at the earliest possible time and hence effecting a fundamental development in our bilateral relationship. Japan is confident that such a dramatic improvement in Japanese-Russian and Japanese-Soviet relations can make a creative contribution to the structuring of the new world order that we all desire.\nThere are still a number of unresolved conflicts and disputes in the Asia-Pacific region. As an Asian-Pacific country itself, Japan is pursuing an active foreign policy so as to create an international order for ever free of confrontation and division.\nIn this sense, the fact that South Korea and North Korea have joined the United Nations simultaneously at this session is an event of historic significance, and one we welcome as heralding peace and the relaxation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. I very much hope that South Korea and North Korea will continue to work for peaceful unification through direct dialogue in keeping with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Thus I appreciate the constructive proposal for peaceful unification which resident Roh Tae Hoo made in his statement this morning. For its part, Japan has been engaged in negotiations since the beginning of this year for the normalisation of its relations with North Korea, and intends to continue to negotiate in good faith so as to contribute to peace and stability on the peninsula.\nThere is at long last good cause for optimism that a comprehensive settlement may be achieved in Cambodia. Recognising that the promotion of dialogue among the Cambodian parties themselves is the most important factor for peace in that country, Japan has undertaken a number of diplomatic initiatives, including the hosting of the Tokyo meeting on Cambodia last year. We thus sincerely welcome the recent progress made by the Supreme National Council under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. Japan very much hopes that the Paris Conference on Cambodia will be reconvened at the end of October, that lasting peace will be attained with appropriate United Nations involvement and that vigorous nation-building efforts in accordance with the will of the Cambodian people will begin as soon as possible.\nJapan also welcomes the rapid progress that is being made to bring about domestic reforms in South Africa, including the abolition of the legal foundation of apartheid. We hope that discussions for the drafting of a new constitution will commence soon. Japan is ready to support the efforts of all parties concerned for the establishment of a free and democratic society without racial discrimination in South Africa.\nTurning to the situation in Afghanistan, Japan welcomes efforts to achieve a political settlement, including the Secretary-General's five-point proposal and the agreement by the United States and the Soviet Union to end their arms shipments to combatants there. Japan continues to support the tireless efforts for peace of all the parties concerned.\nMany of the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are beset by increasingly grave economic and social difficulties. It is vitally important for all the world that development be promoted and prosperity achieved in those countries. With the threat of nuclear war having receded and ideological conflict being a thing of the past, this is now the international community's most important responsibility. It is essential that we support those developing countries that are making self-help efforts for economic reconstruction and development in close consultation with international organisations, and it is especially imperative that the necessary financial resources, including resources from the private sector, be made available by the industrialised countries. Japan is working to enhance its official development assistance under its Fourth Medium-Term Target, and it is also steadily implementing its capital recycling programme.\nIn view of the special needs of the least-developed countries, Japan cooperated with the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) to host the Least-Developed Countries Tokyo Forum this May to study ways to deal with their problems. In an effort to widen further the loop of cooperation, Japan is planning to convene in Tokyo in 1993 a summit-level African development conference to address the problems of African countries.\nThe maintenance and strengthening of the free and multilateral trading system is indispensable to world economic development, and the successful conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round is both the most important issue facing the world economy and a priority foreign policy issue for Japan. Japan intends to cooperate with the other countries concerned in making every possible effort to conclude the Uruguay Round by the end of the year.\nAs a prerequisite to sustained prosperity, it is most urgent that we work to resolve the many global environmental issues threatening the very survival of the human race and to create a world more congenial to human life. However, threats to the world environment, global warming, depletion of tropical forests, destruction of the ozone layer and encroaching desertification have grown more serious in recent years. During this International Decade for Natural of Disaster Reduction, which commenced last year, it is essential that we redouble our efforts to prevent and mitigate natural disasters.\nResolving these global environmental issues will require that people everywhere transcend the barriers that separate them and work together.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held next year is an important opportunity for all countries to join together and agree on ways of ensuring a congenial environment for the future. As an industrialised Asian nation, and one that has managed to reconcile the dual demands of development and the environment, Japan hopes to contribute to building a cooperative framework for industrialised and developing countries, and is determined to take active initiatives for the success of this Conference. It is also from this position that we intend to continue to play an important role in the negotiations for the framework convention on climate change.\nHoping to support the upgrading of developing countries' ability to deal with the need for environmental conservation, Japan intends to continue to implement vigorously its development assistance, including the establishment  of the United Nations Environment Programs International Environmental Technology Centre in Japan and its support for the sustainable management of tropical forestry resources through, for example, the International Tropical Timber Organisation. Creating a world in which human values are respected and people everywhere can lead lives of dignity is beyond the capabilities of any single nation and is truly a task for all humankind. As the first step in creating such a world, it is essential that the fundamental human rights of everyone be guaranteed, and that all people be enabled to exercise their God-given abilities. Believing that respect for human rights la a universal value and the foundation of world peace and stability, Japan is making an active effort to have human rights respected and promoted world-wide. We are thus concerned that there are still some countries where these fundamental human rights are not yet respected.\nThe wave of democratisation in Eastern Europe has swelled to a major current of democratisation world-wide and has sparked global reforms. This April the Government of Japan stated that its official development assistance will be extended with special attention to the following considerations: the trends in military expenditures by the recipient country, its efforts to promote democratisation and to introduce a market-oriented economy, and the situation with regard to securing basic human rights and freedoms. In line with this approach, Japan intends through its aid to support and contribute to efforts for democratisation and economic reforms world-wide.\nThe tragedy of an increasing number of refugees and displaced persons generated by regional problems and armed conflicts in many parts of the world is a direct affront to the concept of respect for humanity. It is imperative that the entire world join together in extending relief to these unfortunate people, said to number some 17 million, and Japan intends to continue its vigorous assistance through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international bodies. In this regard, Japan feels it would be appropriate for a working group, to be organised with the participation of international organisations and other interested parties, to study the possibility of a system to forecast new flows of refugees and to issue early warnings.\nThere is an urgent need to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to provide relief assistance in the event of major emergencies. Measures must be taken to strengthen the coordination and cooperation structures among the humanitarian relief agencies under the Secretary-General and also to ensure that the relief activities of these agencies have maximum effect. Believing that it would be useful for all countries and United Nations agencies to form a stand-by network for the provision of whatever personnel and relief goods they can offer, Japan intends to take an active part in such an international endeavour.\nIt is hoped that the United Nations will play a central role in international cooperation for the creation of a new world order. Never before in the nearly half a century the United Nations has been in existence has support for it been so widespread and expectations so high. This is perhaps the first time ever that conditions have been so favourable for achieving the high ideals envisioned by the Organization's founders.\nWe are at a historic watershed, and whether the United Nations will be able to achieve the great things that people everywhere expect of it and to create a better world for the twenty-first century depends upon what uses we make of it and how well we as Member States support and defend it. Indeed, the United Nations is what its Member States make it.\nAt present I would be hard pressed to say that the United Nations is capable of fully and effectively meeting our expectations. We need to create a strong and efficient United Nations able to respond fully to the needs of this new era. It is imperative that all States that value the United Nations work together and with the Secretary-General in strengthening the functions of the Organisation. Japan, for its part, will be unstinting in its cooperation. I should like, in this connection, to remind Member States once again that the \\\"former enemies\\\" clauses in the United Nations Charter are utterly inappropriate historic relics which should be promptly deleted.\nThis session of the General Assembly is a historic one that will consider the new world that is emerging in the wake of the cold war and the Gulf war and the great reforms in the Soviet Union. Recognizing that it has a historic mission to do everything it can for the world order consistent with its position as a nation of peace, Japan is determined to make the maximum effort for the realization of a peaceful, prosperous and humane world for all.\nWe need to give further impetus to efforts of this kind in order to achieve tangible progress. Let us join together to ensure that this forty-sixth session will prove to be truly significant by providing that impetus.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt Is a great honour for me and the entire Rwandese delegation to convey to the President our warm congratulations on his election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His election is recognition by the international community of the outstanding personal qualities and his ability as a seasoned diplomat. It is also, through him, a tribute to his country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has always striven to strengthen ties of friendship and cooperation between all peace-loving and justice-loving countries.\nWe also congratulate the other officers of the General Assembly elected to direct the work of this session. The Rwandan delegation at this session of the General Assembly wishes to assure the President that it stands fully prepared to make its contribution to the success of the Assembly's work. Our appreciation is also addressed to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, who guided the work of the forty-fifth session with wisdom and competence, the results of which were unanimously lauded.\nPermit me also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez do Cuellar, who has for ten years served and directed our Organisation with competence, wisdom and dedication in discharging the extremely burdensome and complex responsibilities conferred upon him. The many different successes scored bear testimony to his exceptional qualities and have redounded to the esteem and credit of our Organisation. The Rwandese Republic will always remember him as a man who devoted himself heart and soul to the cause of peace, justice, solidarity and the well-being of peoples. He may be assured of our profound gratitude.\nI should also like to add my voice to that of those who have already offered the new Members a heartfelt welcome to the family of the United Nations, namely, the two Koreas; the three Baltic Republics: Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia; the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. They may be assured of our sincere felicitations and our encouragement in working for the blossoming of the noble ideals and, more particularly, contributing to the consolidation of much better international relations of solidarity.\nIn keeping with well-established tradition, the annual convening of the General Assembly is intended to provide an opportunity to take stock of a year's activity by the United Nations, with a view, especially, to preparing for the future on the basis of lessons learned, experience gained and results achieved. It also provides a special opportunity for all Member States to set forth, publicly and solemnly, their positions with regard to the problems currently of concern to the international community. It is an opportunity also to voice the hopes they have for the future, hopes the realisation of which will depend on the mobilisation and contribution of all peoples in the context of more active solidarity above and beyond pious hopes and mere declarations of intent.\nIt is against this backdrop and notwithstanding the rather positive turn of events in international political relations that Rwanda continues to be gravely concerned over the international economic situation. That situation hardly gives any grounds for optimism, mindful as we are of the worsening of the structural crisis in the world economy that is broadening the gap between the industrialised and the developing countries.\nBefore putting forth Rwanda's position on the major problems of international politics in terms of political relations and economic issues, the Rwandese delegation would like first of all to draw the attention of all delegations gathered here for the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly to the gravity of the state of war that my country, Rwanda, has been living through ever since 1 October 1990, when it was attacked by armed elements from Uganda.\nIndeed, since 1 October 1990 the assailants - including a number of former Rwandese refugees hired by and serving in Uganda's regular army, the \\\"National Resistance Army\\\" (NRA), and calling itself the Rwandese Patriotic- Front, or FPR-INKOYANYI - invaded Rwanda before being thrown out on 30 October 1990 and since then it has been organising armed attacks against the Rwandese population in areas bordering on Uganda,\nThe first attempt at an explanation advanced by the aggressors to justify the armed invasion of Rwanda was their allegation that the Rwandese Government had refused to agree to the return of Rwandese who had fled their country at the end of the 1950s in connection with the struggle of the Rwandese people against a feudal-monarchical regime and in favour of the establishment of republican institutions in the country.\nIt should be recalled that this phenomenon of Rwandese refugees grew out of the social revolution of 1959, which brought the overthrow of the feudal regime in favour of republican democracy. The supporters of feudal monarchy rejected the new democratic system and preferred exile with their partisans in neighbouring countries, from where they have regularly launched armed attacks against the newly-constituted Republic of Rwanda between the years 1963 and 1968.\nHowever, Rwanda has always sought a definitive solution to the problem of its refugees, one based on national legislation and international conventions to which my country is party. It is in this spirit that voluntary repatriation, at the specific request of individual refugees, has been carried out on a continuing basis.\nMoreover, it is important to stress that the war that has been going on in Rwanda since 1 October 1990 began at a time when our country was at an advanced stage of negotiations with Uganda with a view to a definitive settlement of the problem of the Rwandese refugees living in Uganda. On the basis of the outcome of those negotiations with Uganda, Rwanda had envisaged ways and means of also settling the problem of Rwandese refugees living in other neighbouring countries and elsewhere in the world.\nOnly two months prior to the invasion of Rwanda, the joint Rwanda-Uganda Ministerial Committee - which had been established In 1980 to work out a definitive settlement of the problem of the Rwandese refugees in Uganda - had just held its third meeting in Kigali, from 27 to 30 July 1990, with the participation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organisation of African Unity. On that occasion, the Rwandese and Ugandan Governments had just reached agreement to the effect, that under the auspices of the High Commissioner for Refugees a survey was to be conducted among the refugees themselves to ascertain their wishes concerning the three options proposed to them, namely, voluntary repatriation to Rwanda, a definitive settlement in Uganda with naturalisation, or a third option of their choosing.\nIt is appropriate also to recall that it had been decided that the Rwanda-Uganda Ministerial Committee, working in concert with the High Commissioner for Refugees, was to meet again in January 1991 to finalize and endorse the solutions arrived at on the basis of the outcome of the survey, and that in the meantime a group of refugees was to visit Rwanda to see for themselves the social and political situation in the country and to report their impressions to the other refugees so that the latter could make a fully informed decision on the matter.\nUnfortunately, that visit, which was to have taken place from the end of September to mid-October 1990, was cancelled by one side and instead Uganda began on 1 October 1990 to carry out an armed invasion against Rwanda.\nEver since the onset of the armed conflict thus imposed upon it, Rwanda, aided by friendly countries, in particular countries of our subregion launched a number of political and diplomatic initiatives aimed at restoring peace in the country and in the region. Against this background the summit meetings held at Mwanza in Tanzania and at Gbadolite in Zaire stressed respect for the cease-fire between the belligerents, the opening of a dialogue between the parties to the conflict, and efforts to find a definitive solution to the problem of the Rwandese refugees. \nIt was precisely for the purpose of studying ways and means of finding a definitive solution to the problem of Rwandese refugees that a regional conference was held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on 19 February 1991, bringing together the Heads of State or Government of the region. On that occasion the Government of Rwanda, while very much deploring the fact, that the war that had been imposed on it since 1 October 1990 had brutally cut short the process of finding solutions to resolve definitively the problem of its refugees, once again expressed its conviction that the voluntary repatriation of all Rwandese refugees was a legitimate right and a factor that would promote peace and reconciliation.\nRwanda consequently reaffirmed its readiness to take the necessary steps to facilitate the smooth return of those refugees wishing to return and to ensure their reintegration into the various facets of national life, but in this connection asked for the indispensable support, of the international community.\nIn conformity with the decisions taken at that Dar es Salaam conference, the Organization of African Unity and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are now in the process of working out, in cooperation with the countries concerned, a plan of action for finding a lasting solution to the problem of Rwandese refugees, a plan which will be submitted to a pledging conference to be held at the beginning of next year. The Government of Rwanda, for its part, is in the process of taking specific action to prepare for the return of: Rwandese refugees that opt for repatriation. A law guaranteeing a general amnesty for Rwandese refugees will shortly be adopted. Nevertheless, the state of war under which Rwanda has been living for a year now hat proved that the quest for a definitive solution of the problem of Rwandese refugees was not really what concerned those that had committed the aggression against Rwanda. Indeed, as the Head of State of Rwanda stressed at\nthe twenty-seventh summit meeting of the Organisation of African Unity, held at Abuja last June, the Rwandese Patriotic Front, as soon as it realised that the pretext of the refugee problem advanced to \\\"legitimise\\\" before the world the invasion of Rwanda no longer carried weight with African and international public opinion, changed the direction of the discussion and called the invasion the defence of the ideal of democracy, endeavouring to make people believe that what it was doing was prompted by its determination to establish democracy in Rwanda.\nThe fact is that since January 1989 the Rwandese Government had been proposing that there be a political renewal, and this idea took tangible shape subsequently, notably through the adoption on 10 June 1991 of a new Constitution legitimising political pluralism as well as effectively establishing political parties, which are already operating and irreversibly committed to strengthening the democratic process.\nIn view of the fact that virtually all the pretexts put forward for launching the war cannot be justified, it is difficult to understand the rationale that is prompting those who committed the aggression against Rwanda to continue the hostilities, to reject the cease-fire recommended by the various summit meetings of Heads of State hold at the subregional level and to refuse to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue under the auspices of the mediator accepted by both parties to the conflict.\nRwanda, profoundly convinced that the ending of hostilities is the essential condition for the settlement of this conflict, which has now lasted for a year, has never ruled out political negotiations with the aggressors. However, it has always stressed that such negotiations are possible only if the guns are silenced and the cease-fire agreement signed between the belligerents on 29 March 1901 is complied with.\nIt is therefore the obstinate position taken by the Rwandese Patriotic Front in continuing hostilities that has held up progress towards dialogue. The Head of State of Rwanda made clear Uganda's share of responsibility in this regard when at the last summit meeting of the Organisation of African Unity, held at Abuja - after having demonstrated that those attacking Rwanda had no bases within Rwanda itself but were operating from Uganda, where they were being sheltered and were receiving all the necessary logistical support - he asked the Organisation of African Unity to enjoin Uganda to disarm the aggressors on its territory.\nA positive circumstance to be noted is that the summit meeting of Heads of State held in Gbado-Lite, Zaire, on 7 September 1991, once again stressed the need to abide by an immediate and complete cease-fire and recommended that the parties to the conflict enter quickly into a dialogue. The first round of that dialogue was held from 15 to 17 September 1991 in Gbado-Lite, under the auspices of the mediator, the Head of State of Zaire, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko.\nBut we have found, to our great regret, that the Rwandese Patriotic Front, counting on the support of the Ugandan Army in continuing the war, has been engaging in stalling manoeuvres to boycott that dialogue and prevent it from moving forward. Surely it is through dialogue that positions can be reconciled. The Government of Rwanda, for its part, is profoundly committed to such dialogue and remains ready to resume it without delay and without preconditions. It is the strong desire of the Rwandese Government that this dialogue swiftly bring about results conducive to ending the conflict, thus creating a propitious climate of peace and security within Rwanda as well as throughout the region, and at the same time facilitating the return to Rwanda of those refugees wishing to return. Rwanda is counting very much on the support of the international community, of all the countries Members of the United Nations represented at this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, as we seek to make that hope a reality.\nThe safeguarding of international peace and security and the constant building of ties of friendship and cooperation among nations remain the basic objectives of our actions as mankind continues its long march towards the realization of Its most profound aspiration - that is, the flourishing of international concord, of freedom and of the progress of peoples everywhere.\nRwanda wishes once again to affirm its solemn commitment to the triumph of the cause of peace and it pays a profound tribute to the United Nations for the invaluable successes it has achieved since its inception. We take this opportunity to express our hopes for a further strengthening of the bonds of fraternity and solidarity among peoples, so that we can bring to an end the crisis persisting in the world, particularly in the southern hemisphere, including Africa, a crisis that is both economic and political.\nNotwithstanding the generally successful record and tireless efforts of the United Nations since the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the international community today is still confronting certain conflicts which cast a pall over the international political scene. The world is still torn apart by bloody tensions and deadly conflicts arising out of anachronistic situations of intolerance, colonization, oppression and racism. Naked violence holds sway wherever the sovereignty of peoples and the integrity of States are flouted, wherever the dignity and the fundamental rights of people are disregarded or trampled underfoot.\nAs to the major issue of fundamental human rights and the dignity of the human person, the Government of Rwanda welcomes the step taken since the liberation of Mr. Nelson Mandela, President of the African National Congress of South Africa (AHC), on 11 February 1990, in the process set in motion in South Africa with a view to eliminating the system of apartheid.\nThe removal, officially, of that system on 30 June 1991, after the three juridical pillars of apartheid had been eliminated - namely, the Land Acts, the Group Areas Act and the Population Regulation Act, as wall as the agreement reached on 1 July 1991 between the South African Government and the ANC concerning the freeing of political prisoners - opened a new chapter in interracial relations in South Africa.\nAnd yet, we deplore the fact that acts of violence and massacres still persist, especially in the black townships, and that the South African Government, which is responsible for maintaining law and order, has not managed to prevent them. We also denounce the secret financing of such acts by the South African Government.\nThus, while we note with satisfaction certain positive changes in South Africa, the Government of Rwanda believes that a great deal still remains to be done in the process of dismantling apartheid. It lauds the efforts made by the President of South Africa, Mr. De Klerk, and the President of the ANC, Mr. Nelson Mandela, and encourages the South African Government to pursue negotiations with the representatives of the other South African racial communities, including the ANC, to speed the day of the actual eradication of apartheid, once and for all, in that part of our continent.\nAs to Angola, my Government welcomes the Peace Agreement signed in Lisbon on 31 May 1991 between the Government of Angola and UNITA. This agreement constitutes a major step towards restore peace, security and stability to Angola. The international community is called upon to support the efforts that are being made, at the bilateral and multilateral levels, to give tangible expression to the goals embodied in that agreement in the interests of international peace and security.\nAs to Namibia, it is our view that the international community must support the negotiations set in motion between Namibia and South Africa to reintegrate Walvis Bay and the offshore islands, into Namibia, in keeping with Security Council resolution 432 (1978).\nThe Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, meeting at Abuja, Nigeria, from 4 to 6 June 1991, were of the opinion that the problem of Walvis Bay and of the offshore Namibian islands was not a border dispute but rather an issue involving decolonization, an issue which must be resolved fairly and definitively as quickly as possible.\nRwanda also reaffirms its support for the Mozambican people and is pleased at the efforts made by the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO to find a peaceful settlement of the conflict, which has been rending that country asunder for several years now.\nNotwithstanding the significant progress made at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the problem of Western Sahara still remains a concern for the international community.\nIn fact, at the end of April 1991, the Security Council adopted an overall plan which took effect on 17 May 1991, entrusting the United Nations with the responsibility for organizing and monitoring a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara next year to determine whether the people want to be independent, as POLISARIO wishes, or whether they prefer to become integrated into Morocco. Rwanda therefore welcomes the positive turn of events there and encourages the parties concerned fully to cooperate with the United Nations in finding a definitive solution to that conflict.\nElsewhere in Africa, the Government of Rwanda hopes for an end to the civil war in Ethiopia and Somalia and encourages the peoples and governments of those countries to spare no efforts to ensure peace, justice and security in that part of Africa.\nAs to the civil war in Liberia, Rwanda remains convinced that only through dialogue can peace be restored in that country, together with security in the region. Hence we would very much like to see the parties to the conflict, supported by the countries in the region, continue the consultations with a view to restoring peace and unity to the Liberian people.\nRwanda firmly believes in the value of dialogue in finding a peaceful settlement to disputes and in the principle of non-resort to force, and in consonance with international ethics and modern international law, it strongly condemns terrorism and aggression.\nIn international forums Rwanda has invariably voiced its dedication and commitment to pea and political dialogue and has always striven to translate them into action on the subregional, regional and international levels. Thus, like other countries that espouse peace and freedom, we heaved a sigh of relief when the cease-fire agreement was signed in the Gulf region on 28 February 1991 after Kuwait had been liberated by the anti-Iraqi Coalition forces created under United Nations auspices to free Kuwait from the invasion and Iraqi occupation that had gone on since 2 August 1990.\nAs it did throughout the Gulf crisis, Rwanda supports the measures and efforts undertaken by the international community under the aegis of the United Nations to restore law, justice, peace and security in that part of the globe.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be very alarming and the Israeli-Arab conflict - a conflict which is being exacerbated by the Palestinian problem - continues to give rise to acute disquiet in the international community which is, after all, agreed that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution be found to this problem.\nThus the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session once again invited the Security Council to examine the steps necessary for the convening of an International peace conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nThe Rwandan Government welcomes the results that have already been achieved, through the efforts of the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr. James Baker, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as those of the countries of the region, to convince the parties concerned, including Israel and the PLO, of the need to hold an international peace conference on the Middle East to put an end to this conflict, which has been with us since 1947.\nThe international community is thus duty-bound to support all efforts exerted at the bilateral and international levels to facilitate the holding and success of this conference, which is scheduled to be held in October 1991.\nWith respect to the situation in Cambodia, we express our satisfaction at, and our total support for the cease-fire agreement signed on 25 June 1991 between the Cambodian Government and the anti-government Cambodian coalition, as well as the results of the election of 18 July 1991, which brought Prince Norodom Sihanouk to the presidency of the Supreme National Council, the provisional body which is to hold power in Phnon Penh starting this coming November until the holding of general elections to be organised and supervised by the United Nations. Rwanda supports the efforts of the United Nations and the other concerned parties to resolve this conflict once and for all to the benefit of international peace and security.\nRwanda also continues to encourage all efforts aimed at the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation and hopes that the admission of the two Koreas States to the great family of the United Nations will contribute to making a reality of that legitimate aspiration of the Korean people.\nElsewhere in the world, we note with optimism and support the noble initiatives for dialogue and negotiations for peace and reconciliation already under way in Latin America, notably within the framework of the Contadora Group. We believe that the outcome of the Mexico Summit is a significant contribution towards consolidating peace and security in the region.\nThe international economy is still in crisis - a crisis which for the third-world countries increasingly poses a threat to their very survival and runs the risk of negating the laborious efforts at development that have already been undertaken. The crisis is essentially structural in nature because it involves machinery which currently governs international economic relations, with the increasingly negative impact Inherent in the instability of financial markets, the continued deterioration in the terms of trade, the stagnation in commodity markets, and indebtedness.\nThe African continent is still experiencing tragic problems of underdevelopment) economic projects for the majority of countries in the least developed category are grim, especially for those countries, like Rwanda, which are faced with various structural handicaps that are exacerbated by the current economic situation. These are the most disadvantaged countries of the world) they are witnessing a worsening of the living conditions of their peoples, unable to do anything about the scourges of poverty, hunger, malnutrition and ignorance.\nRwanda, one of the very seriously affected victims of the persistent international economic crisis, deplores this situation and once again appeals to the international community to display greater solidarity and more effective understanding, with a view to overcoming the constraints and development problems.\nThe problem of indebtedness is of acute concern to the developing countries, particularly the least developed among them. As so rightly recalled by the Summit Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Organisation of African Unity held in Abuja from 4 to 6 June 1991, the unprecedented drop in prices for the commodities sold by African countries which has led to worsening terms of trade, the adoption of increasingly protectionist measures and restrictive trade practices on the markets of the industrialized countries aimed against exports from Africa - those are some of the chief external causes that have led to our continent's indebtedness.\nRwanda regrets that the need to convene an international conference on Africa's external debt does not yet enjoy consensus between the industrialized countries and the developing countries, notably within the United Nations,\nwhere, none the less, a broad consensus is emerging on the desirability of developing international economic cooperation on the external debt. While we welcome the decision adopted at the Summit Conference of the seven major industrialised countries held in London on 18 July 1991 to cancel between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of the official debt incurred by the least developed countries, we none the less continue to feel that a conference on Africa's external debt should be convened; such a conference could provide an appropriate framework in the search for an urgent solution to this serious problem that is mortgaging Africa's economic development.\nIn this connection, we hail Japan's initiative to host the International Conference on Africa's Development, scheduled for 1993, with the participation of the African Heads of State. The Republic of Rwanda pays a ringing tribute to the people and the Government of Japan for this historic initiative of great benefit to the African continent.\nWith respect to the international trade situation, Rwanda continues to believe that, in order for the international trade system to be acceptable, it must provide for the elimination of all kinds of trade barriers and for the integration in the system of small countries that are now marginalised, including African countries. Also, in order for the system to be viable, it must be profitable to all trade partners.\nTherefore, it is important for all participants in the Uruguay Round negotiations to pay special attention to the problems and concerns of the African countries. We stress that all the parties to the negotiations should take part on an equal footing so that the negotiations' outcome will be fair and acceptable to all. Rwanda welcomes the establishment by the Summit Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Organisation of African Unity, held in Abuja from 4 to 6 June 1991, of the African Economic Community, one of whose goals is to promote Africa's economic, social and cultural development and the integration of its economies, with a view to enhancing economic self-sufficiency and promoting endogenous and self-sustaining development.\nWe call upon the international community, and especially the most industrialised countries and the international financial institutions, to support this initiative in every way and to help the nascent African Economic Community attain its noble goals.\nWe call for just and appropriate measures to support the effort at revitalization undertaken by our countries at considerable sacrifice, and for better integrated and more adaptable solutions to be developed with the full cooperation of all parties, in order to ensure that mankind will enjoy a future of fairness, balance and harmony.\nIt is in this context that Rwanda wishes once again from this rostrum to express its sincere thanks to all countries and international organizations which, on a bilateral basis or at the multilateral level, are providing the additional support it needs for its development and, in particular, for its structural adjustment programme, which has been in the process of implementation since November last year.\nEcological problems are now of world concern. But there are still differences of view with respect to the causes and responsibilities linked to the deterioration and the protection of the environment, as well as with respect to the measures to be taken in this field. Once again Africa finds itself the victim; there is drought, desertification, floods and devastation the result of insect infestations. My country, Rwanda, ascribes particular importance to preserving its natural patrimony and has made the protection of the environment one of the major priorities of its food self-sufficiency policy.\nRwanda is glad that the international community la tackling the problem of the environment and is aware of the urgent need to mobilise all resources necessary to provide solutions that will guarantee the survival of our planet. There are grounds for hope that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development scheduled for Brazil In June 1992, the preparatory work for which is continuing, will reach concerted and appropriate solutions to preserve a sound and viable environment for mankind. Rwanda is participating in this work and is making its modest contribution to ensuring its success.\nThe forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly is being held in a climate of particularly favourable international relations. Rwanda welcomes the fact that the cold war, which after the Second World War divided the world into two antagonistic blocs and maintained the division of Europe, has once and for all ended thanks to the policy of perestroika and of glasnost of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. This led to the changes in Eastern Europe, especially the peaceful reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990.\nWe welcome the general relaxation of tensions in the world-wide political climate, which has made possible, indeed facilitated, a solution to many different local and regional conflicts across Africa, Asia and Latin America. The winds of freedom and democracy which blew across Eastern Europe, and the effects of which were quickly felt in a variety of other places around the world, especially in Africa, are a major factor in the political changes now under way.\nRwanda takes note of and appreciates the support which Western countries are giving to this democratic upsurge. It is of the view, however, that, while supporting the democratic processes thus set in train, the Western countries should do nil they can to see to it that the economic development of the countries concerned becomes the strongest pillar of that democracy because, and this must be emphasised, it is an illusion to seek to build a around democracy without promoting the socio-economic development of peoples.\nMy country which, in June 1991, began to establish a political system based upon a multiparty approach, seizes this opportunity to reaffirm its unbroken faith in and commitment to respect for human dignity and other values universally recognised as human rights. He also reaffirm our faith in a future marked by a better world, a world of peace and solidarity, a world from which war and all manner of violence, terrorism and discrimination are banished for ever, a world freed once and for all of the vestiges of colonialism, racism and injustice, a world marked by understanding, dialogue and cooperation.\nWe strongly urge the United States and the Soviet Union to preserve the gains of dialogue joined in the realm of disarmament, to the great relief of mankind, and we welcome the signing of the strategic arms reduction Treaty which took place on 31 July 1991 between the United States and the Soviet Union on the occasion of the Moscow summit. He also welcome the conclusion of the treaty on conventional disarmament between the East and West signed on 19 November 1990 in Paris by the Heads of State and Government of the 35 countries on the occasion of the summit meeting from 19 to 21 November of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. On the same occasion they signed a joint declaration solemnly putting an end to the cold war and affirming that they were no longer adversaries but rather had decided to establish new relations of friendship and partnership.\nWe hail especially the declaration taken by the United States and the Soviet Union in favour of a unilateral reduction in their nuclear arsenals. We welcome in advance the idea that the other major nuclear Powers will certainly follow suit. Rwanda deeply believes in the United Nations and recognises its indispensable role in maintaining peace, security and justice in the struggle to bring well-being to peoples the world over. We express our sincere gratitude to the agencies throughout the United Nations system which are contributing to the social and economic development of mankind.\nWe support the establishment of a new and more fruitful North/South cooperation with a view to promoting more equitable economic and political ties between States. Such cooperation will serve the general interests of international peace and security and is likely to promote the economic recovery of all countries but especially the developing countries and among them the least developed.\nIn this spirit Rwanda will actively participate in the work of this forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly and will constantly strive to make its contribution to the fulfilment of the noble objectives of the Charter. These include the attainment of a new international economic order for peoples the world over, within the context of equality, complementarity, understanding and solidarity, and a greater measure of peace, justice and well-being for people everywhere on Earth.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe political physiognomy of the world has been profoundly altered within recent tines. The cold-war era, which generated awesome contending forces and so poignantly shaped and influenced international relations for far too long, is virtually at an end. Gone are the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. The potential for nuclear conflict and its destructive consequences has been reduced, as have many other foreboding features of East-West confrontation. In their place have emerged a new trait, of independence and the outline of a new world order, which, albeit still ill-defined, can be discerned by the eyes of faith and hope.\nWe have therefore entered into a new and promising era of global relationships. Yet the image of the world is still clouded. Principles and purposes which underpin the Charter of this Organization too often continue to be observed In the breach. International disputes have not always been nettled by peaceful means, as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and its aftermath confirm. Nor has the international cooperation for the solution of problems of on economic character boon as forthcoming as anticipated.\nHope for the future and concern for it consequently stand juxtaposed. Even as the potential for nuclear conflict has been reduced, recourse to the use of force to settle international and bilateral conflicts remains a serious threat to the preservation of global peace and security. Even as regional cooperation and integration becomes a global process involving the creation of large and powerful economic trading blocs, certain States, driven by forces more powerful and more basin than nationalism, are undergoing centrifugal experiences which presage their fragmentation. \nThe centrifugal forces that have arisen from the catharsis in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and elsewhere represent a challenge to the traditional concepts of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. They raise the ineluctable question as to whether the world will become a unitary constellation as we have long anticipated, or eventually disintegrate into a motley collection of fissiparous States. At the same time we cannot overlook the fact that the collapse of the colonial empires and the ongoing transformations in the Soviet Union have now brought the membership of this Organization closer to universality. There is also an increasing surge towards democracy, the promotion of human rights within all States and the demand to be governed by consent rather than by force. Yet a reluctance persists on the part of some of these States to extend in full the principles of democracy and freedom to the relations between States and in intergovernmental organizations. While they may not always be paradoxical, global trends remain complex. While the world moves towards unipolarity in political terms, economics has established its salience over politics and the international economic environment has become more multipolar in character. Yet the trend towards a unipolar political world in effect has narrowed the options for models of development. As a consequence, more widespread agreement now exists on the critical elements for promoting beneficial and sustained development. In the face of these complexities, it is incumbent upon us to analyse the current trends and, to the extent possible, attempt to direct their course. This should be a primary task of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under the able guidance of Ambassador Shihabi, we will not fail to find the way forward. \nWe are for this reason eminently pleased by the election of Ambassador Shihabi to the presidency of the forty-sixth session. This distinction conferred upon him is a recognition not only of his own diplomatic skills, but also of the prestige of his native Saudi Arabia. I am happy to note that our two countries enjoy excellent relations through long established cultural and religious ties. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor in office. His Excellency Mr. Guido De Marco, the distinguished Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, for his exemplary conduct of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. He has been a fervent advocate of the revitalisation of the United Nations to serve the growing needs of its membership. It is a plea that we must certainly heed if we are to make this Organisation adequate and responsive to the altered circumstances of today.\nA similar call has been made in his recent report to the Assembly by our much respected Secretary-General on the basis of his long years of experience as the world body's Chief Executive. And new demands there certainly are, since with the passage of time, the international agenda has increasingly expanded. As he demits office, the Secretary-General deserves our profound gratitude for having guided our Organisation through a most challenging decade. We can pay him no better tribute, I feel, than to build upon his accomplishments and further strengthen the United Nations.\nI have adverted to the principle of universality upon which this Organization was founded. It remains for me therefore to welcome not only the three Baltic States, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania, which have regained their independence, but also the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which have elected to accede to membership of the United Nations. I am convinced that these seven States will provide fresh dynamism to the Organization and contribute fully to its work.\nIt was exactly 25 years ago, on 20 September 1966,  that Guyana became a Member of this Organization. Twenty-five years ago we dedicated ourselves to democracy, its processes and its ideals. He resolved to preserve our independence, to develop our resources with our energies and the assistance of friends. Our aspirations today are no different from what they were then. However, we know that we live in a world of stark realities and we are sure that, given an opportunity to be heard, we can continue to contribute to the establishment of a just and peaceful world.\nIt took Guyana every moment of those 25 years to successfully assert its right to participate fully in regional organizations and arrangements within its hemisphere. For it was in January of this year that Guyana was admitted as a member to the Organization of American States. The road that we travelled was long. And the journey would probably not have been at an end but for the fact that our sister countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) were persistent with their call to the organization to extend the universality of its membership to Guyana and its travelling companion, Belize. Other member States of the organization also distinguished themselves in the wake of the CARICOM call. Guyana has expressed its appreciation to all of the member States for receiving it into the organization that is the bosom of the hemispheric family.\nIt is a source of great satisfaction to Guyana that it is marking its twenty-fifth anniversary as a Member of the United Nations at a time when the character of the global political environment is decidedly more welcome than any during our participation in the Organization. This is due to the new detente that underpins the relations between Moscow and Washington. A world order that was tenuously based on terror and mutually assured destruction is progressively giving way to a sew order resting on secure foundations of confidence and predictability. I am equally glad therefore that there is now the promise of far-reaching agreement on further measures in the current negotiations on arms reduction. Is this regard, Guyana welcomes the recent proposals put forward by President Bush. Now that those proposals have been reciprocated by President Gorbachev, the world appears to be drawing closer to the day when nuclear weapons no longer form part of the armoury either of defence or of offense.\nPositive action in the field of disarmament can have beneficial effects other than improving the overall security condition. The link between disarmament and development, which appears so obvious to so many States, can hopefully now receive universal and unqualified acknowledgement, and agreement can be reached on concrete steps to make it a reality.\nWhile the positive developments in the area of arms reduction must be welcomed, it is necessary to be alert to the heightened threat to security that other conditions pose. The most pervasive are the parlous economic and social circumstances of large sections of national populations. The increasing pauperization of peoples the world over should be a matter of global concern. So too must be those situations of conflict and turbulence which, in the circumstances of yesteryear, seemed intractable and unyielding to solutions. I am referring here to the Middle East, South Africa, Central America, Western Sahara, Cambodia and the Korean peninsula, among others. The prospects in relation to many of them appear less foreboding now.\nThis is particularly so in Central America, where the remaining sparks of violence in El Salvador and elsewhere are quietly being extinguished. The restoration of peace in Nicaragua and the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between Belize and Guatemala serve to diminish tension in the area and enhance the prospects for regional co-operation. In Cambodia we note the establishment of the representative Supreme National Council, which has begun the process of national reconciliation. In a still divided Cyprus, options for the resolution of the conflict must be thoroughly explored in order to safeguard the welfare and territorial integrity of that country. In Western Sahara there is still hope that a cessation of hostilities will permit the emplacement of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and allow the United Nations to promote a settlement between the belligerents.\nObstacles to some solutions in other countries and regions, however, still remain, especially where these difficulties inhere in deeply entrenched feelings ranging from notions of racial superiority to the primordial need for territorial space, including beliefs stemming from the expression of national dignity, culture and religion. In South Africa the iniquitous apartheid system is yet to yield fully to diplomatic efforts. As a member of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Committee on Southern Africa, Guyana holds the view that pressure through the appropriate forms of sanctions should be maintained on the South African Government so that it completes and adheres to a programme that will make the process for the dismantling of apartheid irreversible. The De Klerk Government must also conduct meaningful negotiations with the authentic representatives of the majority for the construction of a democratic South Africa.\nThe Middle East imbroglio has been further complicated by the Gulf war. But this very development makes more valid the need for an international conference in which all parties, including the Palestinians, are involved. Current initiatives to convene a regional peace conference are an encouraging step in this direction.\nIn this hemisphere, the frigidity of the cold war lingers on in the anomalous hostility between the United States and Cuba. To truly guarantee world peace, it is imperative that detente be generalized. It is now time to bury antagonisms which are the relics of another era. As a friend of both the United States and Cuba, Guyana urges those two States to come together in a new spirit of friendship and cooperation to bring full harmony to international relations.\nHe realize of course that the ending of East/West rivalries is not the panacea for all conflict situations. Clearly there are problems that have their origins in circumstances other than the cold war. Among the most combustible causes are territorial controversies, national aggrandisement, and old ethnic hatreds. In the instant case of Haiti whose democratically elected government has been overthrown by a military coup, it is the refusal of a minority to accept the popular will of the majority. Such acts of violence are thus a challenge to the role of this Organization under its Charter for the preservation of international peace and security.\nIn many of the conflict situations to which I have adverted, the United Nations has played a significant part in the search for peaceful solutions as the recent Ministerial Meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned countries in Accra acknowledged. The Gulf war provided an opportunity for the Organization to demonstrate its capacity to be effective when Member States stand by their commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter. Yet there is a danger in the new political dispensation. It arises from the temptation to bend the international interest either to the national purpose of a single State or to that of a concert of pre-selected Powers. That temptation should be avoided.\nThere is a widespread feeling that while the Charter makes clear provisions for the maintenance of peace and security these could be utilised more fully. The experience of the Gulf war has prompted a fresh look at the Security Council, the organ primarily concerned with threats to peace. While demonstrably active and influential, the Council can and must do more to discharge the important role assigned to it. In this regard, it should seek to develop machinery that is more capable not only of enforcing its decisions and resolutions but also of preventing the eruption of conflict. Equally important to its effectiveness is complete confidence in its modus operandi. The Council must therefore appear at all times to be democratic and transparent in the conduct of its business. To achieve this, some reform of its operation could be contemplated.\nIn the new environment of hope for mutually beneficial international cooperation, the question of economic security looms large. Last year, this Assembly adopted two constructive documents. The first, the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation, in particular the revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development of Developing Countries, was agreed upon in special session. The second, the International Development Strategy, recorded our consensus during the regular session. It is a moot question as to whether the provisions of these documents are being implemented with seriousness or at all. We must not only agree on what to do but we must also do it. \nMeanwhile, groups of nations are organising themselves regionally to promote their common economic interests. This is a logical outgrowth of the global trends in the world economy. Guyana, tooth as a member of the Caribbean Community and of other major regional economic groupings such as the Latin American Economic System within the Latin American and Caribbean region, is an active participant, in the process of regional cooperation and integration. In the wider hemispheric context, the President of the United States launched a bold end imaginative scheme, the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. This initiative admits for the first time in the history of the economic relations between the United States and Latin America and the Caribbean of negotiations on some of its elements, a situation that existed for the Caribbean Community countries in their relations with Canada, and for some African, Pacific and Caribbean countries In their relations with the European Community.\nThis initiative has been widely welcomed in the region. Based on mutual need, its progressive implementation through mature consultations can redound to the benefit of the countries of the hemisphere to which it applies.\nDespite the advantages afforded by regional economic and trading groups, we need to ensure that those small, States within them, no less than those that are outside for whatever reason, are not marginalized. To avert this possibility, good governance, coupled with the principles of equity and fair play, must facilitate the creation of a level playing-field for all countries.\nNone the less, it should he observed that economic activity in most developing countries, with few exceptions, has slowed over the last year. With continued recession, particularly in Latin America and Africa, the decline has reached the point where the prospects of recovery are becoming \nremote. Poverty has become endemic, as a plague of social ills overwhelms most populations.\nWe have witnessed the efforts of the African countries to pull their economies out of the morass of stagnation and despair. It is our belief that the critical economic situation in Africa, and throughout the developing world, can be alleviated and tremendously helped by better terms of trade, not just more aid. In this regard, we welcome the Japanese initiative for a summit with African countries to discuss the critical situation in Africa.\nFortunately, there is some recognition of the severe limitations which distressed economies impose on the national capacity to honour debt obligations. There is also grudging recognition that an amelioration of the difficulties in the form of debt rescheduling and debt reduction is still not effective enough to break the impasse, even when coupled with restructuring and reform of national economies under the guidance of the major international lending institutions.\nDeveloping countries have made an eloquent case in favour of major debt cancellations, which have been already granted on a bilateral basis to some countries and which appear to be an imperative for these nations if they are to jump-start their economies to bring them into the mainstream of international economic activity.\nInternational trade, in particular agricultural trade, reflects a marked depression in prices for primary commodities, which, despite efforts at diversification, remain the only anchor for many developing countries' economies. Protectionism, regrettably, still holds sway in some quarters, denying free access to our products. As a member of the Caribbean Community, we welcome the initiative of some countries, notably Canada, the European Community, the United States and Venezuela, to open up their markets to our region. We hope that the current Uruguay Round will eventually, notwithstanding its halting progress, evince extensive agreement leading to a rapid liberalization of world trade.\nOn the question of development financing, it is of particular concern to us that the developing countries must now compete with the \\\"economies in transition\\\" - a euphemistic reference to the States of Eastern and Central Europe. As these States fulfil their desire to be fully integrated into the world economy, it will clearly be necessary for the international community to respond appropriately to their needs in terms of capital, technology and organization.\nIt should be forcefully recalled, however, that other economies are also in transition: those of the developing countries. There is an essential difference, however. It is that the economies of Eastern and Central Europe are in transition from a command economy to one that is market-oriented. On\nthe other hand, the developing countries are already Integrated Into the world economy, but on unequal terms. The urgent transition that most of them require is from underdevelopment, spawned by colonialism, and attendant poverty to the primary stage of the satisfaction of basic needs at minimum levels. The response of the international community to those two nets of needs should, therefore, not compromise the requirements of either group of countries. Accordingly, we echo the Secretary General's call for an international conference on development financing to address these crucial issues.\nA relatively recent addition to the global concern with development is the environment. The rapid degradation of the planet on which we live and the dire consequences it has for our future have arrested the attention of the international community. Fortunately, there is a broad consensus on the urgent need for concerted action to cope with the dangers which unrestrained national activities in this field can create.\nUnder the authorization of this Assembly, preparations are well under way for the World Conference on Environment and Development, to be held next, year in June in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is, I believe, the most ambitious enterprise attempted in international cooperation. As Guyana sees it, the Conference should seek to forge, through negotiations and mutual concessions, a compact which, it is hoped, will record international consensus on a complex and interlocking series of issues and be truly reflective of the interdependent character of our world. It is therefore critical to developing countries that the imperatives of development be not lost, in the technical debate on the environment.\nFrom Guyana's standpoint, certain clear requirements should be universally embraced if a successful outcome to negotiations is to\nmaterialize. These Include the provision to developing countries of new and additional resources, access to environmentally sound technology at no cost, or one that is low, and also institutional strengthening and capacity building, nationally and regionally. More specifically, Guyana would urge that the countries that are endowed with biodiversity benefit adequately from its possession and Its use and that the relationship between biodiversity and biotechnology be comprehensively developed. As a low lying coastal State, and as an Amazonian country rich in biodiversity, Guyana is playing a full part In the noble international endeavour to provide environmental security.\nAnother facet of the multidimensional problem of development is the international traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The great strides that have been made in fighting this scourge must be maintained. I am glad to recognize that there is now greater cooperation between States and more involvement, of non-governmental agencies in the effort to reduce demand and curtail supply. The United Nations and its relevant agencies are being increasingly effective in playing a constructive role. Our collaborative efforts must continue.\nAt this conjuncture and in the context of the profound changes of which I spoke earlier, what is required is structural adjustment that is all encompassing and thorough-going. There has to be structural adjustment in perception; structural adjustment in national economic organization; and structural adjustment in international relations, investing them pervasively with the attributes and practices of democratic governance, between States and within international organizations. It will not happen at one fell swoop. A start has been made, but unless the adjustment, is fully embraced we can face the frightening prospect, of now hegemonies and the marginalization of several actors on the international stage.\nGuyana has been alive to those imperatives. Four years ago we embarked up in the reconstruction of our economy. The programme is being successfully implemented with the cooperation of the international Institutions and the bilateral assistance of friendly States constituting a support group. Me have encouraged the full participation of the private sector In the recovery programme. He have opened our markets to trade and investment in an effort to Integrate our economy fully at the global level. But the adjustment process has been arduous and painful, especially for the vulnerable sectors of the population. In general, however, our ability to adhere to the programme attests to cohesion within the society and the recognition that, there is no viable alternative.\nCentral to this structural adjustment programme is our belief that our country's stability depends crucially on the maintenance and continued enlargement of conditions of freedom in every sphere of national life. This belief has found expression in a series of reforms that would place national elections, which will be held before the end of this year, and other aspects of the democratic process beyond credible challenge. As my President recently declared,\n\\\"If I were to be asked to summarize the grand objective towards which our current nation-building enterprise is directed I would say: to complete as rapidly as possible the evolution of Guyana as a country of free people, practising free enterprise in an open society.\\\" We are unequivocally committed to the consolidation of a democratic order and to the full development; of the human potential.\nOur Organization formed part of a new world order in the wake of the Second World War. In looking back at the order of 1945, we find there are today more voices representing wider and more varied interests. These additional voices seek to influence the orientation of the new order. Their purpose is to ensure that it operates in the interest of the world's people and that the results are symmetric.\nMany occasions will arise for all Members of this Organization to demonstrate by their actions their will to create a democratic new world order. In Guyana's view, the current discussions and negotiations on the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment aid Development provide a unique opportunity for the demonstration o\u00a3 that will and purpose. He can, if we are alive to the urgency of the situation and to the requirements of the time, by the results we achieve at that Conference set a blueprint for international cooperation in the future. Here we to fail, the new order would remain in a state of prolonged gestation and the promise of partnership would be postponed. Worse, the negative elements of the present malformed order would remain to haunt us with grave potential consequences. The goal, therefore, is to show that a global partnership is possible. Indeed it is an imperative. Let us resolve to proceed apace to build a truly effective global partnership.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the great Libyan Arab People's Jamahiriya, I wish to extend to Ambassador Shihabi my most sincere congratulations upon his election as President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his wisdom, experience and eminent personal qualities will enable us to achieve optimum results.\nI should also like to express the appreciation and satisfaction of my delegation to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the friendly Republic of Malta, who demonstrated consummate skill in conducting the deliberations of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly in a manner worthy of high esteem and commendation.\nMy delegation should also like to express its appreciation and pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has exerted sincere efforts in enhancing and promoting the role of the United Nations.\nMoreover, we welcome the admission of the Republic of Korea and of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We are confident that their admission to the United Nations will help to fulfil the aspirations of the Korean people to reunify the Korean peninsula. We should also like to welcome the admission of the three Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - as well as that of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.\nThe United Nations has made significant contributions in international cooperation in various forms. It has played an important role in decolonization during the past four decades. The international community at present is more than ever in dire need of enhancing the role of the world Organization. We believe that this can be achieved only through serious collective action that is free from self-interest. This requires, first and foremost, a sincere political will on the part of member countries and unconditional moral, material and political support to the United Nations. The Organisation would thus be able to rise to the level of the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world as envisaged in the Preamble of the Charter and enshrined in the lofty and noble principles of the United Nations.\nThis also makes it necessary for the international community to reconsider the veto privilege and to move from the stage of making demands to taking concrete action upon such a recommendation. It is clear that there is no longer any justification for retaining the veto privilege which has continued to be a major obstacle to the proper discharge by the Security Council of its principal task, namely the preservation of international peace and security and the cause of the consequent paralysis of the United Nations effectiveness. Furthermore, the veto privilege has caused untold harm to the peoples of the poor countries as it has been exploited in entrenching concepts that run counter to international legality.\nWe call for an immediate start on serious efforts to enhance the role of the Organization. We believe there is an urgent need to reconsider some of the provisions of the Charter which are no longer compatible with the changing international circumstances. My country, which has the honour of having taken the initiative of calling for the reconsideration of the veto privilege, shall maintain its principled and steadfast stand on this matter, as we are convinced that this is the proper way to ensure that a strong and effective United Nations develops in such a way that it becomes an effective deterrent to those who espouse the policies of force, who practise injustice and oppression, aggression and organized terrorism and economic and scientific blockade against the poor developing nations.\nMy country calls for the enhancement of the role of the United Nations General Assembly, so that the Security Council may become an organ that expresses the will of the peoples of the United Nations to preserve international peace and security and the principles of respect for sovereignty, and not a council for the security of certain States. \nMy country has suffered the scourges of colonialism in the past and recently. At the beginning of the century, we were the victims of an abhorrent fascist invasion, occupation and settlement, under which we suffered all forms of oppression, genocide and depopulation. During the Second World War, Libya's territory was transformed into one of the main theatres of military operations. Our people have paid a heavy price in material and human terms in a war in which we had no interest. Since the end of that war, up to the present, the Libyan people has continued to suffer the effects of the war and its aftermath in the shape of mines and explosives sown by the warring countries in our soil. The international community has adopted numerous resolutions in this and other organizations in which it called upon the countries responsible for that to provide the necessary information and the technical assistance for the removal of such mines and other war materiel and to pay reparations for the damage caused. Today, we wish to repeat our call, through you, to the countries concerned to shoulder their responsibilities in this respect, to respond to the calls of the international community and to abide by the provisions of the General Assembly resolutions concerning the aftermath of war.\nThe most recent act of aggression perpetrated against my country was the barbarous military attack waged against us on 14 April 1986 by the previous Administration of a super-Power that is a permanent member of the Security Council. That act of aggression was a flagrant violation of the Charter and the principles of international law and all other international covenants and norms. In addition, there have been numerous provocations and repeated hostile acts perpetrated by that country against my own State since the beginning of the 1980s, side by side with the imposition of a boycott and an economic, scientific and cultural blockade. The international community has voiced its clear condemnation of that treacherous military aggression in various resolutions adopted by international and regional organisations, the foremost among which was General Assembly resolution 38/41, which called on that country to eschew the use of force against Libya, reaffirming the right of Libya to receive compensation for the material and human losses sustained by it. Today, we reiterate our call to urge the country concerned to listen to the voice of justice, reason and logic, to respond to the call for peace and to refrain from any measure which would increase tension and aggravate the differences between the two countries. He call on the United States Administration to engage in dialogue and to resolve every difference, if any, by peaceful means, through negotiation. Ours is a call for peace. Through you, Mr. President, I wish to address a new appeal to the United States to respond to the call for a dialogue on a basis of constructive, honourable and just cooperation.\nMy delegation, which abides by the United Nations Charter and the principles of international legitimacy, respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of peoples to self-determination and non-intervention in internal affairs, calls for the establishment of relationships of cooperation and friendship so as to consolidate international peace and security and bring about tranquillity and confidence among all peoples of the world.\nRespect for human rights has been at the core of the new decade's events, with all its important political changes and developments. In this context, I wish to state that my country has always paid great attention to questions of human rights. This respect for human rights stems from our unswerving conviction that such respect for the dignity of man is the basis for the prosperity and progress of peoples. We are determined to pursue our support for the efforts of the international community, through the United Nations and its organs concerned with human rights, for the achievement of the lofty human objectives we all aspire to. In this context, we welcome the call to convene an international conference on human rights in 1993. My country was one of the first to reaffirm the principles of human rights, in our great green Paper on human rights which was circulated as a General Assembly document in 19B9. This culminated in practical and legislative measures aimed at protecting and enforcing human rights and basic freedoms of expression and the right to gain a livelihood. We call for respect for these rights on both the national and international levels. The beginning of 19B9 witnessed events which consolidated what has taken place in this field. We have enacted a law which enhances freedoms and we have ratified a number of international agreements and instruments in the field of human rights. We have established the International Committee on the Qaddafi Prize for Human Rights, and we have hosted its meetings during the past three years. We have constantly expressed our effective cooperation with all humanitarian organizations dealing with human rights and we have called for the demolition of penitentiaries and the abolition of capital punishment.\nThe problems of the environment are foremost among the concerns of many countries, especially those which suffer from the problems of desertification, drought, natural disasters and pollution. The developing countries have more acutely suffered from the problems of the environment, in addition to the problems of poverty and backwardness and the difficulties of managing natural resources so as to face up to the challenges of development. In this field, my country has faced challenges of development, and very difficult natural and material problems, such as desertification, the scarcity of water resources, the shortage of arable land in the midst of vast deserts and the shortage of manpower. In the circumstances, my country is implementing a great project for a man-made river which is designed to conquer the desert, to spread green vegetation over Libyan lands and to provide a dignified life for the coming generations. The project is based on pumping water from the aquifers in the desert and moving them through a pipeline to the Libyan coast, so that the water may be used for drinking and for irrigation and industry. Praise be to God that we have completed the first stage which involves the pumping of 2 million cubic metres of water daily to irrigate an area which extends for 660 kilometres along our northern coast, through a pipeline 2,000 kilometres long.\nOn 28 August of this year, we celebrated the arrival of the waters of the great man-made river to the Benghazi area. The celebration was attended by a number of leaders from Arab and other friendly countries. We should like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to Dr. Mohamad Mahathir, Prime Minister of Malaysia, who mentioned this project in his statement in the general debate.\nWe take pride in this achievement because we believe that every inch of green added to the arable land of any developing country represents a response to the many-faceted natural challenges facing those developing nations and that every effort made in dealing with the problems of development and backwardness and providing the vital requirements of millions puts contemporary man on the threshold of the proper solutions for the problems involved in meeting the just demands of people and their need to attain prosperity and progress.\nWe have built our man-made river ourselves, without the help of foreign loans or financial assistance. Libya's efforts in the area of such positive undertakings, that aim at the preservation of the environment and the promotion of development make us look forward to the world Conference on the Environment and Development scheduled to be held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which we hope will yield positive results.\nThe Middle East region continues to be one of the most tense of the world's hotbeds of tension because of the Zionist entity's occupation of Palestine and large tracts of Arab territories. Over the years, the international community has adopted numerous resolutions on the Palestinian question, all of which have reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, especially their right of return and their right to self-determination. However, despite this just and steadfast International recognition, the Palestinian people remain deprived of their political and human rights because of Israeli intransigence, which is the basic impediment standing in the way of all sincere international efforts to reach a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question.\nThe intifadah of the Palestinian people against the Israeli occupation is a reaffirmation that when right is on the side of the weak he shall stand invincible against the technology of the unjust. The Palestinian Intifadah has proved that the will of peoples to realise their legitimate aspirations cannot be suppressed. Our position is based on adherence to international covenants. We steadfastly support the right of the Palestinian people to liberate their homeland and to establish their own independent State with a capital in the Holy City of Al-Quds.\nThe immigration of Jews to Palestine from the Soviet Union and other countries and their settlement in the occupied Arab territories today represent the most serious threat to a solution of the Palestinian question. The statements of the Israeli leaders and their call for a greater Israel are clear proof of their sinister intention to create a new demographic situation in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories by altering the demographic composition of the area and turning it into an obstacle to the achievement of any solution of the Palestinian question that would guarantee the restoration of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\nAt present, there is a great deal of talk about peace and the finding of a just and durable solution to the problems of the Middle East and the Palestinian question in line with United Nations resolutions, some of which were adopted about 40 years ago. First, there was General Assembly resolution 181 (II) and then, the many resolutions that followed. The Palestinians and Arabs from Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have expressed their determination to achieve peace. Today, I must clearly state that the ones who do not want peace are the Israelis; those who will undermine every effort to achieve peace are the Israelis. That is because they believe only in the logic of force and war. This is their creed and their unchanging strategy. While the rest of the world moves towards detente. they manufacture weapons of mass destruction. They reject the world's calls to place their nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. They are preparing for a new type of war in the region, namely, the war for water.\nThe suffering of the people of South Africa under the racists and their practices cannot be set apart from the suffering of the Palestinian people in occupied Palestine. We in Libya support the just struggle of the people of South Africa, and we call upon all the peoples of the world to support the just struggle of that people to eliminate apartheid. We strongly condemn the racist practices against the black South African majority.\nAs mine is a country bordering on the Mediterranean, we consider that it is very important to enhance peace, cooperation and security in that region. We hope that it will not become a hotbed of tension in the world or a springboard for direct attacks against coastal States. We still repeat our call to transform the Mediterranean into a lake of peace and cultural exchange and to remove weapons of mass destruction, foreign fleets and bases from it. It should become a model of cooperation between peoples in the north and in the south and an embodiment of the slogan, \\\"No aggression, no invasion, but continued peace and tranquillity, a source of food for the hungry and of shelter from fear.\\\"\nThe problem of Lebanon has been the locus of Arab and international efforts to bring an end to the tragic situation in that country. My country supports national reconciliation that will preserve unity and territorial integrity and sovereignty. However, notwithstanding national efforts inside the country and international efforts outside Lebanon, the Lebanese people still continue to suffer a deep wound in the southern part of their country as a result of Israel's continued occupation of a part of that territory, in brazen defiance of the resolutions adopted by the international community. My country, which has always called for safeguarding Lebanon's integrity, unity and sovereignty, believes that resolving the Lebanese problem requires the immediate and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces of occupation to allow the legitimate Lebanese authority to extend its control over all its national soil.\nGeneral and complete disarmament under effective international supervision is the desired goal of all the peoples of the world. It is incumbent upon all countries, and especially those that possess nuclear armaments and weapons of mass destruction, to do their utmost to advance towards the realization of that goal within the framework of full respect for the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with the priorities spelled out in the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nThat comprehensive view, which we share with many countries, is based on a full awareness of the terrible threats facing our planet as a result of the production, stockpiling and possible use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In that respect, disarmament should involve all the countries that produce and possess such weapons, without distinction or discrimination. The twenty-fourth article of the green paper, which was approved by the Libyan Arab people, states:\n\\\"The citizens of the Jamahiriya call for abolishing the nuclear, chemical and germ weapons, as well as all means of mass destruction and the destruction of all such weapons now in the stockpiles. They call for the deliverance of mankind from nuclear power stations and the danger of their wastes.\\\"\nAs one of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Convention prohibiting bacteriological weapons and the Geneva Protocol, my country supports all international and regional efforts designed to put an end to the nuclear arms race and eliminate nuclear weapons. We also support all international efforts aimed at prohibiting all forms of weapons of mass destruction, without distinction. We support the principle of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts of the world, including Africa and the Middle East. Unfortunately, in this respect our hopes have been dashed by Israel's persistence in possessing, producing and developing weapons of mass destruction in spite of repeated international appeals and condemnations. The Israelis have refused to forgo the possession of nuclear weapons and continue their tests of delivery systems and refuse to place their nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nWith regard to disarmament, we listened with close attention to the proposal of the United States President, George Bush, wherein he declared unilaterally a project for major reductions in the nuclear arsenal of the United States. We believe that this proposal is important and positive. We call upon the United States of America to continue to move in that direction in the service of international peace and security and in recognition of the fact that its technical and scientific achievements are the result of the collective efforts of all mankind, through the immigration to the United States of millions of people from all over the world.\nWe call on the parties that possess weapons of mass destruction - bacteriological, nuclear and chemical - to take initiatives to destroy their stockpiles, to refrain from producing or stockpiling such weapons, and to give a binding pledge that they will refrain from using them and, thereby, save human lives.\nMy country follows with close attention the positive developments towards finding comprehensive political solutions to regional problems. These developments are due to the efforts of the Secretary-General in pursuance of Security Council resolutions. Foremost amongst these problems are the situations in Cyprus, Cambodia and Afghanistan. Given our steadfast stand on the need to search for peaceful solutions to all problems within the framework of full respect for the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and of international law, my country welcomes all efforts to find just and comprehensive solutions to the problems of Cyprus, Cambodia and Afghanistan within the framework of international legality, respect for the sovereignty, independence and integrity of those countries and for their non-aligned status, and the absence of any foreign interference in their internal affairs.\nWe welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General and the use of his good offices towards the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions, and we wish to express our appreciation of his tireless efforts towards the achievement of comprehensive and just political solutions to these problems. My country, which has always provided all forms of material and political support for the just causes of peoples and their legitimate struggle to regain their freedom and independence according to the provisions and principles of the United Nations Charter, wishes to reaffirm its continued support of that struggle. Our desire to see those peoples realise their legitimate aspirations stems from one steadfast and unswerving belief in the cause of freedom and the need to champion the cause of the oppressed everywhere in the world.\nMy country also supports the Korean people in their legitimate aspiration to the achievement of unity through peaceful means and without foreign interference, exactly as the German nation was unified following the fall of the Berlin wall. The first person to predict the crumbling of that Wall was President Muammar Qaddafi.\nJust as we support the right of every people to unity, we also reaffirm the right of the Arab peoples to unity without foreign interference. This is a new phase in history. A page has been turned. We support respect for human rights and for the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and the non-use of policies of destabilization. We wish to see democracy reaffirmed, and dictatorships removed from the world. We hope to see the disappearance of one-man rule and of rule by class, party, tribe, vanguard or elite. We wish to see the sovereignty of peoples enhanced and their will respected. We call for adherence to the principles of international legality on the basis of equality and in line with creative human ideals, so that peace and cooperation may prevail, in the world, the gap between rich and poor nations may be bridged, mutual benefit may guide cooperation between States, and lofty human ideals may reign supreme in our world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, may I congratulate you upon your election, which does justice to the tradition of international cooperation supported by Saudi Arabia and is an eloquent acknowledgement of your own talents.\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the representatives of the new States that have now become Members of this Organization: the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.\nThe admission as Members of the two Republics that form the Korean peninsula is emblematic of an auspicious moment for world peace.\nThe presence in these halls of the representatives of the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania, whose tenacious struggle for independence commanded universal recognition, brings a special kind of joy to the community of nations.\nI also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the balanced and dedicated manner in which he has been exercising, for some 10 years now, the highest-ranking functions of the Secretariat of our Organization. We are privileged to live at a time of universal affirmation of the rights and freedoms of the individual, of pluralism, of respect for the will of the majority, of protection of minorities, of free enterprise.\nThese achievements come in an age that is weary of conflict and arbitrariness. These achievements highlight an essential point, namely that collective Interests always prevail, sooner or later, over the wishes of groups that cling to privilege.\nOur aim is to open up a whole new historical cycle in which there should be no place for totalitarian coercion over peoples or countries, in which democracy, freedom, development and peace can be truly universal values. I address the General Assembly of the United Nations as the representative of 150 million Brazilians, as the elected leader of one of the largest democracies in the world. I come here to join in the celebration of glad tidings. I come here to share in the celebration of joy, but also to share concerns. I come here to celebrate, but also to draw attention to serious problems.\nWe face the challenge of reshaping the world, of building a peace that will not be the offspring of the constant threat of war. The ideological and strategic motivations for global confrontation are fortunately on the wane and exhausted. Sources of tension subsist, however, that still have to be extinguished.\nThe roads towards prosperity and the distribution of its fruits are known to all of us. In spite of that, parochial interests widen the gap that makes our objectives fade in the distance and that has to be bridged in our undertaking. It is as though we were simultaneously heading for common rejoicing in freedom and for separation in inequality. Liberal ideas have won. We should now labour to ensure that they will prevail in a consistent, widespread and, above all, innovative manner.\nSuch observations are made from the viewpoint of a country that has opted for a liberal project clearly oriented towards social concerns, for social liberalism. That is the viewpoint of a society that for 18 months now has been striving to realize those ideas.\nLiberalism places the emphasis on the freedoms of the individual, which are invariably more fully exercised once the material conditions that a great majority of our citizens still lack are assured. The time has come for liberalism to take on, at the international level, the sensitivity to social problems that it has already incorporated at the domestic level. \nLiberalism highly values the freedom inherent in the market, but it cannot turn away from the mechanisms needed to curb distortions and prevent the non-observance of its most elementary rules, as is the case with existing discriminatory and protectionist policies.\nThis means that the international community will have to devote priority attention, at the political level, to development problems. This means supplementing the functioning of market mechanisms with measures intended to correct serious imbalances, the persistence of which would put good relations at risk.\nJust as nobody can feel secure facing the possibility of nuclear war, nobody can consider himself to be secure and at peace in a planet where the poor and forsaken are dramatically expanding in number and in extent.\nI shall not repeat here statistical data and indicators, many of which were drawn up within this Hall and which demonstrate with alarming clarity that developing countries are worse off today than they were 10 years ago.\nWe are approaching a global consensus on the values of democracy and we must carry through its ethical premises. Concern for the individual lies at the very heart of the democratic conscience. Through political participation and responsibility it is individuals who frame the destiny of their collectivity. It is towards individuals that the actions of democratic governments must be oriented, for the aims of such governments are only accomplished if they can ensure each and every citizen the effective means of well-being and justice.\nThe democratic conscience cannot but be universal in scope, since it is based on the overriding principle of equality of rights and opportunities for all. There cannot be relative democracy, under any pretext whatsoever. Thus, it is incongruous that three-quarters of mankind should live in pitiful and often inhuman situations of poverty. If political oppression affronts our democratic values, so does economic exclusion. This is all the more true as the victims of hunger and misery are often children and adolescents, so that the indignation of the present spills over into a future of hopelessness.\nLast year, here in New York, the World Summit for Children revealed a broad consensus that the issue must be addressed at the highest level and with the utmost determination. It is necessary, however, that the international community give concrete shape and follow-up to that commitment.\nIn my country, the Government seeks to mobilize all levels of society to make children our first national priority. At the same time, various measures have been taken, such as the assignment of a special cabinet-level portfolio for children, to coordinate efforts in that area and to launch an ongoing programme to build several hundred integrated facilities, making it possible for destitute children to leave the streets and receive education, food, medical care, and cultural and sports opportunities. With the scarce resources at our disposal, we are earnestly attempting to do our best.\nThe international community faces three major challenges: the economic challenge of development, the political challenge of peace and the ethical challenge of ensuring a life of dignity for all. These are challenges that cannot be met separately but that must rather be faced jointly and simultaneously. These are challenges that must be met democratically, with\nthe participation of all. These are challenges that, in the end, test our ability to elevate solidarity to the highest plane of international relations.\nIt is development that ensures the consolidation of democracy and represents the fundamental premise of peace. Where inequality holds sway, quarrels and confrontation are bound to take root. In a world where universality of values is increasingly pursued, little progress is being made on the path to universal patterns and paces of development.\nWe have a responsibility to build a truly democratic and balanced international society. In a democracy, a citizen abides by the law because he feels legitimately represented in its elaboration. The same principle should hold for norms affecting relations among States: it is participation and not coercion that provides the basic stimulus to lawful behaviour. For that reason, the General Assembly, as the world parliament, where citizens of every country are effectively represented, is the forum where we ought to work together for a better, more just, more prosperous and more peaceful world.\nThe definitive establishment of peace demands decision-making processes that are more open, that ensure wider participation and that are binding on States in a broader and deeper way. The natural course towards meeting the great challenges that lie at the heart of our agenda is cooperation by means of universally applicable rules genuinely agreed upon and followed by States. It is through pluralism born of tolerance, consensus born of understanding, the synthesis born of differing opinions freely expressed that the pillars of genuine cooperation can be built. The General Assembly cannot accept having its legitimate prerogatives diminished, since it symbolises to an increasing extent the triumph of democracy the world over, which in turn opens up the prospect of victory for an international system that is also democratic. The war in the Gulf has shown us the United Nations effectively at work. We count on its ability to influence the course of events and to overcome hotbeds of tension in the international scene.\nPeace in the world is contingent upon peace in the Middle East. Our friends in Lebanon are already joining together to rebuild the country on the basis of a loftier goal - a united, free, prosperous and peaceful Lebanon.\nNow the time has come for the Arabs and the Israelis. The grand design of a region where all may live in peace within internationally recognised boundaries will be realised through respect for the rights of the Palestinian people and a change of attitude towards Israel.\nBrazil strongly supports the initiative of convening a peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all interested parties, aimed at the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. We hope that all parties will display the necessary flexibility to remove obstacles, both physical and emotional, to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region. In this context we believe that the application of labels that have exacerbated mistrust among the parties should be reconsidered.\nAlongside political and economic challenges, the United Nations cannot avoid facing the ethical challenge to which I have alluded. It is necessary to design new approaches and more creative and consensual instruments for action in priority areas of the environment and development, human rights, world population questions and the situation of women and children.\nIn the years leading up to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations we must set down guidelines for international relations in the twenty-first century.\nThe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will be the first among the major universal gatherings to take place in the next few years. The Conference has an Inescapable obligation to future generations, inasmuch as it is they who will stand to benefit most from our work, the main objective of which is to improve the quality of life for all people.\nLasting solutions to global problems require the commitment of the international community as a whole, each country according to its responsibility relative to the origin of those problems and to their management, as well as to its economic and technological capacity to overcome them. The months leading up to the Conference will require intensive consultations. Brazil intends to explore opportunities for dialogue to the fullest and hopes to find its interlocutors to be open and determined.\nPerhaps the most striking characteristic of such a Conference on Environment and Development is that it should allow for as broad a debate as possible, as profound a discussion as the political will of the participants will allow. It is with those objectives in mind, and without constraints or preconceptions, that we believe the issues of the Conference must be tackled and its crowning decisions adopted.\nAt the Conference we shall discuss the economic policies of developed and developing countries alike that are best suited to eradicating poverty and correcting unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. The transfer of environmentally sound technology requires an innovative approach to intellectual property rights that will allow for a regime that effectively favours access by the developing countries to the progress made by the industrialized world in that field.\nThe Conference should not act the stage for grievances and recrimination;\nit should, on the contrary, provide the framework for mature and feasible proposals. In effect, it amounts to finding a proper response to the common interest of ensuring the survival of mankind and of the planet itself.\nJust as the question of development has yielded to other issues on the international agenda, I am concerned that the issue of the environment may also yield to other aspects of the day-to-day life of the world.\nIt is understandable that the dramatic developments of the past two years have attracted considerable attention. But it should be pointed out that the political task of peace building does not take place in a vacuum. It depends on economic development, which, in turn, is dependent on environmentally sustainable economic models.\nWe cannot abide having an environmentally sound planet and a socially unjust world. Hence, the convergence of the political, economic and ethical dimensions on the question of the environment, which ultimately brings together the challenges of peace, development and the improvement of the quality of life of mankind as a whole. Hence, the importance of our commitment to come together at the highest level at the Rio Conference in 1992. I again invite all Heads of State and Government from all regions of the world to be present in Rio de Janeiro. Their participation will ensure that the decisions we adopt enjoy the needed political support. Brazil awaits you all with open arms.\nMy country is striving to ensure its rightful place on the International scene. We are aware of the fact that to that end we must rely above all on our own efforts. It is our obligation to manage our domestic affairs, to solve our problems among ourselves and to persevere on the right path.\nThere is no other path to progress, harmony and social well-being. There is no other path to the role to which we aspire in International decision-making processes. Me ask nothing of the world that we are not prepared to give. We propose nothing to the world that we are not in a position to do ourselves.\nBrazil is too complex a nation to be treated according to standard prescriptions. There are no magic formulas and no economic miracles. We join the concert of nations with an open mind, with a vision of the future and with generosity, and we expect the same attitude in return.\nWe are perfectly aware that respectability is beholden to responsibility. In the course of our national history we have cultivated consistency and responsibility in our international relations, in conformity with the rules and principles of relations among nations. The world is witness to this tradition.\nLast year I announced in this very forum my Government's decision to abstain from any nuclear explosions - including for peaceful purposes, as if it were possible to explode atomic bombs for peaceful purposes.\nOn 18 July 1991 in Guadalajara, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina signed the Agreement on the Exclusively Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. The Agreement has great historic significance for our countries and constitutes proof that it is possible to ensure nuclear security through nuclear cooperation.\nThe Safeguards Agreement that Brazil and Argentina will sign with the International Atomic Energy Agency will provide all pertinent information for verification of our commitment to the exclusively peaceful uses of nuclear energy and will also preserve the technological advances that we have arduously attained in the realm of the nuclear energy cycle.\nLess than one month ago we also signed, together with Argentina and Chile, the Mendoza Commitment, on the basis of which we formally and collectively renounced all chemical and bacteriological weapons. He are aware of the example we have just set for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, and we hope that a similar agreement at the global level will be finalised in the near future. It is Brazil's understanding that the aforementioned instruments afford renewed and sufficient assurances regarding the exclusively peaceful objectives of our national nuclear energy programme and regarding our repudiation of weapons of mass destruction.\nInternational flows of sensitive technology goods, services and know-how are today a vital issue. We should look for formulas that would serve to reconcile two basic interests: avoiding the possibility that such technologies are used in weapons of mass destruction; and ensuring that access to such technologies remains open. This is an essential prerequisite for building and modernising the technological capacity of countries like Brazil.\nIt is easy to welcome change and to exult in the prospects for building a new world. It is painful, however, to speak of the many obstacles that still stand in the way of hope. Among these obstacles we find the acute problem of external indebtedness that drains the developing countries of scarce capital, arbitrary constraints on the transfer of technology and disregard for market\nprinciples under the protectionist policies pursued, first and foremost, by the industrialised countries.\nThe paths leading to an international framework that ensures peace and fosters development are complex and have yet to be defined. There is consensus on the objectives and perhaps on the means, but resistance to real change remains enormous. The great strides that have been made in the ideological and strategic realms must be matched by no less courageous strides towards building confidence and cooperation.\nIn the political sphere, democracy should open up the way for new decision-making procedures in the international field. Security must be an effectively collective endeavour, enforced by law and not by the spectre of arms.\nIf in the economic sphere we have shed the facile and simplistic dreams of radical reform of the international economy, and if we know that great transformations begin with hard work aimed at internal reform, we cannot all the same forgo realistic and sensible proposals for international cooperation. He are committed to fighting for the success of the Uruguay Round in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as we believe that the philosophy of free and open trade should rest on a solid and balanced foundation.\nIn the realm of values, there is a consensus that our first duty is to struggle for the full exercise of human rights on the political, economic and social levels. That is the great objective that international solidarity should attain.\nBrazil is pursuing no other policy than to warn, to caution, to propose and, above all, to collaborate. The growing imbalance between developed and developing countries poses a tangible threat to international stability and security. This threat will only increase if there is no effective support for the consolidation of democracy and development. There is a need to create, at the world level, a sturdily built, consensual programme of action, organised around the question of development, to guide and spur negotiations on specific items pertaining to relations among nations at all stages of economic progress.\nOn the American continent, the enterprise for the Americas initiative, currently known as the Bush Plan, is a first indication of willingness to reach understanding. Along the lines of this same drive towards the actual integration of the continent, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay have signed the Treaty for the Constitution of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUL), which already dovetails with the Enterprise for the Americas through the Rose Garden Agreement, signed in Washington earlier this year.\nIn order to realise the hopes thus raised among the peoples of the region, both initiatives must incorporate as a priority goal the search for a solution to the serious social problems that still confront us. This political, economic and ethical imperative cannot be regarded as constituting a claim by any particular country or group of countries. It is an ensign to be flown by all States, by all governments.\nWe are drawing nigh to the universal and ultimate triumph of the revolution of democracy and freedom. What remains is to carry it through with the revolution of social justice and solidarity. May God be with us.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me. Sir, to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. We are particularly pleased that the representative of Saudi Arabia, with which Ethiopia enjoys close and friendly relations, is presiding over this Assembly. It is my pleasure to assure you of my delegation's fullest cooperation as you discharge your responsibility. \nI also wish to express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, for his able stewardship o\u00a3 the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Indeed it was gratifying to have received Mr. de Marco in Ethiopia in June 1991, barely a few days after the downfall of the military dictatorship that ruthlessly brutalized and dishonoured our country during the past 1? years. Mr. de Marco's fruitful visit to Ethiopia has helped to make the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring countries a focal point of international attention and concern.\nI should like to take this opportunity also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his distinguished service to our Organization, and to congratulate him on leaving behind an Organization with greatly enhanced stature and credibility. He wish him success and good luck.\nLet me also extend my warmest welcome to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands on their becoming Members of our Organization during the current session.\nThe profound changes taking place throughout the world have brought about the emergence of democratic transformation. Now that the cold war is over, international relations have tended to promote cooperation in place of confrontation. Peace is indeed taking root, and freedom is on the march, with peoples, nations and nationalities exercising their rights to self-determination. Tyranny and repression are being wiped out by peoples in full exercise of their will, taking their destiny into their own hands. They are winning in their pursuit of freedom, democracy and justice. \nThe victory of the Ethiopian people over a ruthless military dictatorship is a case in point. I beg the indulgence of the Assembly to speak briefly on the painful experience of the past 17 years in Ethiopia before dealing with the current situation in my country.\nThe international community is aware of the unparalleled suffering and misery endured by the Ethiopian peoples. The blatant policy of war and repression pursued by the defunct terrorist regime, coupled with recurrent droughts and famine, inflicted an enormous human toll. It should be recalled that premeditated murder of Innocent people was the order of the day. Youngsters in their teens were rounded up from schools, streets and homes for forced military conscription. Villages were destroyed by blanket bombing aimed at suppressing people who wanted to be free. The cruel war uprooted hundreds of thousands. A great number of people perished, while others fled in search of refuge to countries near and far.\nI cannot but note with regret and sadness the deafening silence of the United Nations system in the face of gross violations of human rights and its failure to make tangible efforts to stop the mayhem in my country. It is our considered view that this international Organization, whose cardinal objective is \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\", should have spoken out with sufficient vigour, instead of hiding behind a convenient excuse to justify inaction when confronted with the most egregious human rights violations and continual bloodshed.\nIn contrast, donor nations and non-governmental organizations spoke and acted with tremendous dignity and compassion. In spite of the familiar \\\"food as a weapon'' policy of the regime, they persisted in their determination to \nprovide, and sometimes succeeded in providing, timely assistance to victims of drought and famine in our country. He sincerely appreciate this humanitarian commitment.\nThe downfall of the military junta and the successful take-over of state power by democratic forces on 28 May 1991 marked the beginning of a new era of peace, democracy and justice in Ethiopia. At the time when the junta in Addis Ababa was crumbling, talks on ending the war were being held in London on 24 May 1991, under the mediation of the United States Government. In this regard, I should like to seize this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Government of the United States of America and in particular to Ambassador Herman Cohen, a distinguished and able diplomat, the official mediator on behalf of the United States Government, for the painstaking efforts made to arrange the London peace talks, in which the former parties to the Ethiopian conflict took part.\nIt was agreed in London to convene a National Conference in Addis Ababa on 1 July to chart the future political course of the country. The Conference, held on schedule, brought together 24 organizations representing a wide range of political views and aspirations of various nationalities. He were delighted to note that the National Conference on Peace and Democracy was honoured by the presence of international observers, including representatives of 16 Governments, the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the European Community. Their attendance at the Conference has strengthened our determination to work closely with the international community in resolving the formidable problems and challenges confronting our country.\nThe National Conference has charted the future course Ethiopia will follow. It has adopted a charter explicitly based on the United Nations \nDeclaration of Human Rights. This charter is the supreme law of the land for the transitional period, which will lead to multi-party elections to be conducted in about two years. In accordance with the provisions of the charter, the people have begun freely expressing their views. Political parties have emerged and are already introducing their programmes to the people in the run-up to free and fair elections.\nA broad-based administration, embracing various political groups, is in place, acting in the framework of a coalition Government. A landmark principle of the charter is recognition of the rights of nations and nationalities to exercise self-determination, which is the cornerstone of the democratic processes embarked upon by the peoples of Ethiopia. This has opened up new avenues for forcing harmonious peace and unity on the basis of universal human values. We do not believe that there can be lasting peace in our country without recognition and application of this cardinal principle.\nIt has often been said derisively that self-determination would lead to fragmentation and chaos. However, our experience, like that of some countries in Eastern Europe, proves otherwise. To be sure, the denial of the right of self-determination of the various nationalities in Ethiopia and the disregard for their aspiration to equality were the major causes of the civil strife we experienced.\nIt is important to emphasize that recognition of these basic rights by the Transitional Government has done more than consolidate peace: it has also become a significant factor in convincing many groups which in the past worked for separation that their grievances could best be redressed in a new Ethiopia \n\non the basis of recognition of the right of self-determination as the bedrock of its political life. Those groups have therefore decided to give unity a chance.\n \nThe position taken by the Conference on Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia with respect to resolving the long-standing Eritrean conflict must be seen in the context of the imperative need to maintain stability and peace and create conditions propitious to the success of the process of democratisation in the area.\nRespect for the rights of the Eritrean people to determine their future freely in an internationally supervised referendum is, therefore, an integral element of the democratic process aimed at achieving durable peace and stability. In this regard, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia welcomes the decision of the Provisional Government in Eritrea to defer the holding of a referendum for two years, as well as its desire to involve the United Nations in supervising the process.\nThe introduction of political pluralism in Ethiopia is being complemented by new thinking in the economic sphere. The transitional legislature and cabinet will soon approve and adopt an economic policy for the transitional period. A draft economic policy which is currently being discussed and scrutinized by the people envisages the formulation of strategies that could accelerate recovery and reconstruction.\nThe main thrust of this policy is its greater emphasis on private enterprise and market forces as instruments of revitalization of growth and development. It takes into account the need to overcome problems such as famine relief and rehabilitation of displaced persons and demobilized soldiers, in the short run, and the need to expedite the process of laying down the necessary basis for sustainable development, including overcoming environmental degradation and ensuring food security, in the long run. \n\nIt is evident that all this will require vast resources, far beyond the means available to us. It will therefore call for the mobilisation of international assistance in coping with the emergency situation. In this regard, it should be stated clearly that the international community should spare no efforts tangibly to encourage and support the fledgling peace and democratic process in Ethiopia.\nAlthough significant progress has been made towards ensuring peace and democracy in Ethiopia, formidable challenges still confront us. Famine still prevails in Ethiopia, thus threatening the very livelihood of millions of our citizens. Food shortages caused by the recurrent drought and severe environmental degradation persist. Millions of refugees from neighbouring countries and an equal number or more of our own citizens displaced by war are in a desperate situation and are in need of urgent assistance. The infrastructure, shattered by the protracted conflicts, calls for immediate attention. Our economy is completely in shambles due to past disastrous policies and is burdened with a huge loan, the responsibility of the past regime. It therefore needs to be revived, an undertaking beyond Ethiopia's capacity.\nThe accumulation of the economic and social problems to which I have referred not only is bound to prolong our people's life of misery and destitution, but also could frustrate our determination to promote lasting peace, stability and democracy.\nIt goes without saying that it is for us Ethiopians, first and foremost, to put our house in order and resolve our own problems, however vast and complicated they may be. Already the Transitional Government has set a national policy and is mobilizing the people for the difficult but compulsory \ntask of rehabilitation and reconstruction. He are hopeful that the international community will respond positively to our request for assistance and supplement our domestic efforts.\nLet me, at this juncture, turn to the foreign policy of the Transitional Government. Now that Ethiopia is at peace with itself, the opportunities to become a factor for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa - a region torn by conflicts - are greater. Our foreign policy objective is to further and cement ties and promote fraternal common interests with all our neighbours.\nWe are determined to maintain friendly relations with all our neighbours - indeed with all nations - based on principles of mutual respect for the sovereignty and equality of States, non-interference in the affairs of others and the promotion of mutual interests. To this end, we have already taken confidence-building measures. For example, we have waived visa requirements for citizens of neighbouring countries with a view to facilitating cross\u2014fertilization of ideas and communication in order to enhance trade and commerce. We have undertaken measures to preclude the use of our territory by armed opposition groups for destabilization purposes. We are dedicated to do everything possible to bring about peaceful resolution of the fratricidal conflicts in which our brothers and sisters across our borders are engaged. Discussions and consultations are already under way to identify the ventures and joint endeavours which we can develop and harness for our common development needs.\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity, Ethiopia is committed to the promotion of international peace and security. Accordingly, we are concerned that peace in the Middle East still hangs in the balance even as the efforts of the United \nStates Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, are making significant headway towards bringing the patties to the conference table. As a country in close proximity to the region, Ethiopia welcomes such encouraging developments and hopes that the Palestinian question, which is the core of the Middle East problem, will eventually be resolved In accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nSimilarly, we have followed with great interest the encouraging developments in South Africa. While we regard with satisfaction the repeal of repressive apartheid laws and the ongoing dialogue among the political groups in the country, it is important that the process should continue and should lead to the abolition of the apartheid system and the establishment of a non-racial, democratic and united South Africa,\nThe United Nations plan on Western Sahara has come a long way with the establishment of the United Nations Mission on the Referendum in Western Sahara. We are hopeful that the efforts of the United Nations in this regard will be crowned with success.\nWe are anxious about the unfinished business before the United Nations regarding resolution of conflicts. Peaceful settlements in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Cyprus are critical to the consolidation of world peace\nMeanwhile, we are gratified to note the significant reductions in the level of nuclear armaments. Negotiations under way between the super-Powers for further cuts and the recent decision by the Government of the United States to scrap substantial portions of its short-range missile arsenal, as well as the latest proposals by the Soviet Union to match and even accelerate these efforts, will hopefully further the goals of eliminating weapons of mass destruction. \nIn this connection, we support the need for disarmament negotiations to include conventional weapons as well, in the interests of consolidating peace and in conformity with the current trend towards democracy and respect for human rights. It should be stated that the dividends from disarmament efforts should be used to ameliorate the pitiable socio-economic conditions in many parts of the world, thus satisfying the material and spiritual needs of peoples.\nDespite reforms and growth-oriented measures in several countries, most developing countries continue to suffer an ever-increasing decline in standards of living, food production, incomes, and health and educational services. Hot only are we witnessing widespread poverty in both the urban and the rural areas of the developing world, but the gap in incomes between the developed and developing countries has been expanding. In particular, the situation in Africa is pathetic, to say the least. After five years the United Nations Plan of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has very little to its account.\nToday, the lot of Africans has deteriorated even further. There is less food but more mouths to feed; there is more export but less earnings, little savings but little investment; there is more outflow of resources but less inflow of imported goods.\nHow can Africa be expected to address its central structural problems when income earnings continue to decline owing to the collapse of commodity prices? The external-debt burden and debt-servicing obligations of African countries, which as a percentage of gross national product rose from 54 per cent in 1986 to 109 per cent in 1990, have siphoned off from Africa \nresources that could have bean otherwise used for the programme of economic transformation. Furthermore, official development assistance during 1986-1990, which in real terms remained constant at an annual average of $US 16.5 billion, is woefully inadequate.\nIn presenting this bleak picture our intention is not to apportion blame or to deny the importance of the domestic policies of recipient countries. What is needed is a sincere approach and commitment by both developed and developing countries, in a spirit of understanding and accommodation, to address realistically the development bottlenecks in the third world.\nThere is serious international concern regarding environmental degradation. In particular, the region where my country is located is threatened by an alarming increase in desertification. Drought and the successive decline of life-supporting resources have taken a heavy toll. The situation calls for concerted international action to help sustain the minimal resources still available. He hope the forthcoming Conference on Environment and Development to be held at Rio de Janeiro will be both global and specific in scope and produce concrete measures to halt the accelerated pace of environmental degradation, including the problems of encroaching desertification.\nIn conclusion, let me say that we have come with an open mind and with devotion, and that we will thus spare no effort in the collective search for peace throughout the world as well as for progress and development through more freedom and respect for human dignity. We remain convinced that no better means than the instrumentality of the United Nations system exists for ensuring and strengthening the solidarity of nations in the attainment of those noble objectives and in solving common problems in compliance with the\nCharter of the United Nations. The new Ethiopia that now finds itself at an important threshold in its history pledges its loyalty to the lofty ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a very great honour for me to address the Assembly at its forty-sixth session and to convey, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Dominican Republic, our sincere wishes for peace and the well-being of all the nations of the Earth.\nAllow me to express to Mr. Shihabi the congratulations of the Dominican delegation on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I have every confidence that his diplomatic skill and experience will ensure that our deliberations will be fruitful, will help to strengthen international order and make for an even more beneficial peace among all the nations of the world.\nI should also like to express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Guido de Marco, for his competence and dignity, and for the manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the forty-fifth session.\nMoreover, I wish to express our greetings to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar for his inestimable efforts as Secretary-General of the Organisation. The dedication and the zeal with which he has discharged his lofty functions for nearly a decade, and the courage and devotion he has shown in remaining in the service of the ideals of the United Nations, have earned him high praise, which confirms the great esteem in which he is held by the nations of the world.\nMy delegation is pleased to extend a very warm welcome on their membership of the Organization to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Rather than use the time at my disposal to discuss other serious issues on the agenda of the Assembly. I feel it would be more useful to enlighten the Members of the Organization about another small problem that affects just two neighbouring countries, which are perhaps unique in the world, in that together they occupy a small island in the Caribbean Sea and have relatively similar problems.\nIn our statements to the General Assembly, the question of Haiti has, year after year, been a permanent fixture. How could it be otherwise, since geography and history have ordained that Haiti and the Dominican Republic should be two sovereign nations that are in the unique position of sharing the same island? As a result of this propinquity, we have been witness to the political, social, economic and environmental misfortunes that have, like ruinous plagues, befallen the Haitian people. He have seen and felt the burden of the long-lasting tyrannical political regimes that have robbed that people of their freedoms. We have grieved at the social inequalities that have deprived the great majority of the people of education, health and development. As neighbours, we have seen the Haitian people come and go, weighed down, distressed and broken by abject poverty, and we have watched with amazement and sadness as its arable land has been stripped of its plant cover and has virtually been turned into a wasteland.\nA prolific people, the people of Haiti have not been able to find in their own territory the productive land they need, and we have all observed how they have spilled over into the neighbouring area, in endless waves of desperation. Haiti has been accusing us in various international forums of violating the rights of Haitians and of tolerating slavery-like conditions in the employment of Haitians on sugar-cane plantations in the Dominican Republic. And yet, as many times as we have spoken before the Assembly on the question of Haiti, we have done so in order to plead for assistance on behalf of the Haitian people in a righteous gesture of solidarity.\nThis time, after hearing the President of Haiti vehemently repeat this accusation here, we resolved that we should set the record straight and state loud and clear before this world gathering that Haiti's aim is to subject the Dominican Republic to public blackmail and morally bind it hand and feet in a futile attempt to prevent the authorities from performing their duty as the guardians of the moat precious attributes of nationhood.\nWe reject most emphatically the charges levelled by the President of Haiti in his address to the Assembly on 25 September, to the effect that the rights of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic are being violated. This assertion is an unacceptable distortion of the facts. Our historical problem in coexisting with Haiti is the problem that has been brought about by the clandestine immigration of the poverty-stricken agricultural and urban masses from Haiti to the Dominican Republic.\nIt is highly unusual for a Head of State to appear before the international community to criticise another nation for enforcing its laws on public order. What is at issue is the clear-cut exercise by the Dominican authorities of their sovereign rights when, in pursuance of immigration regulations, they order the repatriation of aliens who have illegally entered and are residing illegally in the territory of the Dominican Republic.\nThousands of Dominican men and women have been deported to their own country by the authorities of the United States, Spain and the Netherlands this year because they were living illegally in the territories of those States. However much we may have been pained by these actions, it has not occurred to us to take to any forum to denounce the deportation of Dominicans as a violation of their rights or as offences against mankind.\nHow can it be fair or legal for Spain, the Netherlands and the United States to deport Dominicans living illegally in their territories while it is viewed as unfair or as an abuse for the authorities of the Dominican Republic to repatriate Haitians who have clandestinely entered its territory and are living illegally there?\nWe therefore reject Haiti's attempt to pillory the Dominican Republic before the international community by accusing it of violating the rights of Haitians. The truth is that the great masses of Haitians, strangled by the lack of adequate living space in their own country, have been leaving their territory in droves in search of a place where they can settle down, live and get ahead. No one, absolutely no one, can ask the Dominican Republic, a tiny nation with an area of just 48,000 square kilom3tres and a population of 7,350,000, to assume the burden of all the Haitians who have beer, driven out of their country by desperation and hunger.\nWith the upheaval caused by war in Central America, a little more than 1 million Guatemalans, Salvadorians, Nicaraguans and Hondurans have left their countries to seek refuge - political and economic refuge - in the United States and neighbouring countries. An international conference was held to deal with the issue of Central American refugees, and many programmes and activities - some of them under the auspices of United Nations agencies - were set up for the benefit of these refugees. Many of them have proved to be effective.\nHundreds of thousands of Haitian citizens have come to stay in our country. Is the Assembly aware of the enormous burden which this invasion of our economy has imposed on us, on the economy of a poor country, an economy that cannot provide bread, employment, health, education, clean drinking water or adequate housing for its own growing population? Has the Assembly any idea of the magnitude and enormity of this problem, which is of overwhelming proportions given our extremely limited resources?\nI must tell the Assembly that it is impossible for the Dominican Republic to shoulder the tremendous burden of this immigration, which has been as abundant and torrential as the rains that accompany tropical storms. That is why we make an urgent appeal - an appeal for good will and for the international community to come to Haiti's aid with the dispatch the situation requires. It is the supreme gesture of justice for all of us to shoulder our fair share of the burden, to make an effort to ensure that the Haitian nation is able to accommodate in conditions of freedom and well-being all its children, so many of whom are today desperate refugees from hunger and poverty.\nAware of this situation, the Government of the Dominican Republic wishes to place on record before this world body that it has done everything within its power to seek a peaceful settlement of the problems to which I have referred and to reach agreements between the two parties that, to the fullest extent possible, respect the rights and satisfy the requirements of both countries. It is not Inappropriate to mention here that an official mission headed by Myrtiho Seletin, the Minister for Social Affairs and Labour, recently visited the Dominican Republic on 15 August and had contacts with the Dominican authorities at the highest level.\nDuring these initial contacts between the authorities of the two countries, it was agreed that another commission, similar to the existing one, would be appointed by the Government of the Dominican Republic and would visit Haiti to pursue the negotiations in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Scarcely two weeks ago the first contact was made. The Dominican commission has not yet gone to Haiti, because the Dominican Secretary of State for Labour, who was to head the mission, had to travel to Germany on an official visit and returned just a few days ago to the Dominican capital.\nWhen Haiti's new ambassador, Mr. Guy Alexandre, presented his credentials to the Dominican Government, the President of the Dominican Republic outlined for that distinguished diplomat a broad programme of action which the two countries might pursue with a view to settling their existing problems. \nThat programme provides, inter-alia, for the following: first, the conclusion of an agreement establishing the conditions under which Haitian labourers can be recruited for work in the Dominican sugar industry; secondly, application or this first agreement as a model, with suitable changes, to other areas which, like the coffee industry, hire large numbers of Haitian workers each year for the harvest; thirdly, screening by the Dominican immigration services of the many Haitians, both men and women, who have been living for years in the Dominican Republic and who, in consequence, are entitled to residence permits as temporary workers; and, fourthly, the holding of periodic meetings among prominent intellectuals from both Haiti and the Dominican Republic with a view to creating a climate of understanding between the two countries, since everyone is aware of the damage that has been caused between them by social, economic and historical factors, damage that tends to be aggravated by the abundance of Haitian manpower in the country, which gives rise to unfair competition that depresses the wages of Dominicans and creates a dangerous situation in which the needs of a large part of the Dominican working class go unmet.\nTherefore I should like to conclude by assuring all the members of this world Assembly, especially our brothers in Latin America and in the Americas generally, that today the Dominican Republic is ruled by a democratic Government which respects human rights, which does not discriminate against any foreigners, which does not foster the creation or maintenance of situations of any kind that may affect peace in any part, of the world, and which does not favour the establishment, of barriers between the various members of the human family.\n"

Given the key role that this great Organisation is playing in the epochal state of world affairs, it is strong testimony to the living principles of the Charter that the Assembly would pause now to allow one of its newest Members to speak.\nFirst of all, Mr. President, for the South Pacific Forum and for my country, I wish to refer to the great sense of anticipation brought forth by your election to head this, the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your experience and high standing have made you a most fortunate choice to provide the critical leadership that will enable us all to deal effectively with so many issues which, now more than ever before, can be addressed by this body with a high expectation. You have our warm congratulations and our best wishes. \nI wish also to express thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, as he continues each day, through his diligent service, to enrich the life of every citizen of the world. Today, the United Nations has emerged, during some of the most challenging times in all history, as a stronger and more dynamic Organisation than at any time since its founding. The Secretary-General's unstinting and selfless devotion to the advancement of the principles of the Charter will never be forgotten.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is especially honoured to have been admitted to membership at the opening of the forty-sixth session along with six other nations and to have been able to share with them the sense of joy and fulfilment which pervaded that historic day. Thus, along with our Pacific colleagues of the Forum, we extend warm congratulations to our neighbour and former Trusteeship partner, the Republic of the Marshall Islands. For the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, we rejoice that they have been able to take this long-awaited step together. To the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, their entry here brings a dramatic end to more than 40 years of longing for the restoration of their sovereignty.\nWe hope that the simultaneous attainment of membership by such a large group will encourage yet more nations, both within our Pacific region and elsewhere, to become Members and bring the goal of universality closer to ultimate attainment.\nThe countries of the South Pacific Forum share with the rest of the world deep thankfulness for the many historic victories of the forces of freedom and democracy during the past year. The world is truly moving into an era of government founded upon respect for human dignity. Ho longer need we think of the free world as only half of humanity. The prospect of seeing, within our\nlifetimes, the establishment of the new world order that seemed, throughout most of this century, to be beyond attainment must inspire us all with determination to help those who need special consideration for transitional needs and to make sure that the momentum under way is not lost. This very Organization is now, more than ever, the principal banner behind which the ultimate victory of humankind will be attained.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia was honoured to host the 22nd annual meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Palikir, our capital on the beautiful island of Pohnpei, on 29 and 30 July. The Beads of Government of the 15 member countries within our region reviewed progress and made decisions on a number of issues considered important to the region, which were generally of a political, economic or environmental nature. I shall mention, briefly, some Of the subjects that were discussed.\nRegrettably, the Forum noted that its long-standing deep concern about nuclear-weapon testing in the region cannot yet be put aside. From our perspective, one of the lessons of the recent Middle East conflict is that each and every one of the leading nations of the world must set a strong example if the impulses of some to engage in nuclear-weapon development in support of their unworthy ambitions is to be suppressed. For that reason, we welcome the decision by France, a leading Member of this body, to become a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to sign and ratify the convention of the South Pacific regional environmental programme.\nWe still await, however, a cessation of their testing of nuclear weapons in our region. As Forum Chairman, I cannot over-stress the determination of all the numbers to persevere with, and wherever possible expand, our efforts to reach the consciences of those who seem willing to visit the potentially devastating consequences of nuclear testing on faraway island people but are unwilling to carry out such activities within their own homelands.\nOn a happier note, the Forum was gratified that its earlier concerns communicated to the United States, regarding destruction of chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll, were not ignored. While we were not able to prevent a European stockpile of these weapons from being transferred to Johnston Atoll for future destruction, we remain opposed to that activity within our region. President Bush personally gave a commitment to our Heads of Government, at a summit gathering in Honolulu, that no further stocks would be brought to Johnston Atoll and agreed to permit monitoring of the activity by a Forum scientific mission.\nWe thank the United States for its recognition of our concern, and hope that the point has been made effectively that our region cannot be considered by the larger nations as a convenient empty space for the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste, chemicals and radioactive materials. In that regard, the Forum also loons toward to a strengthening of the London Dumping Convention the next consultative meeting, in 1992.\nThe most immediate and serious environmental threat to the region was recognised to be climate change brought on, or intensified, by the acts of mankind, in particular by emissions of industrially-generated greenhouse gases. The Forum stressed the importance for the international community of developing, and adhering to, a framework convention on climate change containing commitments to immediate and significant reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions by the industrialized countries, and of committing all countries to strive for greater energy efficiency through, among other things, the development of alternative energy sources.\nThe forum further noted with appreciation that the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on a Framework Convention acknowledged the need to address the special situation of low-lying, vulnerable small island States, which will be among the first to suffer adverse effects, or even possible extinction, as a consequence of sea-level rise caused by global warming.\nOn another environmental issue of great magnitude, the Forum welcomed recent progress towards achieving a complete ban on the destructive practice of drift-net fishing. The Forum hopes that the Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Drift Nets in the South Pacific will be effective. The Convention, which entered into force on 17 May 1991, calls for faithful observance of General Assembly resolutions 44/225 and 45/197. It is also hoped that this body will not diminish its vigilance, which has so far contributed greatly to the movement towards the eradication of drift-net fishing.\nIn economic matters, the Forum recognises the need for its member countries to participate more actively in international trade forums. With regard to the current growth and strengthening of regional trading blocs, we hope that these will evolve in harmony with, and not displace, the processes of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. We join other members of the international community in underlining the importance of a just multilateral trading system, in particular for the development prospects of poorer countries. We call for an expeditious and successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.\nThe Forum is, of course, deeply committed in its support for the self-determination of all peoples, including peoples in the Pacific region. We anticipate great progress during the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, and call upon all remaining colonial Powers meanwhile to establish an affective framework within which the human rights, including the right to self-determination, of people living under colonialism are protected.\nA particular focus of Forum attention is, and has bean, on the developments in Mew Caledonia, where a group of Forum-country Ministers recently completed a visit to observe the situation of the indigenous Kanak population. While more concrete action is encouraged, the Forum recognises that the French authorities are pursuing positive measures to promote equitable political, economic and social development in the Territory. It is to be hoped that these and other measures will create an atmosphere in which a peaceful evolution to self-determination will occur.\nThat concludes my statement as Chairman of the South Pacific Forum. I make the balance of these remarks on behalf of my country, the Federated States of Micronesia.\nMany peoples and countries of the world today live in better conditions, and can have hopes for a brighter future, as a direct result of the work of this Organisation. Even so, I would venture to suggest that few others besides the citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia can point to the long and tangible encouragement from this body that my people have received, virtually throughout the entire period that the Charter has been in effect. Permit me, then, Mr. President, on this day to give special recognition and thanks to the members of the Trusteeship Council, all past and present members of the Security Council, the Secretariat, Governments and also individuals who throughout the years worked so tirelessly at our side to bring about the eventual achievement of our goal of self-determination. Forgive me for singling out one particular member in this regard, but the United States, as our former Administering Authority, must receive unqualified praise for its singular commitment and its generosity.\nIn years to come, whenever the people of the Federated States of Micronesia reflect upon the origins of our country, we will be grateful that the United Nations was present early on our journey, to embrace us with the great principle of the Charter respecting the right of all peoples to self-determination. Now, however, we are no longer mere objects of this Organisation's spiritual and material support. He have willingly subscribed to the Charter and accepted all the obligations attendant thereto. It is incumbent on us to make repayment in some part for those long years of the Organization's devotion to our advancement in the only way that we are also devoting ourselves to becoming an effective Member country and discharging faithfully our obligations to make positive contributions. We make that pledge.\nBecause the principles which brought our people together under our Constitution are so closely related to the principles of this body's Charter, we have naturally found ourselves in strong support of the expressions and actions of the United Nations, particularly those directed towards the enhancement of human rights and the suppression of armed conflicts. Even on our remote Pacific islands we cheered when the Berlin Wall came down. He felt repugnance at the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Today we join in calling upon the Government of Iraq to comply fully with all United Nations resolutions. Along with all other peoples, we are deeply relieved by the apparent end of the cold war, but, even as we applaud the momentous events of self-determination unfolding in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, we feel empathy for the difficult choices being faced by so many courageous peoples, and sympathy for their hardships. We pray for as early end to the tragic civil conflict in Yugoslavia. We also pray for the earliest possible release of all hostages held in the Middle East, taking heart from the unrelenting efforts of this body and the Secretary-General.\nBut, because this is the first time my country has taken part in the general debate, and because we associate ourselves with my earlier remarks on behalf of the South Pacific Forum, I will confine myself now to enlarging upon a single topic mentioned earlier, one which is of particular concern; that is, the issue of the world's co-ordinated response to the consequences flowing from climate changes brought on by activities of mankind.\nWe are thankful that the Members of this body had the foresight to convene the historic negotiations now in progress relating to environment and development and to climate change, and look forward to the signing of effective instruments on those subjects next year, in Brazil. Even prior to our becoming a Member of the United Nations, we were given the opportunity to participate in those processes thanks to the Assembly's recognition that mankind's concern with the outcome is truly universal. In that regard, we welcomed the decision to seat the delegation of the Cook Islands at the negotiations on climate change just completed in Nairobi, the wisdom of which was confirmed by the valuable contributions of their representative at those meetings.\nLike a number of countries in the Pacific and elsewhere, the Federated States of Micronesia is an oceanic State comprising small islands within a sovereign territory approaching the size of the continental United States. Our ocean waters, therefore, are vast. Even so, we do not think of ourselves as small islands separated by great empty spaces. The ocean has been, and always will be, our great provider. Its bounty alone is our principal resource for economic survival, and we are conscious of our need to live in constant harmony with it. Until recently, we believed we were too few in number for our actions to affect the great ocean, but while much about it is not yet understood, we have come to realise that the ocean has many responses to man's activities around and upon it.\nTwo of those responses are brought about by ocean warming due to climate change and affect the very habitability of our islands. They are sea-level rise and alteration of marine biological diversity. Both have been recognised by the scientists participating in the intergovernmental panel on climate change, and both must be addressed effectively if our country is to survive and develop.\nAs the oceans are warmed and polar icecaps are subjected to melting due to unnatural concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, ocean levels will rise. I am not exaggerating when I say that islands and low-lying coastal regions in many parts of the world which are now home to millions of people would first be rendered uninhabitable and would, ultimately, disappear completely. No amount of assistance or technology transfer would prevent that outcome, and it could begin to occur within our lifetime. In some reports, migration has been mentioned as a strategy for adaptation, but the experience to date with forced migration of peoples has been uniformly tragic. The only answer is to control the activities that will cause the seas to rise.\nOf almost equal significance to island peoples is the known fact that ocean warming will adversely impact on a wide range of marine organisms, including the corals which are the basis for our reef fisheries and our defence against the violence of the open ocean. In addition, stocks and movements of commercial ocean fish, on which virtually all our plans for significant development are based, would be subjected to changes which the scientists described as profound but which cannot be precisely identified on the basis of current knowledge.\nIt is clear that snail island States are indeed in the front line of countries in the world which are facing dire consequences of climate change brought on by man-induced global warming - consequences which would flow from the impact on our great provider - the ocean.\nI must go further and refer to a major -reason why the warming of the ocean is of concern, not only to low-lying islands but to the entire world. It is that the ocean waters and many of its living creatures, such as corals, are known to be a huge storehouse of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. We know that warming causes those gases to be released from the oceans into the atmosphere, but we are not yet able to project the process with scientific certainty. Given the fact that the Pacific Ocean alone comprises almost one third of the entire surface of the Earth, the risks associated with man's triggering such release through unbridled activities on land are too staggering to ignore. The existence of that and other related oceanic mechanisms is not a matter of speculation. They are a scientific reality and for that reason the interests of mankind dictate that the development of our comprehensive understanding of them be given high priority in the allocation of resources committed by the framework convention.\nAs an ocean island country, we believe it is our place and our responsibility to call attention to the key role of the oceans in our global environment. We, along with other island countries, have undertaken to do so at the sessions of the intergovernmental negotiating committee and, with the support of this body, I am optimistic that the framework convention on climate change will make due provision for this critical consideration.\nIn conclusion, I wish ones more to refer to our joy and our humility at being permitted to speak on this occasion. He did not lightly undertake the responsibilities of membership in this world body. But though we are small, we earnestly hope that the voice of the Federated States of Micronesia will earn respect in years to come for having been raised constructively in the advancement of the Charter and in the work of this, the greatest cooperative undertaking in the history of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Samir Shihabi on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His attributes as a distinguished diplomat are well known to us in Turkey, where he represented Saudi Arabia with great distinction for many years. His country has made a great contribution to peace and stability in our part of the world, and I am confident that under his wise guidance the General Assembly will do likewise on a global scale.\n\nI should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Guide de Marco, the President of the forty-fifth session, for his outstanding performance in guiding the work of the General Assembly during an eventful year.\nThis session of the General Assembly represents a historic step in further consolidating the universality of the United Nations, through the admission to membership of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. My delegation takes joyful pride in welcoming them to the world family, and we believe that this community will be enriched \n\nand strengthened by their contribution to the realisation of the ideals of the United Nations.\nSince the autumn of 1990, when the last General Assembly session started its deliberations, change in Europe has continued at the rapid pace set during the momentous period highlighted by the 1989 revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe and the developments leading to the peaceful unification of Germany. All over the eastern half of the Continent, advances towards democracy and economic reform, although uneven, have been encouraging. The process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) broke new ground when, in November 1990, participating States met and signed the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, which marking the end of the cold war and in which they commit themselves to a new European architecture. The successful international action under United Nations auspices to repel aggression and restore the sovereignty of Kuwait has shown that the world Organization has evolved to the point of assuming its functions as the prime vehicle for resolving disputes and reinforcing global peace and stability. \n\nIn carrying out these functions, our Organisation has had the good fortune to have as Its Secretary General Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, an eminent statesman of great integrity and total commitment to the Ideals of the United Nations. After many years of distinguished service as the highest International civil servant, he can look back to his 10 years of performance with justified pride and satisfaction. In Turkey, we shall always remember him for his dedication to the principles of the Charter and for his impartiality.\nWith the ending of the cold war in Europe and the conclusion of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and START treaties, the world has entered a promising era of transition. These are times of great opportunities. The threat of nuclear destruction now weighs less heavily upon humankind. The numerous local conflicts that were so difficult to settle because of cold war rivalries are gradually becoming susceptible to solutions in which the United Nations will play an increasingly key role.\nAn enhanced United Nations living up to our expectations in this new era of change calls for a more streamlined and more effective Organization. To achieve this, we must pursue our efforts aimed at restructuring the United Nations in line with the demands of operational efficiency. Such restructuring should of course include the reform of the General Assembly. In this respect, I would like to note the singular contribution of Mr. de Marco during his presidency of the General Assembly. I am confident that the reform of the General Assembly and its main committees will continue under your presidency and that this universal forum will emerge as a more faithful mirror of the community of nations and its collective aspirations.\n\nThe era of transition through which our world is passing, although promising, is not free of risks and uncertainties that pose challenges which have to be successfully addressed if our vision for a better international order is to be attained. The Gulf crisis has provided clear evidence of the new resolve on the part of the world community that aggression and violation of international law shall not be tolerated. This new resolve should be maintained and buttressed. Arms control and disarmament is a major field where the current momentum should be sustained and accelerated.\nAs the spirit of cooperation strikes deeper and firmer roots, the effectiveness of the United Nations will also increase. The settlement of the existing conflicts through dialogue and negotiations, rather than by resorting to force, will be facilitated. Thus we can expect an acceleration of the global process of arms control and reduction, to which we should all make our full contribution.\nBy this, I mean the extension into the conventional sphere of the arms control and reduction processes, particularly in those regional and intercommunal conflict areas where the conventional arms race is an important factor in building up tensions and deepening mutual suspicions.\nAnother area where we expect to see the United Nations more active is the protection of the environment. The consciousness is growing all around that the quality of life of future generations and, perhaps, their very survival is dependent on our doing the right things now to protect and preserve our common environment. Turkey is preparing for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in this spirit, and, 20 years after Stockholm, we expect this Conference to be a new milestone in the growing concern of the United Nations for the environment. \n\nTo promote world-wide respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms of the individual is a priority task deserving greater United Nations interest in a changing international environment. There exists a direct relationship between the degree of protection of human rights and the degree of democratisation in societies. Since democracies are less prone to aggressive adventurism, world peace and international stability can rest on stronger foundations only if due observance of human rights on a non-discriminatory basis is ensured on a universal scale.\nThe many risks and uncertainties that cast their shadow on the promises of the current era of transition are often intertwined with various aspects of the question of human rights. Indeed, ethnic rivalries, chauvinistic tendencies, xenophobic treatment of migrant communities, racist practices, religious fanaticism and intolerance can be overcome only through a strict observance of human rights. We must all accept that respect for human rights is an area of legitimate concern for the United Nations and it is in this universal forum that we must strive to establish standards which are applicable everywhere.\nI am proud to say that since the establishment of our republic almost 70 years ago, Turkey has made steady progress in ensuring that its citizens enjoy their human rights to the fullest extent. Turkey has become a party to all the European instruments designed to protect human rights. Turkish legislation is being constantly reviewed and amended to prevent abuses from taking place.\nThe spread of drug addiction and illicit trafficking in narcotics continues to be a global menace affecting all countries. Often linked to arms smuggling and to international terrorism, this scourge has acquired alarming \ndimensions. Turkey believes that the response to this menace should be concerted, forceful and global. We are fully committed to making our contribution to its eradication. We welcome the creation of the United Nations international drug control programme. We are confident that this new structure will play a fundamental role in the international campaign against drugs and in the enhancement of regional and international cooperation.\nThe fate of the peoples of the Balkans and of the Middle East, including the Gulf area, are of particular interest to Turkey. In this context, we attribute importance to the future of Yugoslavia, since peace and stability in the Balkan region depend in large measure on what happens in that country.\nWe are profoundly concerned with the ongoing violence among the peoples of the Yugoslav federation. We hope for an early solution to the conflict through dialogue and in accordance with the will of all the Yugoslav peoples, who should be the only ones to determine the future of their country.\nA speedy settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is crucial to the maintenance of stability not only in the Balkans, but also in the rest of Europe. Hence, we support the peace initiatives of the CSCE countries and sincerely hope that these may yield positive results. We welcome the resolution on Yugoslavia adopted by the Security Council yesterday. \nIn the Middle East, two separate issues are of fundamental importance: finding a just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine and to the Arab-Israeli dispute, while also maintaining and consolidating peace and security in the Gulf area.\nOn many occasions, we have had the opportunity to express our firm stand on the question of Palestine, which lies at the heart of the Middle East dispute. Turkey is convinced that a solution to this problem has to be based on negotiations among all the parties conducted on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nWe are happy to se\u00ab that the efforts of the United States, coupled with the constructive and realistic stand of the Arab countries and of the Soviet Union, have brought about the conditions for holding a regional conference. We earnestly hope that all parties in the peace process will make an effort to prevent this opportunity from slipping away.\nBefore explaining our views regarding the post-war situation in the Gulf zone and on the need for substantially increasing multilateral economic cooperation as part of future confidence building in the whole of the Middle East, I wish to underline how pleased we are to witness the gradual normalization of the situation in Lebanon and the return of peace to that ravaged country. We believe that national reconciliation in Lebanon requires sustained peace and the full implementation of the Taif Agreement. That peace can only be built on the preservation of Lebanon's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Hence, we consider the efforts of the National Reconciliation Government to extend its sovereignty over the entire country to be a step in the right direction. \nThe post-war politico-military landscape in the Gulf zone features a brightening horizon partially clouded by incertitude. Kuwait has been liberated and we welcome the restoration of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as of its legitimate Government. The efforts of the Kuwaiti Government and people to overcome the devastating effects of invasion and occupation are commendable. We are confident that these endeavours, which have already started to yield tangible results, will soon lead to the recovery of Kuwait's pre-war prosperity.\nThe post-war policies of the Iraqi leadership have been a source of major concern for us. These policies have led to a refugee crisis of colossal proportions in the aftermath of the cease-fire. Iraqi policies have also been ambivalent about implementing pertinent Security Council resolutions. Those who have suffered most from these policies are the Iraqi people themselves, who are facing serious shortages and great hardship as winter approaches. Consequently, Iraq's full compliance with Security Council resolution 687 (1991) and subsequent resolutions relevant to various aspects of the post-war settlement is not only the rightful expectation of the international community, but also a prerequisite for the resumption by that country of its place in the family of nations. It is our sincere hope that the Iraqi leadership will act accordingly and that the sufferings of the Iraqi people will thus be brought to an end.\nTurkey believes that genuine multilateral economic cooperation on a region-wide scale could contribute to strengthening peace and stability in the Middle East by bringing about an increased commonality of interests. With each country having a stake in the preservation of regional peace, economic interdependence could pave the way for introducing more advanced \n\nconfidence-building measures, as proposed by Turkey, within the framework of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which held its twentieth ministerial session in Istanbul last August. This first meeting of Islamic Foreign Ministers since the end of the Gulf war resolved to continue deploying efforts in this direction as a means of guaranteeing and contributing to the supremacy of international law, justice and legitimacy in the longer run. It is a source of particular satisfaction to us that the Istanbul ministerial meeting of the OIC thus underscored its dedication to a just and durable peace through dialogue, cooperation and respect for international legitimacy.\nThe spirit of the new times, manifesting itself in moves toward reconciliation and peaceful change, is beginning to prevail over the entire African continent from the Western Sahara to southern Africa.\nRegarding the situation in Western Sahara, we fully support the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices, jointly pursued with the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, in search of an early settlement of the question. In line with this policy, Turkey is glad to make available military observers to take part in the monitoring of the cease-fire that came into force on 6 September 1991. We hope that the parties involved in the dispute will continue to cooperate with the Secretary-General in the implementation of the plan for a referendum in that territory.\nAfter Namibia gained its independence, the process of political change set in motion in South Africa constitutes a source of happiness for my country. Turkey has always adopted a position firmly in favour of the complete elimination of apartheid. We welcome the repeal of the Land Acts, the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act - the pillars of a detestable system \u00ab as historical steps in this direction. Turkey would like \nto see a speeding up of the process of negotiation on the new constitution leading to the establishment of a democratic and non-racial South Africa, which will give it the opportunity of regaining its rightful place in the community of nations.\nThe continuation of the domestic strife which has Drought untold suffering to the Afghan people looms prominently among the problems disturbing peace in Asia and is a source of serious preoccupation for Turkey.\nWe welcome the Baker-Pankin accord announced on 13 September which provides for an end to the delivery of military supplies to the parties as of next January. We hope that this measure will facilitate the quest for a political solution along the lines of the Secretary-General's latest peace initiative launched on 21 May 1991. Such a solution calls for the setting up of a Government representing all segments of Afghan society which, in turn, requires an inter-Afghan dialogue. Hence, emphasis at this stage should be put on the promotion of a sustained dialogue between the Afghan parties that must be conducted alongside the ongoing consultations among the countries concerned. \n\nAs a friend of the Afghan people, Turkey is prepared to contribute further to the search for a political settlement in Afghanistan.\nThe situation in Jammu and Kashmir also continues to be a source of concern for us. It is our sincere hope that the mutual resolve manifesting itself in the ongoing dialogue between Pakistan and India will also find its positive reflection in Kashmir and that a peaceful settlement of the dispute will be found in accordance with the relevant United Rations resolutions and the provisions of the Simla Agreement.\nThroughout the past year the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Turkey have worked intensively for a fair solution in Cyprus based on the political equality of the two sides in the island. We are seeking a comprehensive and lasting solution to a very complicated and delicate problem between two national communities with identities of their own. The reality in Cyprus for the past 28 years has been the lack of a joint political authority competent to represent and speak for both peoples of the island. This is the core of the problem. Both the partnership State and its joint Government that existed in 1960 came to a violent end within three years. In the 28 years that have followed since then, there has been neither a joint State nor a joint Government. A solution in Cyprus will enable the two parties that have been governing themselves separately to come together to share power under new circumstances and within a new partnership. This solution should fully take into account the legitimate rights and interests of both sides and should in no way be the source of future conflicts in the island and beyond.\nDuring the present process under the Secretary-General's mission of good offices, extensive ground has been covered towards developing a draft overall framework agreement; but serious differences have remained between the two\n\nsides on vital issues. A settlement depends on an agreement on these issues between the two parties in the island.\nFour months ago Turkey proposed a quadripartite meeting on Cyprus to be attended by the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders as equal parties and by Turkey and Greece at a high political level. This proposal, intended to give a strong impetus to the mission of the Secretary-General, was rejected at the time by Greece and the Greek Cypriot side. Despite this rejection, the idea of a high-level meeting on Cyprus has continued to enjoy wide support. The general understanding that has emerged is that such a meeting can take place only after the two sides in the island have reached full agreement on all aspects of the problem.\nHe hope this point can be reached in the near future. He hold the view that the lack of direct contacts between the parties in Cyprus and the deep mistrust between the two communities continue profoundly to complicate the process. He are convinced that, should the two leaders in Cyprus resume direct contacts, the likelihood of narrowing existing differences would be greatly enhanced. He believe this to be both necessary and natural between two parties which will be called on to cooperate and share power under a settlement.\nAt the same time, there is an urgent need for the parties to move towards establishing a new and constructive relationship based on mutual respect. Recently the Turkish Cypriot parliament unanimously adopted a resolution which calls for the implementation without delay of confidence-building and goodwill measures in order to create a constructive atmosphere between the two sides and to establish a peaceful basis for their relationship. \nAs a result of these efforts by the Turkish side to lead the way to a freely negotiated and mutually acceptable settlement, the problem now stands on a new plane. This new stage calls for an even-handed approach by the international community in support of an agreement based on the consent of two equal parties: the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots. What is required at the moment is not recriminations and the pursuit of unrelenting confrontation but a new mentality which will bring about positive change. We know the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to pursue this constructive path.\nLet me now turn to international economic issues. The profound political changes we have witnessed in recent years are also having their effect on the economic front. The greater integration of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and of the Soviet Union in the global economy should bring opportunities to the developing countries. The high-level debate held during the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council has been helpful in providing a better understanding of these developments. At present we are witnessing a great convergence of economic policies, unlike anything seen in the past. Even though there is a greater tendency towards global integration, the difficult problems of the past decade remain essentially unchanged. The developing countries still suffer from poverty, unfavourable terms of trade, excessive foreign debt and serious environmental problems. Despite these difficulties and even though economic growth in many developing countries continues to be unsatisfactory, there are reasons to be hopeful.\nThe prospects for growth in the developing countries would appear to be based primarily on three factors: the policies that they will adopt themselves, the economic performance of the industrialized countries and the \n\nability of the international economic system to back up the implementation of effective policies by the developing countries.\nThe progress achieved on the debt issue, compared to the overall volume of foreign debt, remains modest. Debt reduction agreements for certain countries have given rise to some anticipation. The case-by-case approach should encompass all debtor nations, with special emphasis on the least developed countries.\nA major vehicle for the developing countries to break the burden of foreign debt and pursue their development is trade. Trade provides a very important opportunity for developing countries to promote economic growth and to narrow the gap between themselves and the industrialized countries. However, the persistence of trade protectionism diminishes the possibilities offered by expanded trade. Many important decisions depend on the success of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. In this respect, we welcome the declaration by the Group of Seven in regard to concluding these negotiations successfully before the end of 1992.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our hope that this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and will contribute to the security and well-being of all nations. My delegation pledges to contribute fully to the attainment of our common objective.\n"

We are confident that under your guidance the current session will successfully discharge its eminent duty.\nI should like on this same occasion to convey our very high appreciation for the vast efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, on behalf of peace and cooperation among nations. Such achievements assume even more significance in view of the powerful and complex changes the world is undergoing.\nWe extend warm greetings to the delegations of the new Member States that have joined us this year, namely, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania. It la with particular pleasure that we welcome the presence in our midst of the delegation of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, representing Cambodia and its people and led by H.R.H. Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\nWe are living through the early years of the last decade of the twentieth century, which are witnessing the most powerful and far-reaching developments since the Second World War. The world at present offers an overall picture of serious contradictions. On the one hand, mankind is enjoying the fruits of the tremendous advances in the contemporary scientific and technical revolutions; on the other, hundreds of millions of human beings in developing countries are being crushed by poverty and squalor.\nFollowing seven or eight years of recovery, the world economy is now confronted with the possibility of a new recession. International economic relations are characterised by a certain degree of confusion. Regional conflicts are being successively settled through peaceful negotiations; there is a growing trend towards international cooperation in peaceful coexistence for the sake of development; and new progress continues to be made towards the reduction of nuclear weapons; nevertheless, the nightmare of war still haunts humanity. The Gulf war has hardly come to a close, leaving in its wake a host of ensuing problems to be solved in the Middle East, when the seeds of other conflicts continue to grow or are starting to grow in various parts of the world.\nIn a world in full-scale transition, where the basic factors underlying the international order of the past 45 years have radically changed, a new international order is bound to take shape. This is a reality with which \nevery member of the world community, especially among developing countries, is concerned, inasmuch as it will strongly affect the vital interests of each nation-State on our globe as well as the future of the development of the whole of mankind. Some will raise the possibility of a unipolar world, while others evoke the prospect of a Multipolar world. It can, however, be readily asserted that the primary imperative of nations is to preserve peace and national independence and to promote cooperation towards development. The peoples of the world are moved by a most intense desire for peace, cooperation and development.\nIt is our view that in the shaping of the new world order such a legitimate will and desire cannot be ignored and that it la indispensable to take into account the forceful resolve of each State, large or small, to defend its right to be master of its own national destiny and to participate on an equal footing in common world affairs and in the major issues within its own region. The world needs a more just and saner new international order, A definitive end must be put to all forms of hegemony, of military, political or economic intervention or coercion by large countries against smaller ones, by the minority at the expense of the majority. Nations need to cooperate freely on an equal footing and to mutual advantage for the common cause of peace and development.\nOne of the major concerns of the international community is the imperative need for economic development. The fierce economic and scientific and technological race that is taking place around the world is widening the gap between developed industrial nations and developing countries. The latter are still battling with a series of detrimental factors: the dwindling flow of resources from developed industrial countries; the increasingly heavier foreign debt burden; the strengthening of protectionist barriers by some industrial countries; the decline in primary commodity prices; the lack of encouragement for the efforts of developing countries to promote South-South or regional cooperation. As a result, the economies of these countries are steadily deteriorating, with a very negative impact on the whole of the world economy and on international economic relations. Meanwhile, the Uruguay Round and the Group of Seven meeting have failed to bring about any positive change in the international economic order, which remains unfair. Together with the other developing countries, we call on the developed industrial nations to put a rapid end to the policy of economic blockade and pressure, to renounce unequal economic relations and to create an international economic environment that is favourable to third world development. The United Nations ought to adopt even more active and effective measures to help developing countries overcome these difficulties, so as to achieve the economic aims of the International Development Strategy for the United Rations Fourth Development Decade (1991-2000).\nGiven the shift in the bipolar alignment of political and military forces across the world, multilateralism assumes an even more enhanced position than before. The United nations, the largest international organization encompassing the near totality of the States of the world, will become the ideal place for countries to carry out their policy of broadened and diversified relations and to build for themselves as well as for their respective regions a political balance that is both flexible and durable. During the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly last year a sizeable number of delegations spoke of a revitalized United Nations now in a position to effectively discharge its mission under the Charter and thereby to rid itself of the powerlessness and pessimism that used to mar its image at the time of its fortieth anniversary in 1985. United Nations activities and contributions over the past year have, however, demonstrated both the possibilities and the limits of the role it can play in the settlement of regional conflicts and crises.\nA reform of the United Nations is necessary if it is to adapt to the new world circumstances and to live up to the expectations of the larger number of its Member States as underlined by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in his annual report on the work of the Organization, where he expresses\n\\\"the hope that the unity of the permanent members of the Security Council will be complemented by a balanced constitutional relationship within and between the various principal organs\\\" (A/46/1, p. 2(f) and says that two years ago, in his annual report in 1989, he had stressed that \\\"agreement among the permanent members must carry with it the willing support of a majority of nations if it is to facilitate movement towards a better and a saner world. Events since then have lent emphasis to that observation.\\\" (ibid.)\nWe share the viewpoint of many countries which think that the United Nations mechanism should be further improved as far as the structure and the functioning of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Secretariat as well as a more balanced interrelationship among these organs are concerned. This would allow the United Nations to become an efficient instrument in the settlement of international problems and in particular to provide encouragement for and support to interested parties and regions in the solution of existing crises and in the prevention of new crises on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of nations and for the Charter of the Organization. In view of the changing world there can be no reason why the United Nations should be considered an immutable institution. He are of the opinion that today all Members of our vast Organization share a common wish to promote the role and effectiveness of the United Nations but still differ on the scope of the reforms needed to increase democracy within the Organization and the ways and means of carrying them out. The developing countries, and essentially the non-aligned nations, believe that\n\\\"The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which represents the majority of States and peoples of the world, must play a more important and more concrete role in the restructuring of the new international system if the latter is to be legitimate and acceptable.\\\" (Accra Declaration) In our view the United Nations should be able to readjust itself according to the general world trend so as to become a more dynamic and representative world body.\nIn our nation's endeavour to achieve peace, development, democracy and social progress, the year 1991 assumes very great significance. On the strength of a positive balance-sheet in the main fields after a few years of implementation, Vietnam has reasserted the necessary and irreversible nature of its policy of all-round reform and renewal charted since 1986 with a view to focusing on the solution of pressing economic and social problems and maintaining political stability while rearranging the various spheres of social life in consonance with Viet Nam's characteristics. Such re-assertion acquires even greater practical and realistic significance in the new world conjuncture and constitutes a pressing, not to say vital, objective requirement for our people.\nThe phasing out of the bipolar world is entailing for all countries the need to diversify their political and economic relations so as to be able to take advantage of all existing opportunities and possibilities to serve the cause of the nation and at the same time to wrest for themselves a new position of flexible as well as durable balance that constantly allows for self-readjustment according to the evolution of the whole. If the balanced diversification of external relations represents an overall objective trend in the new conjuncture, in the case of Viet Nan, a developing country still battling with countless difficulties, this constitutes a crucial priority in its current foreign policy which should enable it to stove out of the crisis and resolutely to tackle the task of development. Viet Nam's foreign policy aims at promoting cooperation on an equal footing for the mutual benefit with all countries, regardless of their socio-economic systems and on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. From this rostrum, Viet Nam once again solemnly declares its intention to extend the hand of friendship to all countries in the international community and its commitment to work for peace, national independence and development.\nThe interests of Viet Nam, as a developing country in South-East Asia, are closely linked to those of the region. With the purpose of shaping for itself an international environment favourable to peace and development and of putting its open-door policy and the diversification of its relations of international cooperation into practice in an effective way, Viet Nam pays particular attention to the constant improvement of its relations of friendship and cooperation with regional and neighbouring countries and to making a positive contribution to the cause of a stable, friendly and cooperative South-East Asia.\nWe are highly gratified to see the recent positive developments in South-East Asia and, in particular, the prospect of a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian question in a spirit of national reconciliation among Cambodians. The attendance of the delegation of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia for the first time at a session of the United Nations General Assembly, and the agreements reached among the Cambodian parties at the recent meetings of the Supreme National Council on the internal aspects of a solution to the Cambodian question are new and important steps in the process of restoring peace in Cambodia that make the reconvening of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia possible. These results are eloquent testimony to the fact that Cambodians are fully able to resolve matters pertaining to their sovereignty in a spirit of national reconciliation with the support and cooperation of countries concerned and of the United Nations. Viet Nam reiterates its principled position whereby it will respect any decision of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia on all questions pertaining to Cambodian sovereignty. As for itself, after its unilateral withdrawal of all its forces from Cambodia since late in 1989 in the absence of a peaceful settlement, Viet Nam is ready to join efforts with parties concerned in order to reach a comprehensive, fair and reasonable political solution for the Cambodian question based on respect for the Cambodian people's sovereignty and right to self-determination and on respect for the Charter of the United Nations, thereby allowing Cambodia to become a peaceful, independent and neutral country that will contribute to peace, stability and development in South-East Asia and in the world.\nAgainst the background of a forthcoming solution to the Cambodian problem, of the notable improvement in relations between Viet Nam and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and of the evolution of the normalization process between Viet Nam and China in a direction favourable to regional peace and stability, Viet Nam believes that the countries of South-East Asia now have a better opportunity than ever to build together a region of peace, stability, cooperation and development after several decades of conflict and confrontation.\nThe compounded impact of the trend towards unification of the world market, of the speed and force of the scientific and technological revolution, of the movement towards regional integration in several parts of the world and of the perspective of changes in the military presence and the involvement in this region of various Powers makes it necessary to \\\"re-think\\\" South-East Asia through a new approach, new avenues and within a new context, and for countries in the region not only to support one another in the common endeavour of socio-economic development, but also to consult with one another with a view to finding appropriate ways and means for the establishment of a new regional security - all-round security, of which economic development is the primary component. On 10 September, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam addressed to the secretariat, the Chairman of the Standing Committee and the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN an official request for accession to the 1976 Bali Treaty, wherein Viet Nam expressed its desire to strengthen relations of amity, good-neighbourliness and mutually beneficial cooperation with ASEAN countries so as to build a South-East Asia of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation and thus to make a contribution to the cause of peace and development in the world.\nGuided by our position of renewal in foreign policy, we are constantly aware of the need to promote regional cooperation as an indispensable premise in the implementation of our policy of expanding our relations of international cooperation and of consolidating the relations we have had up to now with friendly countries and with non-aligned countries, together with the need to broaden cooperation on an equal footing and on the basis of mutual benefit with other countries in Asia and the Pacific, in Western Europe and Scandinavia, and to promote the normalization of relations with the United States. Proceeding from our evaluation of initial results in our policy of reform and renewal, of our country's rich potential in natural resources and manpower, of the development trend of our times and of our people's aspirations, Vietnam has set for its strategy of socio-economic development to the year 2000 the following objectives: to move out of the crisis, stabilise the socio-economic situation, strive to take Vietnam out of its state of poverty and underdevelopment, improve the people's conditions of life, consolidate our defence and security and pave the way for our country to be able to develop faster in the beginning of the twenty-first century. We are convinced that, given our will and determination and with the cooperation of the international community, we shall be able to reach that objective and, as an active Member of the United Nations, to contribute increasingly to the common cause of peace and development.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour, Mr. President, of conveying to you a message of peace, friendship and solidarity from His Excellency Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the Central Committee of the UPRONA Party and President of the Republic of Burundi.\nI should also like to express to you, on behalf of the Government of Burundi, my warmest and most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. With your diplomatic experience and your devotion to the ideals of peace and international cooperation, there can be no doubt that our deliberations will be crowned with success. By electing you to the presidency of the General Assembly, the international community has placed its trust in you and is your country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which my country has excellent relations. I can assure you that my delegation will give you every support to ensure that your noble mission is discharged to the satisfaction of the entire international community. \nI want also to congratulate the other members of the Bureau who, I am certain, will do all they can to help you carry out your weighty responsibilities. We convey our appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, who presided over the work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly with great ability, dynamism and devotion. He was a credit to the United Nations and to his country.\nFinally, I convey my sincere thanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his untiring and successful efforts to preserve world peace and security.\nThe Republic of Burundi joins other delegations in congratulating and welcoming the new members of the United Nations family: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\nIn our view, the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas will not mark the end of work towards the reunification of the Korean nation, which has already progressed far in that direction. We may hope that in the near future we shall be present here at the culmination of those reunification efforts, and that the dream of the fraternal people of Korea will finally come true.\nBefore stating my country's views on some of the items of concern to the international community at large, I want briefly to describe the current situation in Burundi.\nSince 3 September 1987, the Government of the Third Republic has been pursuing its goal: the restoration of national unity, social justice and development for all in the context of a genuine democracy. As I have said before from this rostrum, the people of Burundi want to live in peace, order and tranquillity. We want our country to be safe for all; we want a country of unity, from which hatred and vengeance are forever banished.\nAs members know very well, national unity is the vanguard and cornerstone of all progress. The Government of Burundi continues to match its words with deeds by adopting concrete measures to strengthen national unity and reconciliation.\nThe formation of a Government of National Unity; the creation of a National Commission to study national unity; the establishment of a National Security Council; and the massive repatriation of refugees; all these are incontrovertible facts that prove the wish of the Government of the Third Republic to build a just, democratic and prosperous society.\nThanks to the policy of dialogue and cooperation that marks the political activities of President Buyoya and his Government, the people of Burundi adopted the Charter of National Unity by 89.21 per cent of the vote. The adoption of that Charter, on 5 February 1991, was a victory over the forces of division, selfishness and injustice. The people of Burundi have thus rejected division; they have rejected the law of the jungle, hatred and all forms of exclusion. That Charter will provide the foundation for the institutions to be established in our country.\nHaving reached this important stage on the road to unity, the people of Burundi are now democratizing their political life. The Constitutional Commission set up on 21 March 1991 has just submitted its report emphasizing the values that democracy can promote, addressing political pluralism and proposing basic State institutions, their organisation and their functioning. To indicate that unity must remain the basis of democracy, the Commission proposed the creation of a National Council of Unity and the retention as permanent institutions of the National Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.\nThe Constitutional Commission will be organising and encouraging debate throughout the country to enable the people to express their views on the proposed institutions. The constitution of the Republic of Burundi will be approved in a referendum early in 1992.\nThe future constitution of Burundi will bolster the policy of national unity and respect for human rights, a policy the Government has been following for four years. That policy was manifested in the ratification of international human rights agreements and the African Charter of Human Rights and the Rights of Peoples.\nA meaningful policy of national unity cannot neglect the question of refugees. For that reason, the Government has made all the necessary arrangements and has created conditions favourable to the voluntary repatriation of Burundi refugees. More than 10,000 refugees have already returned and have taken up residence, and others continue to come.\nThe United Republic of Tanzania, which for some time has given shelter to the vast majority of our refugees, contributed to a final solution when on 28 August 1991, with Burundi and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it signed an agreement establishing a working group to promote final solutions to the problem of Burundi refugees in Tanzania. We greatly appreciate the friendly and brotherly action of the United Republic of Tanzania, which has promised to grant Tanzanian nationality to Burundi refugees who for one reason or another have chosen to live permanently in that country. Thus there will be no further talk of Burundi refugees in Tanzania.\nThere has been a surge in the Burundi people's solidarity with their brothers and sisters who have returned to the motherland. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the week of 10 to 18 August 19S1 was declared the Week of Solidarity with Burundi Refugees. In that connection, the people supplied food, clothing and construction materials, not to mention financial assistance.\nBut the needs remain enormous, and any contribution from the international community will be welcome. We take this opportunity sincerely to thank the friendly countries, international organizations and private donors who have provided support for our work.\nDespite the courageous policy of economic reform followed since 1986 with the support of the Bretton Woods institutions - the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - and other funding sources, and despite the fact that some encouraging results have been achieved, my country still faces serious economic problems. Essentially, these are linked to the plunge in coffee prices and to the fact that Burundi is landlocked. It is to find solutions to those economic problems that Burundi's Economic and Social Council has sought to devise ways and means to achieve harmonious development. Its proposals are now the subject of widespread national debate. The Government is trying to make the population aware of the imbalance between population and resources resulting from the demographic explosion.\nMy Government is putting together a nationwide campaign to show that a vigorous birth-control policy is vital if we want to continue to faced our people and ensure its development.\nDespite the high priority we attach to our domestic policies, our country is not shut up in an ivory tower; it continues to be open to the world. We are convinced that this is the era of interdependence and solidarity among nations, regions and peoples. For four years Burundi has been working to build foreign-relations policies based on trust, dialogue and cooperation. There can be no doubt that we are now at a decisive, historic stage, where all our efforts should be focused to consolidate and make irreversible all the positive trends that have been seen, so that relations between States acquire a new dimension. The new dynamic that is now a feature of international relations, which have bean freed of the burden of the cold war, offer great hope of stability and open up prospects of peace, understanding and cooperation. They have made it possible for our Organisation and the Secretary-General to contribute in a masterly way to taking specific initiatives to settle a number of conflicts that have gone on for too long.\nLasting solutions have been found to some conflicts that have gone on for many years. Examples include Angola, Lebanon and Cambodia. Real peace efforts have been made elsewhere. The successful missions that have already been carried out and the renewed trust in our Organization give genuine grounds for satisfaction and above all for hope. It is my country's desire that all those involved in conflict will rediscover the virtues of dialogue and cooperation, which are the only weapons that can bring about peace.\nIn speaking about conflicts in certain countries, I cannot fail to refer to the conflict raging in Rwanda, a friendly neighbouring country linked to mine by solid geographical, historical and cultural ties. In economic matters Rwanda and Burundi are complementary countries. Moreover, they belong to the same regional groups, such as the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL), the Organization for the Management and Development of the Kagera River Basin (KBO) and the Eastern Southern African Preferential Trade Area (PTA). For all those reasons, Burundi has taken part in all the meetings held to seek a lasting solution to the crisis in Rwanda and we continue to be concerned about the continuing armed confrontation, which is causing loss of human life and the destruction of Rwanda's economic potential.\nWe make an urgent appeal to the partial to the conflict to respect the cease-fire agreement signed in N'Sele on 29 March this year and without delay to embark on negotiations to find a lasting solution. We repeat our commitment to support any action promoting the return of peace to that brotherly country. We have been following with great interest the steps taken by the South African Government to abolish segregationist laws in South Africa, and we urge that Government to pursue its negotiations with the anti-apartheid movements with a view to eliminating the apartheid system once and for all. Burundi believes that remarkable efforts are needed, and if they are to be successful the understanding and support of the whole international community will be required. My delegation sincerely appeals to the entire people of South Africa to unite to gain this victory, for which a great deal of courage and restraint are needed.\nWe are convinced that peace is possible in the Middle East if the parties to the conflict agree to get together round the negotiating table. Burundi therefore hopes that an international conference on the Middle East will be organised so that the peoples of the region may live in peace. The Palestinian people are entitled to a homeland, a sovereign State, within secure and internationally recognized borders. That is why my country supports and encourages all the initiatives to restore peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.\nThe eyes of all of us are now focused on the forthcoming international peace conference, for which the United States Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, has been working tirelessly, not without difficulties, to come up with a formula acceptable to all the parties concerned. My delegation hopes that those efforts will be crowned with success, A sine qua non for success continues to be open cooperation and the commitment of all the parties concerned.\nThe Gulf crisis once again demonstrated the fragility of peace in that tragic part of the world. The invasion of Kuwait, followed by Kuwait's annexation by Iraq, was an act of aggression condemned by the whole international community. International law had been violated. All countries, however powerful, must respect the territorial integrity of other States, refrain from intervening in the internal affairs of other States and avoid recourse to the use of force to settle disputes. The invasion and occupation of small States cannot be tolerated in today's world.\nThe mobilisation caused by the Gulf crisis in defence of international law should continue in defence of human rights and the rights of peoples, wherever they are violated. Following a policy of double standards in similar situations can only mean the death of international law, as Mr. Francois Mitterrand, President of the French Republic, said here last year. I have outlined a challenge that must be accepted, because it is the only way to restore peace to the region.\nWe also appeal to our friends in Yugoslavia to have the necessary political courage to get round the negotiating table, with the help of mediators, to restore peace swiftly to their country. Apart from the problems to which I have referred, Africa has now embarked on an important stage of its history involving the democratisation of its institutions. However, democracy that does not have a sound economic base is only a mirage, condemned to failure from its very birth. Africa, like the rest of the world which has embarked on this course, therefore needs a great deal of careful attention and more support so that it, too, can write its name on a page of the history of democracy.\nThe United Nations, which can congratulate itself on having been in the vanguard in world events recently, has recovered its former prestige, and its moral authority is growing daily. It is playing a major role in guiding the international community towards political harmony and economic and social progress.\nWe must also be aware that development and peace - in effect, the security whose creation and development are a task of our Organization - are inseparable from disarmament, which is the instrument for bringing them about rather than the end product.\nThe Government of Burundi welcomes the recent initiative by the United States President, Mr. George Bush, who has just announced important disarmament measures. We hope that the other nuclear Powers will follow that example and that this step will be followed by others, eventually leading to complete disarmament.\nA very positive factor for disarmament is that the concept of security has today been broadened and that its non-military aspects - political stability, respect for human rights, the legitimacy of governments, people's living conditions, the environment and so on - have become more and more important and are linked.\nSuccess in this area would free sufficient funds to enable the United Nations to carry out the work of peace and security, which cannot be dissociated from the other responsibilities conferred upon it by the Charter. Here I refer to the improvement of living conditions throughout the world, particularly by organizing equitable international economic relations.\nWe are concerned about the real danger that the flow of development finance will dry up. At present the demand for outside capital is greater than the supply, because of the needs of the economies of Eastern Europe and of a changing Soviet Union.\nMy delegation has already had an opportunity to take careful note of the reassuring declarations made by aid-donor countries and organisations to the effect that the developing countries will continue to receive the same amount of financing. We welcome the position of the Group of 7, the seven most industrialised countries, taken at their last summit meeting, and we urge all the decision-makers in that important group of countries to demonstrate their active solidarity with the countries of the South.\nIn doing that, we dare to hope that words will be matched by deeds, particularly at this time, when Africa faces enormous dangers of marginalisation. We therefore support the idea of an international conference on finance for development, which was suggested by the Secretary-General in Geneva during the recent session of the Economic and Social Council. \nThis conference, whose purpose would be, inter alia- to identify sources of possible financing aid to devise machinery which would make it possible to allocate the necessary resources to a growth and development programme, must be seriously prepared for if we are to achieve concrete results.\nThe debt crisis, which we have been deploring for so many years now, unfortunately remains acute. The various proposals and initiatives made with a view to coping with this problem have not yet achieved any tangible results. On the contrary, the developing countries in general and Africa in particular are becoming more and more enmeshed in this crisis. Although certain countries may have benefited from various measures providing for debt cancellation, relief or rescheduling, the moment seems to have come to take courageous global and pragmatic steps towards all the debtor countries of the developing world.\nNevertheless, as recently acknowledged by the Secretary-General, the situation in Africa, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, requires even bolder steps and exceptional treatment with respect to official and semi-official debt, as well as private and commercial and multilateral debt. Therefore, we give full support to his proposals with a view to reducing or cancelling those types of indebtedness.\nIn another area, the final examination and evaluation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, has just taken place at the Headquarters of our Organization. One of the merits of that exercise has been to demonstrate that however fine and clearly drawn an economic programme may be, it cannot achieve anything unless it is adequately financed. The causes of the failure of the Programme of Action have been diagnosed, as were the future prospects of the African economy for 1991 and beyond. My delegation hopes that the new framework for international economic cooperation initiated to this end will benefit from more commitment on the part of the donor countries so as to guarantee a greater mobilisation of funds for Africa.\nWe welcome the Japanese initiative to host the International Conference on the Development of Africa, to be held in Japan in 1993, with the participation of African Heads of State. My country hopes that the meeting preceding that Conference which is to be held in Japan next year will be very carefully prepared.\nDespite the uncertainty which besets the world economy and the risks of marginalization of the African continent from international economic trade, it is unthinkable that the peoples and Governments affected by the crisis will yield to discouragement. At present, a large number of developing countries, including my own, are experimenting with structural adjustment programmes. The results of these economic reforms are still limited and their social cost remains high.\nAlso with a view to re-launching economic growth and integration in the African continent, our Heads of State and Government, at a summit meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, from 3 to 5 June 1991, signed a Treaty establishing the African Economic Community. We therefore appeal to the international community to contribute increased aid for the achievement of this goal.\nWe consider the problems of underdevelopment and poverty to be among the causes of conflicts which pose a threat to international peace and security. Furthermore, we believe that without peace it is impossible to strive for development, and without the development of the peoples of the developing countries it is impossible to conceive of an honourable and real peace, valid for all.\nAfrica, which occupies one quarter of the Earth's surface and which at the beginning of the next century will have one fifth of the world's population, deserves particular attention. Sooner or later these enormous problems will affect all mankind. A world which disregards a continent with such a potential will be an impoverished world for ever.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will be held in a few months in Rio de Janeiro, but I should like to express my country's appreciation of the efforts already made by the Committee preparing for this important meeting. We hope that the results of what has already been termed \\\"the summit of the planet Earth\\\" will meet the great expectations that our planet will be safeguarded and that the main concerns of the developing countries will be duly taken into account.\nAt a time when we can glimpse on the horizon the prospects of a peaceful world rid of the engines of mass destruction, my country hopes that thousands of human beings threatened by famine, poverty and sickness will begin to have some hope that this world of peace will also be theirs - that is, that we shall have a world of active solidarity. It is world peace which is at stake. This is perhaps the greatest challenge faced by our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is indeed a pleasure for me to associate myself with previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute not only to you but also to your great country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose role in world affairs is crucial, especially in the region from which you hall. Your assumption of office comes at a time when our Organisation is poised to gain a greater say in the management of world affairs. I should like at the outset to say that my country subscribes unreservedly to the view that the United Nations should assume broader responsibilities in global governance and must be given the financial, legal and political means to do so. We are confident that with your long political experience and extensive diplomatic skills you will provide welcome guidance and leadership to our deliberations in a period of global changes, which, however, remain fraught with uncertainties.\nYour predecessor, Mr. de Marco of the island State of Malta, deserves out unreserved admiration and appreciation for the effective and wise manner in which he steered the United Nations General Assembly through a trying period. His contribution towards the strengthening of the Organization is highly commendable. During his term of office his initiatives in bringing the process of revitalization of the economic sector of the Organization to the forefront created a timely momentum for reform in an era when the United Nations is enjoying regained prestige.\nI should also like to extend our warmest welcome and felicitations to the Governments and peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on their accession to membership of the United Nations.\nPermit me here to say a special word in respect of the two Koreas The path to the seats they proudly occupy in this family of Nations has been long, arduous and. often trying but they have found it possible to look far beyond and to set in accordance with the changing pattern of the times. Let me formulate the fervent wish of my Government and of the people of Mauritius to see them united, in the not too distant future, in accordance with the wish of their peoples.\nIf our Organisation is held in renewed respect today, it is In great part due to the ceaseless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who, during the final tense years of the cold-war era, managed to keep vital channels of communication open in many areas of conflict and confrontation. As Mr. Peres de Cuellar arrives at the end of his second term we wish to tell him how grateful we all are for the excellent manner in which he has discharged his not always gratifying duties during his term of office. We wish him well in his future endeavours.\nAs we become engaged in the task of selecting the right man to step to the helm of the Organisation, it would perhaps be proper to remind ourselves that ours is a new era and that the first few steps therein have already been taken. The new Secretary-General will therefore have to tackle a different agenda and face new challenges as we move closer to the twenty-first century. At a time when one of the major concerns of mankind is to bridge the gap between the rich North and the poor South, it is fitting that the new Secretary-General should be a personality of the South and indeed from the African continent. It would perhaps have been more judicious for our continent to present one candidate but let us say that the multitude of candidates it has presented is an indication of the winds of change that have of late been blowing across the world. Be that as it may, the Organization deserves the best, for the challenges ahead are daunting and will require from our choice an elevated degree of excellence.\nThe attributes of the Secretary-General will require our attention. In effect, the present international context should enable the Secretary-General to assume greater autonomy and authority on any matter which may constitute a threat to the maintenance of International peace and security. We should be allowed to play a more active role in crisis-monitoring and preventive diplomacy, with the support and cooperation of the Security Council in accordance with Article 99 of the Charter, and thus enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in dealing with international security problems and threats to peace, whether by mediation, enforcement measures or peace-keeping operations.\nAt the same time, judicious action is required to set in motion a reform programme for the Organization. Besides the support which the reform should provide for the expanding nature of the Secretariat's activities, the changes should also be such as to satisfy the aspirations of all Member States and be representative of their interests, particularly at the level of the Security Council.\nThe changing pattern of our times demands that such a reform be undertaken to consolidate the essential role of the United Nations in international issues, in the same way as the Non-Aligned Movement is readjusting itself to better address the challenges that face the world today. Its importance is crucial. Foremost among those challenges, in the view of my delegation, is the one issue on which global peace and security hinge - disarmament - an issue which, until very recently, some had the tendency to relegate to a lesser priority. However, like others who have preceded me in this Assembly, I hold the view that disarmament should continue to occupy the forefront of our concerns and not be pushed to a back-seat position. Disarmament is not an easy objective, but it is one that demands re-invigorated attention, one that calls for new thinking and fresh initiatives, like indeed those we have had the immense pleasure in witnessing these past few days.\nHere I would like to pay special tribute to the Plan of Action proposed by the late and sorely missed Rajiv Gandhi to the Third United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in June 1988, advocating a calendar of actions that would have culminated in the elimination of all nuclear weapons in 22 years from then, that is, effectively in the year 2010.\nI should also like to recall the fillip given to the process of disarmament by President Mitterrand last June, when he rightly stressed in his plan for global disarmament the need for new thinking regarding the nuclear-weapons board in response to the events overrunning the world. His call then for the formulation of new rules to guarantee global security should not be left unheeded.\nAnd then, in these last few days, this issue has been given a breath of fresh air by the courageous and highly commendable announcement by President Bush. His initiatives to reduce the nuclear weaponry of the United States are built on a new defence strategy that, as he himself put it, shifts the focus of the United States away from the prospect of global confrontation. No sooner had this significant and most positive stride been made than it was matched by an equally formidable announcement, made by President Gorbachev last week-end, which clearly demonstrated that a turning-point in the peace process had been reached. With this good news for the whole world, as President Bush put it, we fervently hope that is the days to come further events will confirm that a disarmament race is now on. These announcements, coming so soon after the recent historic, although limited, START agreement has indeed rekindled the flame of hope in one and all, and this is why we insist that the disarmament issue should continue to occupy a prominent place on our agenda.\nMore than anything else, three recent events this year had helped to strengthen my conviction in this regard even before President Bush and President Gorbachev had made their initiatives known to the world.\nFirstly, never since the Second World War has the threat of regional nuclear conflagration been so much in the realm of reality as during the Gulf war. At that time, we learned in a very matter-of-fact manner that nuclear warheads from cruise missiles that had been off-loaded at Clark air base in the Philippines had to be shipped out through Subic Bay naval base in all urgency as Mount Pinatubo erupted violently, and not only sounded the death-knell for the air base, but also made a nuclear accident more than a remote possibility.\nAnd, even more recently, during the unfurling of the dramatic and tense events in the Soviet Union, when a group of ill-advised persons tried to halt and indeed reverse the march of history, doubt was expressed as to whether control over the Soviet nuclear weaponry was still in the rightful hands. International peace and stability appeared to rest with a group of adventurers, as President Gorbachev and President Yeltsin of Russia termed the perpetrators of the failed coup attempt in the Soviet Union. \nClearly, the world needs to be reassured that it can lead its God-given life fully and not be held to ransom by possible man-made disasters. And that is why, while we welcome most heartily President Mitterrand's call for a meeting of the four nuclear Powers that have a presence in Europe, we believe it is equally important that the nuclear arms reduction talks should involve, as soon as possible, all five permanent members of the Security Council, and that they fix as their goal complete nuclear disarmament. That goal is indeed already provided for in the preambles to both the 1963 partial test ban Treaty and the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nIn the same breath, let us commit ourselves not to take the nuclear arms race into outer space. Already, we shudder at the mere thought of so many nuclear warheads dispersed across our planet. Let us therefore contain ourselves and not export into space what we pride ourselves in calling our mastery of scientific technology, but which can as well be described as our propensity to self-destruction.\nWhile on the subject of disarmament, may I refer again to that most important pillar of the present nuclear non-proliferation regime, the NPT, which will come up for renewal in 1995. My delegation takes great satisfaction in the knowledge that at long last both France and China have declared their intention to accede to the Treaty, and we commend them for this commitment, the more so as France stated in this very forum only a few days ago that it will deposit the necessary instrument of adhesion before this year is out. \nHearer Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia have already acceded to the Treaty. But then, our concerns over the loopholes in the Treaty have been further accentuated by the evidence brought to light recently in Iraq, confirming the fact that certain countries continue to contravene their treaty and safeguards obligations in order to embark on a hidden agenda of nuclear activities. My appeal is that we should all strive hard to plug all loopholes and to give the Treaty the non-discriminatory universality it calls for. To that end, the Assembly will recall that Mauritius has proposed, together with Egypt, an informal dialogue between the States parties and the States not parties to the NPT before it comes up for renewal in 1995. He should, however, like to appeal urgently to set the ball in motion as of now. He cannot afford to waste any time.\nImpassioned as we are with the objective of complete nuclear disarmament, my country, Mauritius, has also proposed a South-West Indian Ocean and Southern Africa Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty along the lines of the 1985 South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. Already, we have obtained the full support of some of the countries directly involved in the area identified, among which I should like to mention Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Seychelles and the Comoros. Mauritius looks forward to discussing this proposal soon with post-apartheid South Africa. While the declaration of nuclear-free-zones per se is no universal panacea to the ills that are engendered by nuclear weapons, it is our firm belief that such momentum in the creation of these zones around the world, for example, in the Middle East, in our region and in the Korean peninsula, is conducive to global security, which remains our ultimate goal.\nAs regards chemical weapons, my delegation supports the views already expressed here to the effect that every effort should be undertaken to meet the target data of 1992 for the completion of a comprehensive chemical weapons treaty. In this context, I should like to endorse Australia's proposal for a meeting of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament at the ministerial level so as to resolve outstanding Issues and provide the impetus required for the negotiations.\nI should also like to welcome the positive conclusions reached a few days ago in Geneva at the Third Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention. Such conclusive actions augur well for the future.\nFinally, one last item on this issue that calls for our attention is the stockpiling and production of conventional weapons. Mauritius endorses the call for a register of sales of arms to be kept at the United Nations.\nWhile we also subscribe to the call that the developing countries should reduce military budgets as appropriate, it is equally my strong view that the major arms-producing and developed countries should restrain their weapons production and likewise reduce their military spending. The peace dividend will increase and, on both counts, it will mean a release of funds and resources that can thus be channelled towards the economic and social well-being of those in need around the world.\nSecondly, the new order should address the problem of the economic and social development of all countries. It therefore becomes Imperative to address the glaringly visible gap between the North and the South, reflecting affluence on one hand and abject poverty and deprivation on the other.\nA fundamental goal of the United Nations is to bring about the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Its efforts in that regard were long encumbered by the cold war, which more often than not fanned the flames of war in various regions. The conflicts in those regions made it attractive for massive quantities of sophisticated weapons to be transferred, by all camps, to fragile States and areas of tension in the third world. Arms transfers became lucrative business for the developed countries which have the technology and resources to produce weapons. The readiness of the developed countries to provide developing countries with armaments contrasts very sharply with their response to similar requests for the transfer of financial resources and technology for the purpose of development. It is our hope that, in the light of recent developments, that trend will be reversed and that our appeals for economic transformation will be responded to with vigour and imagination.\nMany speakers have supported the proposal for a register of international transfers of conventional weapons. That proposal is appealing. In our view, for such a register to be meaningful it must be balanced and transparent. It must also cover the producer countries and provide a country-by-country inventory of all armaments produced, stockpiled or transferred. Furthermore, transparency should encompass information on state-of-the-art technology in the military field, as this would engender confidence and alleviate the fear of surprises. It should also be possible to set up an inspection mechanism for verification of such a register.\nI need not repeat that my country's concerns for the preservation of the environment encompass the absolute necessity of ensuring that nothing is done that will continue to bring about the ecological deterioration of our coastal areas and our oceans, which provide a means of livelihood to millions of people across the world. Indeed, we should show no mercy to those who irresponsibly and deliberately pollute our planet on land, at sea or in space.\nWe have witnessed that collective action in many fields bears positive results, no matter how tough the problems may appear. Similarly, on the economic front, it is my country's firm belief that concerted action between the North and the South is imperative if the developing South can ever aspire to emerge from the economic morass in which it has been struggling for ever so long. For let us not forget that economic stability is also a fundamental prerequisite of global security. The debt-ridden countries need to be given more than a breathing space. Yet again, some new thinking will have to go into how best to bridge the gap between the rich North and the poor South.\nWhen one talks of debt, the main focus of attention automatically turns to Africa. The plight of millions of our brothers and sisters on that continent can be described as one of gloom if not yet of doom. The breakthrough in food production that was expected during the 1980s has eluded Africa. Population has continued to grow despite some courageous attempts at initiating population control programmes and at sensitizing African public opinion to the burden an unbridled population growth imposes on the economy. The United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has not lived up to expectations. The 1980s have indeed been a lost decade for Africa. \nWhat then needs to be done? Or, to look at it from another angle, has everything that needs to be done been done? Is it sufficient for us to participate in conferences and seminars and go back home happy to have made a resounding speech or indeed content with the fact that we have placed the blame for our problems squarely at the feet of others? Indeed no. Our intentions and pronouncements need to be translated into concrete action. We owe it to future generations to leave behind a world free from want, a world free from disease, a world where peace, liberty, social justice and economic well-being will be the basic ingredients of life.\nI believe that it is within our grasp to achieve this kind of world. All we need to do is to look to ourselves and start by taking the bold steps that the circumstances dictate. While the rich North should act beyond its present commitment to alleviate the burden of the South, the developing countries should start by cleaning their doorsteps and putting their houses in order. Economic waste and corruption need to be eradicated. Debtor States need to have the courage to implement economic reforms and to strive for the most efficient management of their resources. My country believes that, in this respect as well, the United Nations can play a fundamental role in harnessing all the ideas and possibilities that abound for improving the situation.\nOn the political front, the innovative operations pioneered over a year ago during the elections in Namibia have set the pace for United Nations involvement in other parts of the globe. The United Nations has made positive contributions, particularly in Central America, Afghanistan and Cambodia. It is now engaged in preparing a referendum in Western Sahara, where Mauritius, along with other Member States, is honoured to have been given the opportunity to serve the cause of peace and democracy. Mauritius will not hesitate to condemn any attempt to forestall the implementation of the United Rations plan of action for Western Sahara.\nTalking of democracy brings me to the fact that we in Mauritius, less than a month ago, went to the polls for the fifth time since our independence in 1968. If I venture to mention this here, it is to emphasize how we in Mauritius are firm believers in the process of democracy, a system the shortcomings of which are negligible in the face of the multifarious advantages it brings to the people in the conduct of State affairs and indeed in the economic well-being of our nation globally. We are staunch proponents of the philosophy that there is no meaningful and fruitful development without democracy. And I would like to make so bold as to appeal to those of our sister nations which are still hesitant about the democratic adventure not to resist the thrust of history but rather to give it a try and enjoy its thrills. The system has worked marvellously well in my country and elsewhere. There is no reason why it should not bear the same fruits universally. With it comes the added dividend of peace.\nThe end of the cold war has created new opportunities for the resolution of conflicts in which the United Nations will be associated in one way or another. We are pleased to see that Cambodia has resumed its seat in the General Assembly and that one of the long-standing regional conflicts may soon, we hope, be resolved under the aegis of the United Nations.\nWith this trend of successes, it is but highly desirable that our Organization be allowed to play its rightful role in the Middle East peace process. I have no doubt in my mind that the United Nations will play a catalytic role in bringing about a just and peaceful solution to the area and thus, on the one hand, alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people, and on the other resolve the security problems of the region. I must commend here the untiring and ceaseless efforts being deployed by the United States to bring all parties concerned to the conference table. The position of Mauritius is very clear. We recognize the right of Israel to exist within secure boundaries just as we uphold the struggle of the Palestinians for a State of their own. In this regard we have noted with satisfaction the decision of the Palestinian National Council for effective Palestinian participation in the peace process. Genuine Palestinian representation in this process cannot but be conclusive. In keeping with the evolution of the situation, Mauritius is prepared to go along with a move to rescind resolution 3379 (XXX) equating Zionism with racism on the strict understanding that the Palestinian people's right to statehood be recognized and that Arab lands are not \\\"up for grabs\\\" in the name of any expansionist ideology. It will indeed be to the credit of the leaders of the region to sit at the conference table alongside the other interested parties and the United Nations and to remove from the international agenda the major remaining area of tension and conflict.\nSimilarly, my delegation will continue to support all moves by our Organization aimed at finding an equitable solution to the Cyprus issue in strict respect of its sovereignty. The issue o\u00a3 sovereignty brings me to the fact that Mauritius is itself still struggling to regain its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, a cause which I believe should be supported by the Assembly in its entirety, considering the stand taken by the world community in the recent Gulf Crisis on, precisely, an issue of sovereignty. With the advent of the new era to which I have already referred, it should be possible for the past colonial Power to come to terms with the present situation and acknowledge the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago. It is also the fervent wish of my Government that nothing should be done by any party concerned to aggravate this issue any further, especially as concerns the extension of territorial waters.\nAt the same time, let me reiterate the faith of my Government in the efforts being made by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean for the convening of a United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. In this respect my delegation would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the selfless dedication and untiring determination of the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka. The prominent role played by this sister-island State in such a laudable venture is all the more appreciated considering that it is itself caught in an unfortunate web of violence which continues to take its toll of human lives in the conflict involving the Tamil minority. My Government hopes that a peaceful political solution to the problem will be found very soon.\nNearer us, in South Africa, Mauritius welcomes the recent peace accord signed by the De Klerk Government, the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), Inkatha and others to curb violence in the country. In effect we see this move as a major step forward towards an end to the ongoing violence thereby creating the right conditions for the ultimate eradication of apartheid. Mauritius expects President de Klerk to do everything possible to stop this violence and ensure the impartiality of the security forces\nI should like to stress that the major event we in Mauritius expect to take place shortly in South Africa is the multiparty Conference which will pave the way for a post-apartheid constitution. Mauritius will establish full diplomatic relations with South Africa once a post-apartheid constitution will have been adopted, and we believe that this should be sooner rather than later.\nBut is it not a paradox that at a time when apartheid is being dismantled at one end of the world, a constitution with racist attributes unfortunately continues to prevail in Fiji? Mauritius has no intention to interfere in the internal affairs of any State and it is not in our habit to do so. However, at the risk of sounding self-praising, let me say that Mauritius is a multiracial country where everyone has his rightful place under the sun and where everyone enjoys his civic rights indiscriminately. This harmony works wonders for our prosperity. We believe the same could be achieved in Fiji and we would therefore like to appeal to our brothers there to redress the situation by amending the present Constitution as required and in a manner that would no longer warrant the boycott by any political force of general elections. Fiji, this otherwise gem of an island in the Pacific, owes it to itself and to its image to rectify its path and make it possible for us to welcome Fiji anew and with open arms in such forums as the Commonwealth.\nThere still remain, across the world, quite a few pockets of tension and conflicts. It is the hope of Mauritius that peace will be brought to bear in such places as Mozambique, with which Mauritius so proudly has blood relations, and the countries in the Horn of Africa, so that resources, both human and material, could be fully geared towards their economic advancement.\nI cannot close this chapter without adding the voice of Mauritius to those who have condemned in the strongest possible terms, the coup d'etat perpetrated by the army in Haiti and appealing to those responsible to restore the country to its legitimate rulers.\nIn all the political issues I have just mentioned, an active role can be perceived for the United Nations. Some would dispute such a view but since our Organization is being called upon to assume greater importance in a changing international environment and an increasingly interdependent world, the extent of its new role should be reassessed, inasmuch as we are prepared to challenge the established doctrines of power politics - which have dictated so far how global affairs were regulated - and consider a more appropriate framework for relations among nations.\nRecent events in the Gulf have demonstrated that the United Nations remains the optimal recourse for restoring stability and peace. If indeed the end of the Cold War has brought about new identity of views and interests between major Powers, thus removing the greatest obstacles to global cooperation, then the ability of the United Nations to promote peace and security through collective measures should be strengthened.\nThe stage has been set for such a course of action to be taken. I believe that time is of the essence and we should act accordingly.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI offer my warm congratulations to Ambassador Samir Shlhabi and to his country, Saudi Arabia, on his election to the office of President of the General Assembly. We are pleased that his experience and skill will guide our deliberations at this session as the United Nations enters a particularly crucial stage in its history.\nI should like also to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, whose statesmanship and wise leadership have guided the United Nations over the past tumultuous decade.\nAt this session we welcome seven new Members to the United Nations: the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have, after more than 50 years, regained their sovereignty and independence. We in Ireland have sympathy and admiration for the courage they have shown in seeking, by peaceful means, the realization of their aspirations. We are happy that these efforts have borne fruit.\nA year ago, as the crisis mounted in the Gulf, many of us who spoke from this rostrum wondered if the United Nations had the capacity and the will to meet the challenge. We feared that the things that had hampered the Organization in the past and prevented it from making and keeping peace might do so again; that the new determination to make the United Nations work, and the spirit of cooperation evident in recent years, might break under the strain of conflict. It did not happen. The will of the international\ncommunity prevailed over one State's aggressive and expansionist ambitions. The price was tragically high in bloodshed and lives shattered. One lesson is clear. A united international community acting on the precepts in the Charter can overcome acts of aggression. But there is another conclusion and a more fundamental challenge: to eliminate the causes of conflict, to build confidence, to prevent aggression; to avoid the dreadful parades whereby lives are lost in the pursuit of peace.\nTwelve months later we can say that our Organization is in a stronger position to take up this task. He can hope and work for a system of collective security that will protect the weak against the strong, for a system of law and justice and order between nations. That this is possible is due in the first place to the end of the cold war. For all of us who welcomed the end of the wasted and dangerous years of East-West confrontation and the potential this offered for international cooperation, the attempted coup in the Soviet Union presented a grave threat. It put at risk not only the future of democracy and human rights in that country but our hopes for a new era of international solidarity. Thankfully, the effort was unsuccessful. He salute the determination of the people of Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities throughout the Soviet Union to defend, with their lives if necessary, their new liberties and their hopes for the future. I believe, too, that the international community, by calling for the restoration of legality and by affording moral support and encouragement to those who opposed the coup, also contributed to its defeat. I wish the peoples of the Soviet Union well in their efforts to evolve new political and economic structures founded on the Charter of Paris, including democracy based on respect for human rights, the rule of law and social justice. They have asked for our support and our help. We must respond.\nWe are at the beginning of a new era in international life. The building together of a better future is more clearly before our eyes than at any time in the history of the United Nations. We know what we want to achieve. Our objectives are there In the Charter agreed almost half a century ago - to end war, to protect the dignity and worth of the individual, to ensure freedom and the rule of law, and to promote economic development. Simple and clear precepts. How can we give them effect?\nFirst, we must harness the new mood and dynamism in international life and bring it to bear on the great global challenges facing mankind: disarmament, human rights, the environment, development. These, too, are essential for international peace and security. They are areas in which all of us have a vital interest and where none can act alone.\nSecondly, we must ensure that the fullest use is made of the peace-making and peace-keeping potential of the United Nations to resolve regional conflicts. We have seen what can be done in Angola, Cambodia, Namibia and Western Sahara. Our successes and experience there should encourage us to persevere elsewhere.\nThirdly, we must make this Organization more responsive and more efficient in its working. What the Secretary-General, in his eloquent report, describes as the renaissance of the United Nations must be consolidated. We should now begin a process of analysis and consultation designed to ensure that the United Nations system as a whole functions with maximum efficiency. Without respect for human rights other achievements can hold little value. The starting point of all political activity has to be the recognition of the dignity and worth of each individual human being. It is on this that true freedom and democracy rest. He have seen in Eastern Europe and elsewhere how indomitable the human spirit can be and how irresistible is the pressure for change when a whole people acting in solidarity with each other demand an end to the needless sacrifice of individual human lives to a State system or a political ideology.\nThe growing willingness to use legitimate pressure at the international level to protect and promote human rights is based in the first instance on a concern for the victims. But it is also a matter of common interest to all nations. We are coming to appreciate that wherever there is tyranny, it is impossible to conduct international relations in a spirit of openness, confidence, and trust.\nHuman rights are indivisible. To be a victim of hunger, illness, illiteracy is to be deprived of basic economic and social rights. In recent times we have become more aware, I believe, of the link between respect for human rights and economic development, which flourishes best in a context of individual creativity, responsible government and social justice. Repression is no recipe for economic and social progress.\nThe realization by many of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe of their aspirations to freedom and democracy has brought to the fore the question of how in turn the aspirations of minorities are to be addressed. This is a complex question to which there are no simple answers. Clearly, there is a duty incumbent on Governments to ensure that members of minorities can enjoy in full the basic human rights common to all. Where special protection is needed it should be forthcoming. But beyond this, there is an urgent need for the international community to work out principles to serve as a framework within which conflicting aspirations can be resolved peacefully and through negotiation.\nIreland welcomes the opportunity to review developments in the field of human rights at the World Conference in 1993. An essential foundation for further progress is that the major human rights instruments should be accepted and implemented by all States.\nNo issue more clearly illustrates our mutual interdependence than the environment. We have a shared responsibility for the ecosystem on which life on this planet depends. The agenda here is truly daunting. We must promote sustainable development based on equal partnership with developing countries. We must tackle the issue of climate change. We must protect our natural resources, such as forests and water. These issues are highly technical, but their resolution will require political leadership of the highest order.\nIreland, with its partners in the European Community, is determined to make the fullest contribution to next year's United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil - the Earth Summit. We are glad that as part of the preparations, Dublin will be the site for an international Conference on Water and the Environment to take place next January.\nI know that some developing countries are concerned that recent events in international life, in particular the war in the Gulf and the revolutions in Eastern Europe, could turn our attention away from the challenge of development. But development is essential to peace and security and requires our dedicated efforts. We must give priority to the alleviation of poverty, to the elimination of famine, to equitable economic relations, to the relationship between the environment and development, and to the problems of indebtedness.\nNext year's eighth Conference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will give the international community a valuable opportunity to form an over-all picture of the global economic situation. Ireland believes that the approach must be comprehensive and based on consensus. UNCTAD provides a forum for the achievement of these aims.\nIn the meantime, we look to an early and balanced agreement within the Uruguay Round.\nThe 12 member States of the European Community will submit proposals at this session of the General Assembly aimed at strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to respond with emergency assistance to situations of the kind we have seen, for example, in the wake of flooding or drought. We see this as part of the wider effort to empower and update the United Nations.\nEvents in the past year have again underlined the urgent need for progress in disarmament and arms control. We are fortunate that with necessity goes opportunity. As divisions end in Europe, and in the aftermath of the Gulf War, the outlook is more promising.\nThe signature by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and the recent announcements by France and China of their intention to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the accessions to it of South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, greatly strengthen the international regime of nuclear non-proliferation.\nThe recent undertakings given by several countries to abolish their chemical weapons stocks are welcome. They will encourage developments in the field of conventional arms control and will underpin the belief that there is a new political will to achieve progress in disarmament. My Government believes that fresh and more urgent consideration should be given to the proposal, which Ireland has long supported, for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We hope there will be widespread support from Member States of all regions for the proposal to establish a United Nations arms register, which the 12 member States of the European Community are presenting at this year's session.\nHuman rights, the environment, development and disarmament are some of the areas in which, designing on a broad canvas, we hope to foster a world order more accountable to reason and more responsive to considerations of justice. There are also many specific situations in which we must try to bring to bear the spirit and experience of the United Nations.\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict involves two great historical traditions - noble peoples that have been blown before the winds of history. It is hard to imagine any single development that would be more welcome to the international community than a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. The end of the Gulf War has given a strong impulse to the search for a settlement. Ireland supports the dedicated efforts of United States Secretary of State James Baker. As a member of the European Community, we will actively contribute to the success of the peace conference.\nWe want to see full respect for the human rights of the Palestinian people and an improvement in their economic and social conditions. The establishment of settlements in the occupied territories is illegal and must be ended. For the first time in 15 years there is hope of progress in Lebanon. We rejoice at the recent release of hostages and renew our appeal for the immediate release of those still bald captive.\nIn Iraq, we expect the authorities to respect fully and to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. They must not obstruct the efforts of the United Rations teams to carry out the mandate given to them by the international community.\nIn South Africa, the apartheid system is an affront to reason and human dignity. The removal of the legislative pillars of the system has opened the way for substantive negotiations on a new constitutional order. These important measures must be followed by the elimination in practice of all racial discrimination and by an improvement of the position of the disinherited. It is now for the parties to bring about the context in which negotiations will have the best prospects for success. Among other factors it will be important for all parties to implement in full the national peace accord signed on 14 September. I look forward to the day when a new, democratic, united and non-racial South Africa plays its full part on the stage of African and world affairs.\nThe United Nations plan for peace in Cambodia offers the best guarantee of a just, durable and comprehensive settlement of that conflict. The ultimate goal must be to ensure for the Cambodian people a future in which they enjoy true peace and security, free from any threat of a return to past policies and practices and above all of the genocide which has outraged the conscience of mankind.\nWe welcome the admission of both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations as well as the reopening of direct political dialogue between North Korea and South Korea. I urge North Korea to implement all Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations without delay, notably the International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards Agreement.\nThe past year has seen significant developments in Central America, not least because of the invaluable role played by the Secretary-General. There are now excellent prospects for an end to armed conflict in El Salvador and Guatemala. The day is approaching when all the countries of Central America will be able to focus their political energies on the strengthening of democracy and of economic and social progress, in a context of increasing regional cooperation and full respect for human rights.\nFor some months the European Community and its member States have sought a peaceful and lasting solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia which would protect the rights of all in Yugoslavia and take full account of their legitimate concerns and aspirations. To this end the Community has negotiated cease-fires in Slovenia and Croatia and has dispatched a monitor mission to oversee their implementation. Host recently the European Community has convened a peace conference under the chairmanship of Lord Peter Carrington with the participation of the Yugoslav parties. Ireland has fully supported these moves and is participating in the monitor mission.\nOur involvement in the European Community's efforts underlines our long-standing commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflict and our readiness to assist, in ways that are open to us, in reaching a peaceful solution of crises in the international arena.\nWith its partners in the European Community and other Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) participating States, Ireland is willing to look at additional steps that might be taken in concert with the parties to the Yugoslav conflict to create a stable background to the peace conference. We welcome in particular the measures adopted on Wednesday by the Security Council which give the backing and authority of this world Organization to the effort we are making to resolve this dangerous and complex conflict.\nIn his report the Secretary-General has said that never before have so many new insights been gained about the varied tasks of keeping, making or building the peace in areas given or threatened by conflict. The experiences in Namibia, in Haiti, and in Central America, as well as the new operations in the Western Sahara and Angola, would have been beyond the reach of the United Nations in any other era. Of the 22 United Nations peace-keeping operations launched since its inception, almost half have been established in the past three years.\nSince Ireland's first involvement, in 1958, it has contributed over 33,000 personnel to United Nations service. Our soldiers currently serve in nine operations and our civilian police are preparing for service in two of them. We believe that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon still has a vital contribution to make to stability in South Lebanon.\nLast year I said that proper funding of United Nations peace-keeping operations was essential. That is a point widely understood and accepted. Let us find a solution and ensure that it is no longer an issue of contention among us.\nIn our approach to the problem of Northern Ireland we seek the peaceful and voluntary reconciliation of two conflicting traditions. It follows that we are opposed, as a matter of fundamental principle, to all recourse to violence, and we will continue to use all the resources at our disposal to counter the efforts of those who resort to it. Such methods are deeply undemocratic and morally repugnant. They cannot succeed because they are based on the mistaken assumption that a solution can be found through coercion. The aim of the Irish Government is rather to build on what unites both traditions in Ireland and on the shared interest of the Irish and British peoples to bring peace and reconciliation. In this it has the support of the vast majority of the Irish people.\nIt is common ground between the Irish and British Governments that a solution must be based on the totality of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South in the island of Ireland, and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. The Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed in 1985, was a development, of this approach. Since coming into force it has provided a valuable mechanism of cooperation between the two Governments on a wide range of issues relating to Northern Ireland. These include the eradication of discrimination in whatever guise it may exist, but particularly in employment practices; even-handedness in the behaviour of the security forces and in the administration of justice; respect for human rights and the rule of law; and equality of esteem and treatment for both traditions.\nWe attach importance also to the role of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the economic and social sectors. It has enhanced cross-border cooperation in these areas in recent years. Overall, progress has been made, even if much still remains to be achieved. He will continue to utilize fully the structures of the Agreement to this end in the period ahead.\nThe Anglo-Irish Agreement has been of particular value in identifying common elements in the approach of both Governments to Northern Ireland and in formalizing cooperation between them. These achievements must be preserved. However, the Unionist community in Northern Ireland has continued to reject the Agreement which it sees as a threat to its interests. Our concern now is to promote a political dialogue which will involve it as well as the two Governments and all those political parties in Northern Ireland which are committed to progress exclusively through political means. We have made clear that we are willing to work for a new agreement which would give full expression to all of the relationships of which I have spoken and which would therefore transcend the existing Agreement.\nDuring the past year, tentative steps were taken towards getting such a dialogue under way. Last March the two Governments and the elected leaders of democratic parties in Northern Ireland agreed on a sat of negotiating structures corresponding to the three critical relationships. In the event the opportunity eluded us. There was soma progress. But despite all efforts to offer reassurance, the mistrust which for so long has corroded relationships on our island once again prevailed.\nThere is now a general concern, which we fully share, that whatever fragile progress was made in recent months should be preserved. For its part, the Irish Government is determined to seek to move forward as imaginatively as possible in the period ahead, and we are ready, if necessary, to envisage new avenues of approach. Our openness is conditioned only by the requirement that the common objective must be not to undermine what has been achieved but to build a durable settlement. He do not underestimate the complexities but we believe that the search for a solution must be sustained. There can be false pessimism no less than false optimism.\nThere are, I believe, factors at work for progress. The strong tide of public support in both communities for the process of dialogue is a sign of hope. The relationship between the Irish and British Governments, always a critical factor, is one of increasing cooperation and commitment to address this difficult remaining legacy of our common past.\nThe European Community provides a positive, wider context. It is at once a model of how ancient enmities can be overcome and a practical arrangement which will progressively diminish the impact of political borders within its ambit. Elsewhere in Europe, far-reaching attempts are under way to confront other historical legacies of great complexity. The prevalent mood of change must encourage those in Ireland who wish to escape from the entrenched attitudes of the past and who seek, as we do, a transformation of relationships which will bring lasting peace.\nThe Foreign Minister of the Netherlands has already spoken in the name of the 12 member States of the European Community of the major challenges confronting our world today. I fully endorse his statement. It is his earnest hope - and my earnest hope - that this Assembly can move forward in unison, casting aside the division and recrimination of yesteryear. As President Roosevelt so eloquently said in March 1945, the United Nations:\n\\\"Ought to spell the end of the system of unilateral action, the power and exclusive alliances, the spheres of influence, the balances of power and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries - and have always failed.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. Apart from being a tribute to you personally, to your diplomatic talent and your sense of reason, your election honours the representative of a country whose prominent role and place in the Arab world and on the international scene are known to all.\nMay I also express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, whose indefatigable energy in the service of peace has given so many peoples grounds for hope, and which will have made its mark on our time.\nThe Organisation is welcoming seven new Members. This is a momentous event, one which is cause for celebration. Welcome to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Their return to our midst redresses an injustice that had no equal and effaces the criminal act committed against these peoples.\nWelcome to the great Korean people, heir to an ancient and distinguished civilisation, who come to the Organization through the separate admission of two States. We hope that they will thus find occasion for friendly dialogue, which will enable them to recover the unity to which they aspire.\nWelcome to the Marshall Islands and to Micronesia. These two States will bring to the Organization the benefits of the ancient wisdom of the Pacific Islands.\nThe years 1989 and 1990 rang with the sounds of liberation - moments of historic happiness rarely encountered - and 1991 has seen the movement continue and amplify.\nHistory has suddenly accelerated. A real revolution has radically altered our points of reference and swept away old habits. A new world is emerging. It will be based, members can be sure, on freedom, solidarity, security and the rule of law. \nIn the course of the past year, freedom has continued to gain ground. Let us rejoice, for freedom is the sun that shines on our peoples: freedom for Kuwait, which was reinstated to sovereignty and independence - admittedly at the price of the use of force - thanks to the new capacity of the United Nations to further the rule of law; burgeoning freedom in South Africa, where the barriers of apartheid have at last been dismantled - may this impetus not be slowed; and hope of freedom and peace in Cambodia. Speaking from this rostrum in 1988, the President of the French Republic proposed an international conference to help this martyred country regain unity and peace.\n\tIt has taken three years for the realities of the situation to prevail, three years of patient negotiations, three years of persistence; for the inevitability of discord seemed to impinge on the slightest progress. The convening of a conference on Cambodia will at last set the seal on a peace agreement. I should like to pay a tribute to Prince Sihanouk, President of the Supreme National Council, who is sitting in our midst at the head of the Cambodian delegation. His patience and sense of dialogue have once again revealed his qualities as a Head of State capable of reuniting a people and reconciling it with itself. I should like to wish a happy future to the people of Cambodia, whose suffering I shared and whose aspirations I hope to share.\n- Freedom of choice offered to the peoples of Western Sahara through a referendum organised by the United Nations in accordance with the wish of all the parties concerned.\n- Hope in the Middle East. After so many years of conflict and absence of understanding, the prospect of the convening of a peace conference provides the opportunity for a settlement based on law and justice, a comprehensive peace settlement, it should be recalled, which should therefore enshrine the right of all to live in peace within secure and recognized borders, by giving the Palestinians a land and a state. Yes, freedom for the Palestinian people.\n- Freedom for Lebanon, which is dressing its wounds and putting an end to its strife. Let it affirm its sovereignty over the whole of its national territory by the disarmament of militia forces, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), Let it boldly address its task of reconstruction and quickly return to the path of democracy by holding free elections. Those are France's wishes for Lebanon, which is so close to it in heart, in mind and in history.\n- Freedom too for Moscow, where democratic forces have swept away factions which thought they could use violence to impose the return of an order that had been driven from the scene but remains present in our memories, an order that has been overturned and condemned. Let us pay a tribute to those who threw up the barricades of freedom and confronted the threat so that the will of the people could prevail. Hai1 to the defenders of the White House of Moscow.\nIn Kuwait, in the Soviet Union and in the Baltic countries, freedom is gaining ground everywhere and democracy is smiling on peoples. The points marked with a cross on the map of oppression and tutelage are gradually fading, and as they fade the old world order, with its compromises and deadlocks, is disappearing. This transformation is taking place before our very eyes. Let us look directly at it. Hope is replacing threat, dialogue is being set in train beyond all expectations, and the world rings with the sound of statues being toppled.\nBut new clouds are already appearing on the horizon. Will we see those who are gaining their freedom and independence take the path of blind nationalism and make anachronistic territorial claims? Will the clash of interests take the place of ideological confrontations? Roads and struggles of this kind lead nowhere, as experience and history have taught us. Dictatorship, poverty, exodus and war are their end result. To avoid these dangers, we must devise formulas and solutions appropriate for our times. Let us begin by building new solidarities, and use the opportunity to turn towards the future.\nWith regard to building new solidarities, let us first speak of Europe. It is experiencing on its own soil the world's last great phase of decolonisation. I wish to state here that France will be at one with all peoples which choose to make their voice heard on the international scene and which peacefully and democratically express their resolve to accede to independence. For self-determination is indivisible; and it cannot be an object of bargaining. Let us recall a few simple rules that may help these movements to mature in harmony:\nFirst, every people that wants it has the right to self-determination and sovereignty. Secondly, this presupposes a clear definition of the rights of minorities; we should think about the role the United Nations could play in this respect. Thirdly, it is essential to ensure respect for international treaties, and hence recognition of borders. Fourthly, borders may be changed only through dialogue or, failing that, through arbitration. Lastly, good neighbourly relations can be governed by freely accepted agreements.\nWhat France has proposed for Yugoslavia holds true in a general way for everyone.\nLet us spare ourselves a return to empires and opportunistic alliances in the twenty-first century. Let us note our regional complementarities, derive advantage from them and give them a context.\nIs this, after all, not the purpose of the Community construction in Europe so well described just a moment ago by my colleague Mr. Van Den Broek? Why have we spent 40 years building a European Community - first of six, then of nine, and now of 12? Because we were convinced that peace, prosperity and our identity would be established in a lasting manner only through the sharing of our national sovereignties. Those who had doubts must now bow to the evidence. The European Community has become a benchmark for some and for others a source of admiration. The European Community owes it to itself to continue to astonish the world by pursuing its integration, planned for the end of 1991. Strengthened by a Germany at last reunited, the European Economic Community will continue its progress towards unity.\nThe new democracies of central and eastern Europe have understood this necessity of union and cooperation and have turned eagerly and hopefully to the Community. Within the Twelve, France in turn understands this request, this expectation, which it hopes will be answered as soon as possible by preparations for these countries' admission to the European Economic Community. This will of course take time. That is all the more reason to get down to the task right away.\nBut are we to do nothing during this period, leaving these democracies, which are so close to us, uncertain as to their future? Of course not. Europe needs a new pact right now.\nAware of the danger that still threatens it, can our continent - our ancient continent - rally to preserve the gains of the past few years and go forward? This is the essence of the confederation France has proposed. Our aim is to go beyond the logic of aid, which out of necessity has been the reason for most actions so far, in order to arrive at a real political, economic and social community on the continent, in the spirit of the founding fathers of a free Europe in the immediate post-war period.\nIt would be a paradox if just as this Europe - which will become more and more confederal - was taking shape, a parallel but contrary movement towards dismemberment and break-up were to prevail elsewhere. That is why we hope that the republics of the USSR succeed in exercising their new responsibilities and organising their relations as they intend to do, and succeed in defining, at the international level, as reason and the course of events dictate, the expression of their common interests and resolve. We hope they can do so with due respect for the principles and norms of security and stability accepted in Europe.\nYugoslavia, which is being torn apart, represents the other example of a necessary transformation. May the legitimate aspirations for freedom which are being expressed there take into consideration the interests of all. May the rights of minorities be preserved and the advantages of a space shared by ill the peoples of Yugoslavia be maintained and guaranteed. That, it seems to me, is the road to peace and regained prosperity. But none of this will be possible so long as the fighting persists. The conflagration is building and threatens to spread. Time is running out. Yugoslavia is heading deeper into an impasse. France believes it is incumbent on the United Nations to bring the parties to their senses by demanding compliance with the cease-fire, by showing them the way to dialogue and to negotiation that has been mapped out with their consent by the European Community, by saying to all that peace has its requirements, theirs and others'. France, which is the current President of the Security Council, will leave no stone unturned to achieve this end.\nCan I fail to refer to the solidarity between the North and the South? No. The planet is one. Who can believe in a future in which less than one quarter of the world's population enjoys the benefits of progress while the remaining three quarters are abandoned to despair?\nIn the course of the past five years, Africa's gross national product has grown less quickly than its population. Today's 500 million Africans will be 1.5 billion in the year 2025, while the sources of financing are drying up. Net capital input fell in real terms from 1986 to 1990. World Bank and International Monetary Fund transfers are currently negative, with African countries paying back far more than they receive.\nWithout wishing to sound like an oracle, France has consistently spoken of this intolerable and inevitable trend in order to seek a greater effort of solidarity from the rich. My country senses it is being better heeded now, and I hope that is true. It welcomes this especially as another danger is threatening the developing countries: the danger of a society exploding in response to excessive demands.\nIt is appropriate, certainly, to ensure that the assistance to developing countries is well employed. That is the best way to generate official and private resources and to promote regional integration, which is still in its early stages.\nIn this respect, the Treaty for the Constitution of the Common Market of the South - the MERCOSUR Treaty - signed in March 1991, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay in a common market, is a good example of what has to be done. It should not remain an isolated instance. I am thinking it particular of Africa, where plans to set up a large common agricultural market should be pursued. The franc zone, with its single currency, offers a favourable terrain for such a market.\nFrance, together with its European Economic Community partners, intends to support these efforts. It does not intend to render them useless by imposing requirements that go beyond what is reasonable.\nLastly, one cannot speak of solidarity without mentioning the environment. The international community has already held debates on and carried out research into this important subject. It has launched significant concrete programs. France welcomes, for example, the success of the initiative on the decision to protect Antarctica, which it took in 1989 together with Australia, subsequently joined by Italy and Belgium. The Madrid protocol, which will be signed on 4 October 1991, declares Antarctica to be a \\\"natural reserve devoted to peace and science\\\". This responds to the wishes of all those who desire to safeguard our common heritage, our planet. It should inspire other actions.\nI believe that everything I have said is of a conservative nature. Yet the exacerbation of risks and the emergence of new dangers require us to think on a new scale and give free rein to our ambition.\nThus, we warmly welcome the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is to be held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and to which France is lending its assistance and support. That Conference will be preceded by the meeting in Paris at the end of the year, called by the President of the French Republic, which will be attended by all the non-governmental organisations concerned.\nThe efforts to combat desertification, to preserve and harness the resources of the great forests and to protect the ozone layer, biological diversity and the seas and the oceans: these are subjects of pre-eminent interest to all mankind.\n\t\nIt. would be pointless to speak of the future of mankind without referring to security. The end of the cold war provides an exceptional opportunity, so let us seize it by pursuing disarmament world wide. In that sphere my country's policy is consistent with a number of principles that I would like to enumerate briefly.\nThe most important agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe was signed at the Paris summit in 1990. Its ratification can wait no longer. Prance is committed to this and hopes that all the signatories will proceed to ratification, thus making it possible to move on to a new phase in these negotiations.\nFrance duly welcomed the signing in Moscow of the strategic arms reduction Treaty - the START Treaty. The reduction of the strategic arsenals of the United States and the USSR, which will take several years, should be followed by new commitments now. France will join in the negotiations once those arsenals have been reduced to a level warranting our participation, under the terms set forth in this very Hall by the President of the French Republic in 1985.\nFor Europeans, the existence and availability of nuclear armaments raise specific problems which have emerged with the changes in the Soviet Union. France has asked that the four Powers concerned meet as early as possible to examine these problems together.\nOn a more general note, France is in favour of global disarmament. In June 1991 it made public its plan encompassing all aspects of security. It announced its decision to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. My country will submit the instruments of accession before the year's end.\nAlready, we are taking steps to exercise complete control over exports related to nuclear energy. France is in favour of finalising at an early date the convention on the final elimination of chemical weapons. It hopes that the convention will be signed next year. The treaty banning chemical weapons should be accompanied by appropriate means for monitoring compliance, without which its effectiveness will be compromised.  For while treaties prepare the way for security, it is confidence that creates it. There is no real confidence without control. The example of Iraq shows this only too well.\nStrict compliance with accords and monitoring are the keystones of disarmament, and it is, in my view, for the United Nations to promote accession to these treaties, to monitor their implementation and impose penalties, where necessary, when agreements are violated. Let us, therefore, give the United Nations the means to carry out this task.\nMy concluding comments will concern strengthening the role of the United Nations. How can this be accomplished? Our Organisation, which is the universal expression of our solidarity, has done more in these past years than reflect our concerns. It has done more than it had done in past decades. With the backing of its Secretary-General and the determined support of the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United Nations has been a driving force. It has affirmed the law on numerous occasions and enforced compliance where necessary.\nThe United Nations perseverance on behalf of human rights prompted South Africa to move towards abolishing apartheid. The efforts to help restore democracy in Haiti, the part played in the peace process in El Salvador, the Secretary-General's peace plan of 21 May for Afghanistan are all initiatives that have marked for history the growing role of the United Nations.\nBut it is undoubtedly in regard to the Gulf crisis that the progress has been the most spectacular. The main point was to stop aggression and to lay the often innovative foundations for order through law.\nThe United Nations could not remain passive in the face of the tragedy which threatened the very existence of the Kurdish people. For the first time, through a Security Council resolution, the United Nations affirmed that the sufferings of a population justified immediate intervention. My country is proud to have proposed the adoption of resolution 688 (1991).\nYet, as members are aware, none of this could be taken for granted. Today the foundations of a new legal order, a new humanitarian order, have been laid. Why not adopt a code of conduct affirming the right to humanitarian assistance every time the integrity and survival of a people is threatened?\nHowever, we must not lose sight of the fact that the progress that has been made is not sufficient to offset the reversals where these exist. If tomorrow, in the conflict between Israel and the Arab countries, the United Nations were to give up its efforts to require compliance with the principles which have earned it its success, it would quickly lose in credibility what it has earned in prestige. The Organization is too much a grande dame now to tolerate disrespect.\nAt a time when France holds the presidency of the Security Council, it is pleased and proud to contribute to the adoption of two important resolutions, which I hope will be adopted, on Yugoslavia and Cambodia.\nMore than ever before, the values which underlie the principles of our Organization are a benchmark. New States have joined us and others will follow. National minorities are claiming the right to preserve what constitutes their identity and cohesion. What are they doing? They look to the United Nations. Individuals are thirsting for justice. What do they do?\nThey invoke the United Nations moral jurisdiction. Never have democracy and human rights - the former thought by some to have been superseded and the latter considered by others the product of an impoverished mind - constituted such important guidelines for a world urgently seeking peace and prosperity.\nLet us therefore prepare, clearly and with enthusiasm, for the great rendezvous of 1993s the World Conference on Human Rights, which will also be the rendezvous of democracy victorious.\nIt is there that, half a century after the cataclysm that shook the world, and the long night that deprived too many peoples of the light of freedom, our generation will finally be able to say: We have been worthy of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is with great pleasure that I extend to you, my dear brother, the sincere felicitations of the Pakistan delegation on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Your election to this high office is a befitting tribute to the outstanding role played on the world stage by your great country, from where the light of Islam spreads to the entire globe. It is also a recognition of your diplomatic skills and qualities of statesmanship\nthat have won admiration in many parts of the world, and, is particular in the councils of the United nations. We in Pakistan recall with great fondness the time when we had the privilege of having you as the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nPakistan is bound to Saudi Arabia in close brotherly ties which encompass common faith, shared values and common history. We are confident that, with your vast experience and consummate skills, you will successfully guide the deliberations of this important session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like to convey our deep appreciation and esteem to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Foreign Minister of Malta, who conducted the proceedings of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly with great distinction and success.\nI take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his unceasing efforts to promote international peace and harmony and uphold the principles and purposes of the United Rations Charter. He has addressed world problems with a deep sense of purpose. The world community owes him a profound debt of gratitude for his untiring endeavours in strengthening the foundations of peace and security around the world.\nIt is a matter of particular happiness for my delegation to welcome seven States as new Members of the United Nations. The presence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands in our midst is indeed a historic occasion. This is a testimony to the universality and the growing strength of our Organization. On behalf of the Government and people of Pakistan, I would extend our warm congratulations to the delegations of those countries as they assume their membership of the world body.\nThe historic transformation sweeping the globe has generated a blend of sanguine expectations and serious concerns. While the world has witnessed the end of the ideological confrontation between the two super-Powers, heralding\nan era of mutual collaboration and accommodation, it has also experienced a devastating military conflict in the Persian Gulf. The security of small States continues to be threatened and armed conflicts continue to fester in various regions of the world. There is no justification, therefore, for complacency.\nReal peace and progress can be ensured only if States, big and small, abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter, settle their disputes peacefully and advance international cooperation to accelerate the economic progress of the developing countries. The major Powers have a special responsibility to respect and promote the principle of sovereign equality. It would indeed be tragic if the end of the cold war witnessed the birth of another era of international tensions on account of the hegemonic ambitions of major regional Powers. He should work for a new world order based on equity, justice and progress reflecting the collective aspirations of mankind.\nThe United Nations has a central role to play in such a world order by ensuring respect for the principles and purposes of its Charter and the faithful implementation of its resolutions. We espouse a faith which stands for peace and forbids wars of aggression. The Holy Koran says:\n\\\"Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you; but do not begin the hostilities; for Allah does not approve of aggression\\\". (The Holy Koran, II:190)\nPakistan will continue to make its contribution to the promotion of peace and the strengthening of the United Nations in the realization of its objectives.\nPakistan welcomes the relaxation of international tensions, the universal movement towards democracy, the upsurge of economic liberalism, the serious pursuit of arms control and the growing respect for the deep-seated urge of peoples for the exercise of their right to self-determination. These fundamental changes have created a salutary environment for resolving conflicts that still persist as a legacy of the cold war and the colonial period. Unfortunately, Pakistan's own sincere quest for durable peace and stability in South Asia has foundered on the un-constructive attitude adopted by India on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.\nThe people of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir have risen to demand their inalienable right to self-determination - a right solemnly pledged to the Kashmiri people by India, Pakistan and the international community in the various resolutions adopted by the United Nations. It is with a deep sense of anguish that I report to this Assembly that occupied Jammu and Kashmir remains in the throes of a profound human tragedy.\nThe United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan have prescribed in their resolutions that the future of the State of Jammu and Kashmir must be decided in accordance with the will of the people, expressed through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations. I should like to draw attention, in particular, to Security Council resolution 47 (1948), adopted on 21 April 1948, and the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan on 13 August 1948 and 5 January 1949. Both India and Pakistan, as parties to the dispute, are bound by those resolutions, which continue to be valid and operative. The Simla Agreement of 1972 between India and Pakistan categorically acknowledged that Kashmir was an outstanding issue that remained to be settled.\nSince January 1990 the situation in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir has greatly deteriorated. The sufferings of innocent Kashmiri men, women and children at the hands of Indian security forces have increased beyond measure. Even Indian human rights organisations and media have acknowledged the grave human rights violations by Indian forces In the occupied territory. During the last 21 months over 5,000 innocent civilians have been killed. A determined effort is under way to terrorize and suppress the people. Dawn to dusk curfews, house-to-house searches, torture, arbitrary detention and gang rapes of women are daily occurrences in the valley. Despite the deployment of nearly half a million Indian military and paramilitary forces in Kashmir, the indigenous, widespread uprising continues to gather momentum, reflecting the resolve of the people of Kashmir to secure their inalienable right to self-determination. Pakistan cannot remain a silent spectator of the sufferings of the Kashmiri people, a people with which we are linked by unbreakable bonds of religion, history, kinship and culture.\nHuman rights violations do not take place in a vacuum. They stem from failure to find a peaceful solution to political problems. Human rights violations that have occurred in Palestine, South Africa and other parts of the world are a result of the inability of the international community to redress the political problems inherent in these situations. This also applies to Kashmir, where the political problem continues to fester because of the failure of the international community to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe uprising in Indian-occupied Kashmir is entirely indigenous and spontaneous. India's attempts to attribute the turmoil to interference by Pakistan are both self-serving and misleading. As an earnest of our good faith, we had proposed to India the establishment of a neutral mechanism, such as the stationing of impartial international observers, along the Line of\nControl to monitor, survey and investigate the situation and reach independent conclusions. India has not accepted this offer - thus exposing the hollowness of its allegations.\nWhile we rejoice with those who have gained freedom, we cannot ignore the plight of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The international community must exert moral and political pressure on India to desist from the use of force and allow the people of Kashmir to exercise freely their inalienable right to self-determination. It is only through the uniform enforcement of the decisions of the Security Council that faith in the United Nations as an instrument of international peace and security can be preserved. A selective approach to the settlement of disputes would impair the image and stature of the world body.\nPakistan is committed to a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions and in the spirit of the Simla agreement. For that purpose, we have consistently expressed our willingness to engage India in a constructive and meaningful dialogue.\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan sent a special envoy to India in August 1991 conveying the hope that Pakistan and India would settle all bilateral disputes peacefully. It is our conviction that the resolution of the Kashmir issue would pave the way for a new era in which tension and confrontation would be replaced by harmony and cooperation between the two neighbouring countries.\nThe heroic struggle of the Afghan people succeeded in freeing their homeland from foreign occupation. It also contributed to the current resurgence of freedom and democracy in the world. But Afghanistan remains in the grip of a continuing armed conflict. Recent developments in the region have, however, brightened the prospects for a just political settlement. Efforts must now be intensified so that peace can be restored in Afghanistan and so that millions of Afghan refugees can return to their homes in safety and honour. The essential element of any settlement in Afghanistan must necessarily remain the transfer of power from the present dispensation in Kabul to a broad-based government representing the will and aspirations of the Afghan people.\nPakistan has emphatically reiterated its commitment to a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghanistan problem and has embarked on a series of initiatives. He have held extensive consultations with the countries concerned, namely Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States and the Soviet Union.\nWe have also fully supported the efforts of the Secretary-General. Pakistan and Iran have also resolved to work together with the Afghan mujahidin in a trilateral framework to promote the peace process.\nThe Secretary-General's five-point proposal, announced on 21 May 1991, provides a set of guiding principles which could form the basis of a possible settlement in Afghanistan. He favour a package plan of understandings on all the elements of the proposal. While we welcome the recent United States-Soviet decision to terminate weapon supplies to all Afghan parties by 1 January 1992, it is important that the intervening period should be utilized to facilitate agreements on the remaining points, especially on a transition mechanists, which is the heart of the Secretary-General's proposal. Understandings should also be worked out on arrangements for the election of the future Government of Afghanistan, a cease-fire and the return of the Afghan refugees.\nPakistan has been providing shelter and succour to over 3 million Afghan refugees for more than 12 years. They have chosen to face the privations and rigours of exile rather than expose themselves to the insecurity and uncertainties caused by the conflict in their homeland. The recent decline in international humanitarian assistance has not only exacerbated the hardships for the Afghan refugees, but has also put an unusually heavy strain on our already meagre resources. He call upon the international community to continue to fulfil its humanitarian obligations until favourable conditions have been created for the voluntary return of the refugees to their homeland.\nI would like to express our deep appreciation for the ceaseless efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative in the quest for a comprehensive settlement of the Afghan problem. I would also like\nto commend the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the important role he has played in providing relief and assistance for the Afghan refugees.\nThe conflict in the Persian Gulf dealt a grievous blow to the cause of regional peace and cooperation. Pakistan took a principled position on the issue consonant with the relevant Security Council resolutions. At the same time, we made serious efforts for a peaceful and honourable solution of the problem. For that purpose, the Prime Minister of Pakistan undertook visits to 12 Islamic countries and sent special envoys to 13 other countries. The armed conflict extracted a heavy toll in human losses and caused colossal material destruction. Pakistan believes that it is time to put the bitterness of war behind us and open a new chapter of friendship and cooperation.\nPakistan adheres firmly to the belief that there can be no stable peace in the Middle East without the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including Al-Quds A1-Sharif, and the restitution of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, especially their right to establish a State of their own in Palestine.\nThe courageous and valiant uprising of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has demonstrated clearly that a people determined to secure its freedom and independence cannot be held back through repression.\nWe hope that the recent initiatives for the convening of an international peace conference on Palestine, with the participation of the parties concerned, including the Palestinians, would lead to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.\nThe problem of Cyprus remains a matter of concern for all of us. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General to resolve the Cyprus question in accordance with Security Council resolution 649 (1990).\nPakistan has been following with keen interest the initiative of the five permanent members of the Security Council on the issue of Cambodia. He are confident that their efforts, and those of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), will prove fruitful in resolving this issue on the basis of the free exercise of the will of the Cambodian people. He welcome the fact that Cambodia is represented in the General Assembly by the delegation of the Supreme Rational Council headed by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\nRecent developments in South Africa constitute steps in the right direction, but fall short of the complete elimination of apartheid. The international community has an obligation to extend wholehearted support to the struggle of the people of South Africa for self-determination and majority rule. The sanctions imposed against the Pretoria regime should continue to be applied until the complete elimination of apartheid and the establishment of majority rule in South Africa have been achieved.\nThe changed global situation has underscored the importance of regional economic cooperation. Pakistan is resolved to give further depth and substance to regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization.\nPakistan has consistently promoted the cause of international peace and security and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. He are therefore gratified at the conclusion of the strategic arms reduction Treaty (START) between the United States and the Soviet Union. Pakistan particularly welcomes the recent announcement by President Bush of bold and far-reaching measures encompassing, inter alia, the elimination of land- and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons.\nThese measures represent a major advance in the process of nuclear disarmament and call for an appropriate response from all concerned Powers. It is our expectation that this process will eventually lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Until then, effective and legally binding international arrangements must be worked out to assure all non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons.\nHe support the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. Pending the conclusion of such a treaty, nuclear-test-ban agreements could be arrived at among regional States in different parts of the world. Those regional agreements would not only act as important confidence-building measures but would also facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\nPakistan supports the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on the total prohibition of chemical weapons. He also stand for the prevention of an arms race in outer space.\nGlobal disarmament efforts should be supplemented by disarmament measures at the regional level. A regional approach offers the most realistic prospect for meaningful progress towards disarmament, since threat perceptions and security concerns vary from region to region. This approach is steadily gaining ground, as evidenced by the adoption of a resolution on regional disarmament by an overwhelming majority at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nNegotiations for conventional disarmament at the global and regional levels must also be pursued vigorously, especially because of the increase in the sophistication and destructive power of conventional weapons. Naval disarmament has become an equally important objective, because of the rapid augmentation of the naval power of some States. The acquisition of aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines by some regional States is a cause of grave concern to their smaller neighbours.\nPakistan has proposed a number of disarmament measures to strengthen peace and stability in south Asia. He believe that a regional approach to non-proliferation, based on the principles of equality and non-discrimination, is the most feasible and effective means of resolving the nuclear issue in south Asia. In addition to several proposals made to India since 1974 to keep our region free of nuclear weapons, including the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free some, the Prime Minister of Pakistan recently put forward three important proposals for arms control and nuclear non-proliferation in south Asia. These proposals call for: first, consultations by the United States, the Soviet Union and China with India and Pakistan to ensure nuclear non-proliferation in south Asia; secondly, bilateral arrangements or a regional regime for the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction in south Asia; and, thirdly, a mutual and balanced reduction of forces in south Asia consistent with the principle of equal and undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments.\nHe are encouraged by the positive response to our proposals by many countries. He hope that India will also respond positively, particularly to the proposal for five-nation consultations for a nuclear non-proliferation regime in south Asia.\nNuclear non-proliferation in south Asia is a vital condition for regional peace, security and progress. The proposals made by our Prime Minister are in keeping with the spirit of the times and reflect our genuine desire that the south Asian countries should concentrate their efforts on economic development through the diversion of resources currently allocated to defence to developmental purposes.\nThe question of arms transfers should be considered within the overall context of conventional arms control, taking into account the indigenous defence production capabilities of different countries as well as their legitimate security concerns.\nEach country has the sovereign right to determine its own legitimate defence needs. Many small and medium-sized States, lacking indigenous defence production capabilities, are obliged to depend upon international transfers of arms to meet their essential security needs. In some cases, threats to their security emanate from neighbouring States with large indigenous defence production capabilities. Obviously, the denial of the acquisition of arms through international transfers would endanger the security of such small and vulnerable States. This would have a destabilising effect on international peace and security. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that controls on arms transfers do not create or perpetuate dangerous regional imbalances.\nThe world stands on the threshold of an era of great promise and hope. The prospects of lasting peace are more real today than at any time during the past many decades. But for many people in the third world this peace is distant and irrelevant. While the incidence of death by bullets may have declined, the number of victims of deprivation continues to rise. Illiteracy, disease, malnourishment, unemployment and destitution are on the increase. We see in painful detail, day after day, the horror of human poverty. This is not real peace.\nThe 1980a have been described as the decade lost to development. If corrective action is not taken, it may well spawn a lost generation by the year 2000. According to some estimates, the industrialized world today consumes S6 trillion more of income annually than at the beginning of the 1980s. Over the same period it reduced its annual aid to the developing world by $4 billion. Worst still, its net resource transfers to these countries, taking account of interest payments, became negative. In 1990 alone the negative transfer of resources from the developing to developed countries amounted to $39 billion.\nThe Declaration (S-18/3) adopted at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly provided an agreed platform for common action. It encompassed commitments by the developed and developing countries to enhance international economic cooperation and to revitalize growth and development. In the spirit of the Declaration, many third-world countries have taken wide-ranging measures to enhance efficiency in economic management. Concrete steps have been taken by their Governments to liberalise their economies, roll back State intervention and promote trade and investment.\nIn Pakistan, too, the Government of Prime Minister Muhammad Hawas Sharif has launched a programme of comprehensive economic reforms involving privatization and deregulation with a view to encouraging economic activity in a liberal framework. These reforms, unprecedented in Pakistan's history, are aimed at stimulating and encouraging market forces as the main engine of economic growth. In accordance with its policy of self-reliance, the Government is focusing on the promotion of exports and foreign investment in the country.\nRegrettably, the International economic environment remains heavily weighted against the developing countries. The industrialised countries have not matched with concrete steps the reform measures being taken in the third world. Our efforts at fostering growth and development continue to be stonewalled by the denial of market access, dwindling resource flows, absence of foreign investment and a crushing debt burden. Rapid action aimed at resolving these problems is imperative. A special effort will have to be made to ensure a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, which remains deadlocked on a number of key issues.\nClose partnership is also necessary to counter the escalating threat of environmental degradation. The international community must evolve a comprehensive strategy for addressing this grave problem. The responsibilities and obligations of both the developed and the developing countries were clearly spelt out in resolution 44/228. A truly universal compact on the environment will have to incorporate the developmental dimension. The commitments involving the transfer of additional resources and Environmentally sound technologies to the developing countries will, therefore, have to be honoured in full. It is the sincere hope of the Pakistan delegation that preoccupation with short term gains will be resisted and that the course which we had set before us at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly will be pursued earnestly.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a crucial moment in the history of the United Nations. The role of the world body in achieving the independence of Namibia, promoting peace in Central America, reversing aggression in the Gulf and settling regional disputes has earned for it the respect and gratitude of the international community. While we rejoice as at these successes, we expect a more forceful contribution from the United Nations in fostering economic growth and development in the third world. This is clearly not a task beyond our reach. If bitter adversaries of yesterday can become willing partners of today, it is not too much to hope that the immense resources of the world will be utilised for mankind's collective well-being. Only thus will we be able to lay the foundations of everlasting peace and universal prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should first like to extend to Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Mali on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His abilities and the wealth of experience he has gained from his long diplomatic service to his country, Saudi Arabia, which enjoys grant prestige internationally, guarantee the successful outcome of our work. \nMy delegation is particularly pleased by this choice because our two countries have had good relations for centuries - reflected, for example, in the pilgrimage to Mecca of Mali's Emperor Kankou Moussa in 1324. Let me assure the President of my delegation's full cooperation with him as he performs the important functions entrusted to him by the Assembly.\nMy delegation also extends its congratulations to Mr. Guido de Marco, who led the work of the forty-fifth session with wisdom and efficiency. I take this opportunity also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, who has strengthened the Organisation's role with devotion, farsightedness and perspicacity.\nThe admission of a new Member is always an important step towards the Organisation's universality. My delegation therefore welcomes the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania.\nAs the second millennium draws to a close the world is undergoing profound changes. The cold war, which led the major Powers to sink vast sums into the race for weapons of mass destruction, is now over. In my delegation's view, the disappearance of the blocs created by the cold war should make it possible to put greater emphasis on new areas of common interest and new relations of cooperation with developing countries. In Africa the changes have taken the form of the fall of dictatorships based on monolithic systems that stifled the deep-seated and legitimate aspirations of peoples to freedom and justice and impeded all economic and social development.\nThe country I have the signal honour of representing here has not been unaffected by the struggle to acquire fundamental freedoms. The people of Mali rose up against a greedy and incompetent dictatorial regime that had plunged the country into poverty. The youth of Mali, its women and Its democratic forces, both civilian and military, paid heavily to bring an and to 23 years of repression, corruption, social Injustice and waste. Since the people's uprising of March 1991, Mali has bean led by a Transitional Committee of Popular Safety and a Transitional Government, which have launched the country on a process, on the one hand, of establishing a pluralistic democracy and a state of law and, on the other, of reorganising and restoring our economy with a view to achieving greater social justice.\nFrom 29 July to 12 August this year a national conference was held at Bamako which brought together all the country's vital forces and socio-political tendencies. That conference, which was marked by a fruitful and open debate on the country's future, adopted a draft constitution that established the foundations for true democracy based on scrupulous respect for human rights, the multi-party system and separation of powers, as well as on affective participation by the people in their own development and management of their affairs through regional collectives. Furthermore, to buttress the state of law the Transitional Committee and the Government decided that Mali should ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to abolish the State Security Court, which was a special tribunal established and used for evil ends by the former regime.\nSince June 1990 a state of crisis has existed in the northern regions of the country. An uprising by young Tuaregs has created an atmosphere of\nInsecurity in that part of the country. Despite the Agreement signed in January 1991, some  of the fighters are continuing the confrontation. Defenceless villages have been the targets of regular attacks by armed groups, who plunder shops, set fire to administrative offices, steal cattle, seize vehicles and run away. Disturbed by this situation, Western non-governmental organisations that were assisting us in our struggle against, poverty have left northern Mali.\nNotwithstanding such actions, the Government of Mali is patiently seeking a negotiated democratic solution to the crisis. Thus, a conference on the problem in the north has been announced for mid-November at Timbuctoo. The Transitional Committee and Government are in contact with various factions of the Tuareg Movement, in an attempt to encourage them to participate constructively in the peace meeting at Timbuctoo.\nOur draft convention adopted at the National Conference provides for institutions that will guarantee fruitful decentralisation, by which the people will be able to administer themselves through their elected representatives in village councils and regional factions and assemblies.\nWe are seeking a democratic solution to the crisis because of our convictions and because the state of law we wish to achieve in Mali compels us to do so. Hence, we appeal to all States that can exert any influence on the Tuareg youth movements to help us solve this problem so that we may all work together to achieve the economic and social development so needed in all parts of Mali-\nSoviet-American rapprochement has been accelerated. The changes taking place in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and the dissolving of the Warsaw Pact have significantly contributed to creating an atmosphere of trust between former adversaries. The atmosphere of mutual\nunderstanding and trust that now prevails in the world enabled the great Powers to cooperate in the Security Council to put an end to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. On that, occasion the United nations diligently and effectively Implemented the resolutions of the Security Council. We truly welcome that. We would hope that the Organisation will be able to act in a similar manner vis-\u00e0-vis all the resolutions adopted by the Council so that the International community may stop giving the impression that it is following a double standard.\nNow that the Gulf War is over, we must deal with the situation prevailing in the Middle East. Israel continues to pursue its policy of establishing settlements in the occupied Arab territories, and the tragedy of the people of Palestine is still with us. He therefore hope that the current initiatives to convene a peace conference on the Middle East will lead to a comprehensive settlement that will recognise the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and guarantee security for all States in the region, in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the Organization.\nIn Africa, where colonization has ended, apartheid, this crime against humanity, still has not been eradicated from the continent. True, the fierce struggle of the South African people, international pressures and the initiatives undertaken by President De Klerk have brought about some improvement in the political situation in that country. Yet the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa still has no right to vote, to determine its fate or freely to choose its leaders. The tribal violence, fomented and supported by certain backward looking forces, is continuing to bring sorrow to the country. My delegation feels that a total lifting of the economic sanctions is premature, and we urge the international community to continue its pressure on the South African Government in order to ensure that the process now under way leads to the complete dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic and multiracial society. \nIn Angola, the signing of the cease-fire agreements, the establishment of a multi-party system, and negotiations between the various parties to the conflict have opened the way to a new era of peace in that country. He express the hope that the people, so long traumatized by war, nay at last be able to devote themselves to the country's reconstruction and development. We also hope that peace and fraternal concord can be quickly achieved in Mozambique, and we must all work towards that end.\nAs for Namibia, which acceded to independence under United Nations auspices, it remains deprived of Halvis Bay, its only deep-water port. We support the negotiations now under way between the Governments of Namibia and South Africa with a view to reintegrating that entity into Namibian territory.\nIn Western Sahara, the forthcoming referendum on self-determination, under United Nations auspices, cannot but raise hopes that that part of Africa will soon have lasting peace, an element indispensable to the subregion's development.\nWe welcome too the remarkable progress made in Liberia along the road to peace and national reconciliation, under the aegis of the Economic Community of West African States.\nWith regard to the Horn of Africa, my delegation urges the Ethiopian authorities to continue their dialogue with a view to strengthening peace in that country, and we appeal to the groups fighting in Somalia to respect the terms of the agreements signed at Djibouti last January.\nIn Cambodia, the establishment of a Supreme National Council, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has created new prospects for peace. The continuation of that salutary process and the success of the peace negotiations will surely lead to the organization of free elections that will put an end to the Cambodian people's long years of suffering.\nOn the Korean peninsula, my country, which has diplomatic relations with both Koreas, hopes that their admission to membership in the United Nations will be a prelude to their peaceful reunification.\nMali would encourage the communities of Cyprus to continue the negotiations begun under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nOn disarmament, the easing of tensions in international relations has contributed to the conclusion of numerous agreements in recent years. The signing last July in Moscow of the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT) agreements, which had been the subject of rather difficult negotiations for decades, encourages our belief that the world is moving towards an era of peace.\nNew States have added their signatures to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the work on a total ban on chemical weapons has produced encouraging results; and the United States Government has recently taken a position in favour of the elimination of short- and intermediate-range missiles. All of this creates an atmosphere of trust, which is a prelude to real disarmament.\nIn this respect, Mali welcomes the announcement made on 27 September 1991 by President George Bush of measures taken unilaterally by the United States concerning nuclear arms and nuclear forces and we also welcome the response by President Gorbachev to these initiatives. My delegation believes that this political will can come to completion only if it is accompanied by the allocation to the development needs of the poorer countries of the resources thus made available.\nI cannot talk about international relations without mentioning with a sense of anguish the serious economic crisis that affects the developing countries in particular. The burden of foreign debt, the drop in export earnings, the inadequacy of the resources devoted to development - all of this has worsened socio-economic conditions in many countries.\nThe debt of developing countries, entered into under conditions that did not take into account the interests and concerns of most of the people, has now exceeded $1.2 trillion and it is one of the major obstacles to the success of economic reform programmes, structural adjustment and recovery of growth in those countries. So far, approaches taken to finding a solution to the serious problem of debt, although encouraging in some respects, have come far from meeting the real economic concerns of the developing countries.\nSeeking a solution for the developing countries' external-debt problem requires greater solidarity within the international community and shared responsibility between creditors and debtors. The growth objectives of the developing countries must also be taken into account.\nIn this regard, my delegation would support the proposal, contained in the annual report of the Secretary-General, that an international conference on the financing of development should be convened. The international community must also pay special attention to the implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s, adopted by the Second United Nations Conference in Paris in 1990.\nAppropriate action must be taken urgently, at the international level, to ensure remunerative prices for commodities and to dismantle tariff and non-tariff barriers that hamper the exports of the developing countries. My delegation hopes that current negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the holding of the forthcoming session of the United Rations Conference on Trade and Development (UHCTAD) will yield positive results.\nIn Africa, despite the laudable efforts made by the African Governments in implementing structural-adjustment programmes, the economic situation and living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. The United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery, 1986-1990, which had raised great hopes, did not, unfortunately, meet the legitimate concerns of the people and leaders of African countries for growth and viable economic and social development. He would urgently appeal to the international community for urgent and appropriate action towards the adoption of a consistent programme of cooperation for the development of Africa for the 1990s. In this connection, my delegation welcomes the initiative of the Japanese Government for convening a summit conference on development in Africa in 1993.\nThe determination of the African countries to emerge from economic stagnation is expressed in their firm resolve to build viable economic structures of integration. The recent signing, in Abuja, Nigeria, of the treaty establishing the African Economic Community is an excellent example of this.\nSustained economic and social development cannot be achieved unless there is a healthy environment. Mali, victim of drought and desertification, has to work within the constraints of a rather difficult environment in carrying out its various development projects and programmes. Thus, my country attaches great importance to the success of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992.\nMali, in January 1991, played host to the Pan-African conference on environment and lasting development. Now Mali reaffirms its adherence to the Bamako Convention banning the importation of waste into Africa, and the Bamako commitment, which defines Africa's five main priorities in environmental matters.\nThe World Summit for Children, held in 1990, enabled the international community to set new goals as it works to improve the living conditions of children throughout the world. Mali co-chaired the World Summit for Children and wishes to reaffirm its devotion to the cause of children as3 its commitment to accord priority status to the implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action issued at the Summit.\nThe democratic opening up begun in most developing countries and the economic liberalisation which has resulted there from need constant support from the international community. Young democracies deserve support, individually and collectively, for there can be no true democracy without development.\nQualitative changes in my country last March exposed the economic crimes of the old regime. Those who supported that regime, using secret banking arrangements, shifted great amounts of capital abroad, capital that, if repatriated, could help to solve some of our financial difficulties.\nWe can see how the single party covered up its criminal practices. In a country where children die of diarrhoea and other everyday illnesses, where school-aged children do not go to school for lack of money, a gang of crooks diverted billions of CFA francs into foreign banks. The Transitional Committee for the Safety of the People (CTSP) and the Government of Mali are firmly resolved to bring them to justice, in keeping with the rule of law and with international norms. We shall bring to justice all those who, by abusing their power, have led to bloodshed among our people and all those who have perpetrated economic crimes.\nHere, we would appeal to all countries and peoples of the world, in the spirit of solidarity and justice, to cooperate with Mali in searching for and retrieving these funds. We would ask our partners to follow the example of the Swiss authorities, who have just made available to the Government of Mali the necessary means to try to get back the diverted capital. To help Mali recover and repatriate the funds of the old leaders is to help the economic development of our country and to help our people socially.\nThe preservation of our democracy deserves the full support of the industrialised countries, and they can help to do this by restoring the diverted capital, which is in fact the fruit of the criminal plundering of the resources of the African people, who have been bled dry.\nMankind is at a decisive stage in history. All together, we must build a new international order, one with a broader and fairer outlook, a new international order founded on justice.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, may I at the outset convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your competence and experience are well known as well as the faith of your country, Saudi Arabia, has bestowed on the principles and ideals of the United Nations Charter are the best guarantee for the success of the session. I should also like to offer my deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, for the sincere efforts that he and the other members of the bureau have exerted to bring the forty fifth session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\nOn behalf of my country, I should like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to the Secretary General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his continued efforts to enhance the credibility of the United Nations in accordance with the noble principles of this international Organisation and, in the same way, to promote international peace and cooperation. May I also place on record my country's appreciation for the efforts made by the Secretary-General in the course of last year with a view to finding a peaceful settlement of the Kuwait crisis. We also wish to thank him for his continued efforts to resolve the Middle East hostage problem.\nIt is encouraging to note that the increased influence of the United Nations is accompanied by the enlargement of its membership and the enhancement of its universal character. My country welcomes the admission to membership in the United Nations of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, hoping that their admission will pave the way for lasting peace in the Korean peninsula. I should also like to welcome the admission to membership in the United Nations of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Estonia and the Republic of Latvia. We wish them every success for a more stable and more prosperous future.\nThe current session is being convened at an outstanding epoch in the history of international relations, especially the history of the United Nations. Never before have the East and West entertained such positive relations which have, in large measure, contributed to the creation of an opportunity for the successful settlement of many pending international problems,\nWe have, therefore, to take advantage of the favourable international climate and should have no hesitation in benefiting from the opportunity to save the next generation from the scourge of war, to preserve the dignity of man and to enhance security and stability on the basis of the principle of the sovereignty of States, justice, respect for law and constructive cooperation among all States. These concepts are inseparable from the foundations on which the United Nations was built. We are all duty-bound to preserve these lofty notions, with a view to bringing, to present and future generations, happiness, security, prosperity, and freedom from violence, instability and confrontation.\nThrough this Organisation, the International community has called for freedom and cooperation. Hence, it is incumbent upon the United Nations to spare no effort in preventing itself from being used as a means of inflicting suffering on mankind. Instead, it should be utilised as a vehicle for development and cooperation among nations.\nThe Kuwait crisis was the greatest test of the present world order after the cold war. With God's blessing, the new order passed the tent and a great triumph for the United Nations was achieved. The international community has decisively demonstrated that international relations must be governed by international law and that the use of force in settling disputes between States runs counter to international legitimacy.\nOnce again, my Government expresses its deep appreciation to all the brotherly and friendly States that hastened to support the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. That support constitutes a genuine precedent in international cooperation. On this occasion, I should like to convey my country's gratitude for the courageous and decisive stand taken by the international community, and especially the stand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which spared no effort in supporting the rule of law and in implementing the United Nations resolutions.\nBeing located on the Strait of Hormuz, my country is fully aware of its great responsibilities. Hence, we have endeavoured to play a constructive role in the establishment of regional security in the Gulf. We have been working along with our brethren in the GCC on future security arrangements at the Gulf, Arab and International levels, in an effort to bring about security and stability. In this context, we have always consulted with our neighbours in the Gulf, especially the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nI must say that, despite the problems in the aftermath of the crisis, amidst the horrible tragedies, great suffering and lose of life, there is room for hope. I may even go so far as to say that our steady progression towards International peace is gaining momentum, simply because we have a common interest in peace, stability and economic prosperity. Our awareness of this common Interest and our striving to promote it have led us to believe that regional cooperation will replace antagonism and confrontation so that we may look forward to a better future.\nThe Gulf crisis demonstrated that security and stability in the region are closely linked to the world economy. The developed countries were not alone in suffering economically as a result of the crisis. The developing and poorer nations too were hit hard by unstable oil prices and the halt in trade. That fact makes us realize that regional security arrangements are made not solely to ensure security and stability in the Gulf region, but also to serve the interests of the entire international community.\nThe Palestinian problem has been the main source of instability and dispute in the Middle East. Until and unless that problem, as well as the other problems pending between the Arabs and the Israelis, is resolved, the chances of further crises in the Middle East will be. unfortunately, greater. For the sake of peace in the entire world, the Palestinian problem should therefore be settled.\nBelieving in the importance of constructive dialogue, my country has supported international endeavours to find a peaceful, lasting and just solution to the Palestinian question on the basis of International legitimacy and United Nations resolutions. In this regard, we welcome the United States efforts to convene a peace conference on the Middle East between the Arab States and Israel. We also welcome the positive response to that conference by the Arab parties directly concerned with the question.\nThe Sultanate of Oman's support for peace will not recede or give in to despair. We have supported all efforts to find a peaceful solution and we are confident that the Arab States are truly serious in their search for peace. Three years ago, the Palestinian National Council adopted an historic resolution which paved the way for peace. It was unfortunate, though, that Israel responded with more intransigence by continuing its occupation and suppression of the defenceless inhabitants of the occupied Palestinian territories.\nWe sincerely hope that Israel will not miss this historic opportunity and that it will enter into serious negotiations with the Arab States in order to bring lasting and comprehensive peace to the area. We call upon the States that have good relations with Israel to convince it to halt its policy of building Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories and to stop oppressing the Palestinians, because that policy constitutes a major obstacle to serious negotiations for peace.\nFrom this rostrum, we call on all the States of the world to make every possible effort to bring about peace on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 33B (1973). In that respect, the United Nations bears a special responsibility to do its best to implement its resolutions. Then we will see the dawn of the new international order in the Middle East, and only then will peace prevail between the peoples of the area.\nWe have seen greater progress in other parts of the Middle East. In Lebanon, we followed with satisfaction the positive steps taken by the Lebanese Government in the implementation of the Taif agreement. We are optimistic that security and prosperity will prevail in all parts of Lebanon. Once again, we call on the international community to seek the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which provides for the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanese territory.\nThe situation in Afghanistan calls for further efforts. My country pays tribute to the United Nations for its efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the Afghan question, the latest of which is the Secretary-General's peace plan of 22 May 1990. However, there are about 5 million Afghan refugees. Two million handicapped Afghans have been waiting for an end to the bloodshed, not to mention a million or more people who have lost their lives since the outbreak of the crisis. Such tremendous suffering requires a decisive and definitive solution based on an enlarged national Government and the return of refugees to their homes.\nOnly six years have elapsed since Oman established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Those years have witnessed many great events that have altered the character of the Soviet Union, as well as that of the rest of the Eastern European States, which was impossible for anyone to foresee at that time. The greater part of credit for those developments in the Soviet Union goes to those man who have led the campaign of reform and openness with a great deal of courage and determination. Their names will go down in history as symbols of freedom and peace at this stage which was brought about thanks to their policies. Perestroika and glasnost, adopted by the leadership in the Soviet Union since 1985, have paved the way for the emergence of Soviet leadership personalities with a considerable measure of determination and courage and a sense of responsibility.\nHere I cannot but pay a tribute, once again and on behalf of my country, to the Soviet people and to the Republic of Russia for its positive stand vis-\u00e0-vis the events of last month. The failure of the coup and the restoration of legitimacy to the Soviet Union are truly a great victory for world peace and yet another triumph for the new world order.\nThere are many indicators that there is progress towards peace. There is more room for the United Nations to play a full role in the settlement of disputes. We are very optimistic about Cambodia, South Africa, Cyprus, the Horn of Africa, Central America and the other regions of the world where the peoples have always longed for freedom, security and peace. The United Nations has played a major role in these issues. It is still called upon to make further efforts to solve these and other issues. Despite the heavy load entrusted to the United Nations, being the highest world order it has a special responsibility for so many issues and related problems which surpass the capacities of individual States.\nWe think it is of paramount importance to lay the foundations of an integrated global strategy for the environment that will preserve the planet's resources for current and coming generations. In this regard, great challenges which will face the Conference on environment and development, to be held next year in Brazil. The industrial countries, which have achieved their present positions of strength and prosperity through economic development, have a special responsibility in this respect because their development has set the example which the others have emulated by utilising the resources of the Earth without due regard to the relationship between the environment and development. Soil erosion, scarcity of water resources, ozone depletion, air pollution and the extinction of certain plant, and animal species demonstrate, more than ever before, the need for further efforts to find common principles for the preservation of the global environment. In all this, the industrial countries cannot disassociate themselves from their historic responsibilities. Today the environment in the Gulf is suffering as a result of hundreds of raging oil-well tires in Kuwait. Although commendable efforts are being made to contain the damage left by oil slicks in the Gulf, further international efforts are still needed. Although we take comfort from the cooperation extended to us because we believe that cooperation is necessary for solving problems in the future, we feel that constructive cooperation is the only way to march forward.\nThere is another international problem, namely, the arms race. My country welcomes the initiative taken by President George Bush last Friday in respect of his country's unilateral reduction of its strategic nuclear armaments. We welcome the steps taken by both the United States and the Soviet Union to limit their nuclear arsenals. We urge them to take further steps in this direction. In our assessment of potential sources of a nuclear threat, we believe that the principal danger emanates from the uncontrolled proliferation of these overkill weapons.\nThe world today experiences acute economic problems which know no boundaries. Recently, advancement in the developing world has been sluggish and inflation is rampant. The gap between the North and the South has widened. While we welcome the great achievements of the new world order in the political field, we look forward to the application of the new ideals of that order in the area of economic relations. It is in the interest of all that prosperity comes to the developing world because it is the basis for progress in economic development for everyone. On the other hand, we hope that the developing countries will take concrete steps towards market-oriented economic policies that will be a solid foundation for economic progress and prosperity.\nWe have been following the progress made so far in this regard. However, we note that there remains a lot more that has to be done. While we welcome the debt reduction extended by the developed world, we must note that many developing countries are still groaning under the twin burden of indebtedness and lack of investments. The prospects of progress are limited because of the protectionist economic policies which deny access to the markets of the rich world. Further efforts are also needed to enhance the transfer of technology. Realizing the significance of cooperation, my country is anxious to participate with others in shouldering the common responsibility in this regard, hoping that our region will see new funds to promote investment and development. There is a dire need to reform the world economic order. The new political order cannot be secured in the future without increased economic cooperation between the developing and developed world. Unless these issues are earnestly and comprehensively addressed, the least developed countries will continue to be hostage to their huge burdens, so much so that they can claim to have been deprived of the privileges enjoyed by independent States. When sovereignty is denied either through invasion, occupation or economic stagnation, even though it may exist in form but not in essence the seeds of Instability and future conflict will find therein a fertile soil. Our gathering together in the United Nations makes us recognise the right of every Member to full sovereignty both in form and in essence. When we stuck together within the framework of the United Nations, we witnessed how the new collective will was able to defend sovereignty in the framework of a changing political world system.\nNow we have a genuine opportunity to enhance national sovereignty through collective action to develop the new economic world order. That will not only increase economic opportunities for the least developed and poorer countries, but also effectively and permanently help to maintain international peace and stability.\nFinally, we in the Sultanate of Oman look forward with faith and optimism to the day when all peoples of the world represented in this Assembly as sovereign and independent States will have rid themselves of poverty, oppression and aggression in a world of cooperation, security, stability and economic prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, it is indeed a pleasure for me to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which is destined to play an important role in further improving the activities of our Organisation.\nWe pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the representative of Malta, for his dynamic leadership of the work of the last General Assembly session.\nThe Mongolian delegation expresses its deep satisfaction at the admission to the world Organization of seven new Member States, namely, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Estonia. We sincerely congratulate the representatives of these States.\nYet another year marked by the strengthening of positive trends in the world has passed - a year that stands out for events which will long serve us all as both a lesson and an impetus in the steady march towards a new world order based on general acceptance of universal values.\nFirst of all I should like to allude to the Persian Gulf crisis. The aggression against Kuwait was undoubtedly a challenge to the entire world community, and it reacted to it in a fitting manner. The aggressor was stopped. In our opinion, the major lesson to be learned from the crisis was that the strong cannot defy with impunity the will of the weak and that the United Nations will no longer tolerate similar actions which flagrantly violate its Charter.\nThe outcome of the crisis, logical by all ethic and moral norms of inter-State relations, significantly reinforced the faith of nations in the feasibility of bringing into being a just world order. And this is very important, since in the world of today the weak outnumber the strong by far. It is not diktat that the weak need, but assistance and just and equitable cooperation on the part of the strong. This certainly does not diminish the significance of other legal norms and principles of inter-State relations. Such fundamental values as democracy, human rights, freedom of opinion and choice, among others, must be seen as basic criteria.\nSecondly, the year 1991 has brought about promising results in the field of disarmament. It was not long before the Soviet-American agreement on the elimination of medium and short-range nuclear missiles was concluded. And today it is already fully implemented. Moreover, both sides have worked out a new agreement on the substantial reduction of offensive strategic armaments. This is an important step along the path towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The new initiatives by the President of the United States of America, George Bush, on the further reduction of nuclear weapons, in our view, open up far-reaching vistas in this area.\nWe welcome the decision by China, France and some other countries to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Encouraging progress has been made in the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons, which, we hope, will lead to the elaboration of an appropriate agreement as early as next year. The Third Review Conference on the biological weapons Convention demonstrated the necessity to reaffirm and strengthen this important instrument.\nFurthermore, the improvement in the international atmosphere in recent years is to be credited to a large extent to the Soviet perestroika and its policy of new thinking. Under its impact, events of historic significance have taken place, particularly in Eastern European countries. In the final analysis, they have brought the cold war to an end. Further improvement in international relations and solutions to urgent global problems will depend to a certain extent on the pace of Soviet perestroika. Therefore, practically the entire world community has a vested interest in its success. This is amply evidenced by the unanimous and almost universal condemnation of the August putsch in the Soviet Union. The putsch was a serious test both for the Soviet perestroika and for the still fragile trend towards accord on a global level. Perestroika withstood the test, and the cause of democracy and freedom has been defended through common effort. Perhaps this is one of the main lessons of the August events in the Soviet Union. How that perestroika has embarked on a qualitatively new stage, even more encouraging prospects open up for global cooperation on all the pressing problems of today.\nThus, in the main, healthy trends dominate the political landscape of the planet, and the tendency of these processes is such that it leads us to believe that they are irreversible. This will certainly prove to be true under appropriate conditions and if efforts are made.\nFor many years now the Asian continent has been a region ridden with the most dangerous hotbeds of tension and conflict. However, the situation of late is being redressed. Recent dramatic changes in the world and the turn of events in Asia itself offer grounds for hope in the possibility of eliminating these hotbeds. An active search by the parties concerned, with the participation of the United Nations, is yielding tangible peacemaking results.\nWe welcome the emerging consensus on the convening of the Middle East peace conference, with the participation of all parties concerned. The time has come to put an end to the sufferings of the Palestinian people. Justice should be completely restored in all its aspects, taking into account the legitimate interests of all the countries of the region. It should be borne in mind that the events in the Persian Gulf have again clearly shown the danger of the unresolved situation prevailing in the Middle East.\nAs we see it, the tension on the Korean peninsula is somewhat lessening. There is a desire on the part of both sides to seek mutually acceptable solutions. This is evidenced by the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas to membership of the United Nations. We express the hope that this important step will facilitate the peaceful reunification of Korea, in accordance with the aspirations of its people. New, positive developments have taken place in the solution of the Cambodian problem. It is our hope that the forthcoming Paris International Conference in Paris will be crowned with success.\nIn tune with the times are the ongoing efforts to resolve the protracted Afghan crisis. In our opinion, the recent agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States to discontinue the supply of weapons to all Afghan sides has strong positive potential.\nMongolia attaches great importance to the strengthening of mutual understanding and trust in Asia, and has in the past offered some ideas towards this end. In particular, my Government put forward the possibility of regular dialogue between the countries of the northern part of Asia and the Pacific for the purpose of exchanging views on ways and means of finding optimal solutions to existing problems. There are many military-political, economic, ecological and other problems. One can say that the atmosphere in the region is far more conducive to the promotion of ideas in this field, including the idea concerning the establishment of a new world order.\nIn spite of the diverse mosaic of the Asian continent, with its many ethnic, religious, cultural and other differences, the Asian countries have many things in common. The solution of urgent problems of economic and social development and the degradation of the environment, as well as many others, requires active joint efforts. We believe that closer attention and better understanding are needed if the correlation between these common dilemmas is to be grasped and, on that basis, the search for new forms of wider and closer cooperation between the countries of Asia is to start.\nThere have been rapid changes for the better in the political climate of our planet, but we cannot say the same about international economic relations.\nRegrettably, there is no evidence of any substantial changes in that area.\nThe gap between \\\"rich\\\" and \\\"poor\\\" countries is growing. The problem of external debt is far from being resolved, although some limited steps are being taken in this direction. Protectionism and other unjust conditions of trade, as well as difficulties in gaining access to advanced technology: all these problems are putting a heavy burden on the overwhelming majority of developing countries. In the light of the need to resolve these problems, we see the importance of intensifying the efforts to give new impetus to the North-South dialogue.\nIn our view, the Declaration of the General Assembly at its eighteenth special session and the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade serve as an important basis for achieving the objective of establishing just and truly equal economic relations.\nToday the problem of environment protection rightly occupies pride of place on the world agenda. We fully share the view that this problem cannot be divorced from that of development. In that context, the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, should clarify many issues.\nMongolia is one of those countries where the Communist experiment has failed. For the second year now, the country is advancing along the path of profound political and economic reform. Significant progress has been achieved in the cause of democratisation and the liberalization of social life in all its aspects. At present, the main task boils down to consolidating the democratic achievements and creating the legal and other prerequisites for ruling out the possibility of the revival of the old order. In this respect, great importance is being attached to the drafting of a new constitution, whose adoption is scheduled for November this year. \nThe Government is taking energetic steps to put the country on the rails of a market economy. A great many acts have been drafted and enacted for the purpose of securing the legal basis for the development of market relations. The process of privatising State property is gaining momentum. The prices of goods and services have, in general, been liberalised. A new banking system has been introduced. A stock exchange is being established. Favourable conditions are being created for the private sector - private enterprise, and so forth.\nHowever, the resolution of economic problems is facing enormous difficulties of an objective as well as a subjective nature. The old system of economic relations is collapsing, but the new one has not yet been shaped. The same is true of our foreign economic relations. All these factors have slowed down production, have led to an increase in unemployment and excessive inflation, and have had other negative consequences.\nThe country is experiencing an acute shortage of financial resources. In particular, this gives rise to serious difficulties in supplying the population with food and consumer goods, and industry with raw materials and spare parts. A near-total lack of the qualified personnel required to carry out economic reforms both in management and in organization, as well as in technology, poses a very serious problem.\nUnfortunately we are not in a position to solve these problems on our own; we have to seek outside assistance. I should say that we are already receiving such assistance from Japan, the United States and other countries. In the near future, credits will be provided by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which Mongolia joined this year. Such assistance and credits will be of great help in solving pressing problems. But that is not the end of the matter. We also regard this as an expression of effective support for our democratic reforms.\nIn this context, I should like, on behalf of the Mongolian Government, to express deep gratitude to all those who have given our reforms firm moral, political, material and other support.\nWhile tackling the urgent tasks of today, we are at the same time laying down the foundations for tomorrow's development. From this point of view, the development of cooperation with other States is of great importance, and our foreign policy is directed towards this end. Today Mongolian foreign policy is completely cleared of the ideological components that until recently had a strong impact on it.\nThe Mongolian People's Republic is willing to develop equal, mutually beneficial relations with all countries, on the basis of respect for sovereignty, free choice of social development, and non-interference in the internal affairs of each other. We shall exert every effort to further strengthen our all-round close ties with our two great neighbours - the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.\nMongolia is open to expansion of its relations with the developed countries in various fields. Today we can say that a good start has been made in certain directions. In general, a lot has to be done to reveal and take advantage of mutual opportunities to develop relations. We will further strengthen our solidarity with the developing countries and continue to cooperate with than in resolving our common tasks and problems. It is precisely for this reason that Mongolia recently joined the Non-Aligned Movement. In so doing, we also ware proceeding from the premise that the historic mission of the Movement is far from being completed and that its positive role in international affairs will continue to endure.\nThis year will mark the thirtieth anniversary since the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations. During these years, Mongolia has endeavoured to make its contribution to United Nations efforts towards maintaining peace and strengthening international understanding and cooperation. I should like to mention here that on my country's initiative important documents on such issues as the right of peoples to peace. Disarmament Week, to foster the objectives of disarmament, and International Literacy Year, as well as on a number of other issues relating to social and economic development, have been adopted by the United Nations and the organizations in its system.\nIt is important to emphasize here that for us the United Nations is no longer an arena of ideological rivalry and confrontation. We see in it a genuine centre for harmonizing and coordinating the actions of nations in the attainment of common goals. The Mongolian delegation holds that the proposals put forward by the representatives of various countries in favour of improving this Organization merit the most careful and thorough consideration.\nWe join in the words of gratitude that the representatives of many countries have addressed to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who will before long have accomplished his mission in that office. His activities in that post have been marked constant and visionary search and by creative initiative, and are truly deserving of our high commendation.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOur traditional meeting this year in New York is taking on particular significance because of the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to membership in our Organization. This has accentuated the universal character of the United Nations.\nThe last page of the post-war period has now been written. The wounds caused by its crimes can now be allowed to heal. Without prejudice to the analysis given by my colleague, Mr. Hans Van Den Broek on behalf of the European Community and its member States, I should like in my turn to dwell on some of the lessons which can be learned from the evolution of international relations during the past 12 months.\nAs emphasized by the Secretary-General in his report, we can descry in the world situation, at one and the same time, a degree of peril and of promise.\nDuring the period under review, it has been Luxembourg's honour to preside over the work of the European Community for the first half of this year. We cannot fail to note that during those six months the world has witnessed a war of exceptional scope and has witnessed the collapse of one of the super-Powers and, finally, seen the resurgence of the old demons in the Balkans.\nAs far as the Gulf is concerned, may I recall from this rostrum that the readiness of the Twelve to embark upon a dialogue with Iraq as a last-ditch effort on the basis of the Security Council resolutions was both sincere and total. The 12 Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Community were the last ones to confer with our Secretary-General in Geneva before he departed for Baghdad. Upon his return they were the first to be informed of the insurmountable intransigence of the Iraqi dictator. As President Jacques Delors recalled at the time, \\\"We must bear in mind that we should not pay for peace at the price of shame.\\\"\nSince the very inception of military operations, the Luxembourg presidency has in all circumstances been able to provide and maintain full and frank dialogue with all parties to the conflict. The ministerial troika of the Twelve has never travelled so extensively. They were present immediately after the war in Damascus, in Tripoli and in Tehran. Joint Presidency-Commission missions from the European Community visited the Turkish-Iranian and the Turkish-Iraqi frontiers where the Kurdish people are congregated.\nThe concept of \\\"security zones\\\" initially mooted in April during an extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg and 24 hours later formulated here at our Organization's Headquarters with the assistance of the Secretary-General remains, in the light of the enormity of the tragedy, an operation that is full of promise for the future.\nI venture to state that never in the course of the last 20 years of European political cooperation have the Twelve been able to react to events with such promptness and concerted mobilization of effort. The Community could not, on the other hand, act where it had no authority to do so. I am referring to the military operations in the Gulf.\nFor its part, the Soviet Union has been a constant source of tension and disquiet in the course of the past year. The absence this year of our old colleague Eduard Shevardnadze recalls to mind the circumstances that surrounded his resignation at the head of Soviet diplomacy. We are aware now that the departure of this most eminent of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union indeed coincided with the inception of a period of instability in the Soviet Union that was likely to compromise the promises, the accomplishments and the dividends reaped at the end of the cold war.\nThanks to the men and women in Moscow and St. Petersburg, an oppressive system which has been bankrupt wherever it had been established has today been destroyed once and for all. Thus the tidal wave that spread from Budapest and Prague 24 months ago has swept away the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain and, finally, the Soviet totalitarian colossus. Henceforth, at least in Europe and perhaps for the first time, the words of liberty and democracy have the same meaning and connotation in Madrid as in Prague, in Rome as in St. Petersburg.\nA third source of profound concern and danger is represented by the recent tragic turn of events in Yugoslavia. A factor of stability during the long period of the cold war and the unchallenged leader of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, Yugoslavia is at present in the grip of domestic upheavals which conjure up the phantoms of the past and the ghosts of conflicts we thought had been laid to rest once and for all. Yugoslavia is on the edge of an abyss. It is caught up in a crucial conflict the outcome of which cannot leave any of us indifferent. The Yugoslav crisis brings to the fore questions which we cannot ignore.\nAs I recently recalled at the CSCE meeting dealing with the human dimension, which is still going on in Moscow, the self-determination of peoples is quite clearly neither a panacea nor the only prescription for dealing with crises like these. The logic of the Republics shut up within their own frontiers contrasts with the logic of peoples and minorities who find themselves living in large territories with vague boundaries.\nFrom these three crises and dangers there are lessons to be learned.\nFirst and foremost, the end of a polarised world. We had already noted this for some time as the antagonisms between the United States of America and the Soviet Union became blurred. At present it is an accomplished fact.\nFor our Organization, which since its creation has been bedevilled by that antagonism, a new era has been ushered in. The Gulf war has brought to the fore the Security Council's possibilities for action on the basis of consensus among the five permanent members.\nNaturally, for those who, hitherto, have made capital out of the impotence of the United Nations, the future looks rather uncertain. The winds of freedom will no longer be checked. In Africa, in Central and Latin America, in Asia, the creative forces of democracy, freedom and reform will finally eliminate the last oppressive regimes which are at bay because they have been condemned.\nDictators of the world, it is midnight.\nIt is abundantly clear that, in view with what has been happening in the Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia, State structures that are maintained by force alone have hardly any chance of survival. Peoples cannot coexist if there is no freely expressed will. The tragedy of the three Baltic Republics should make this abundantly clear to us.\nOn the other hand, through the accentuation of national identities we will witness the emergence of new nations and perhaps even unexpected re-unifications. Germany, Yemen and, shortly, the two Koreas strengthen my conviction that artificial divisions will finally meet the same fate as any constructions that go against nature. \nIn the light of the International norms we have set ourselves through the Covenant, there is another lesson that needs to be learned: an adaptation, unthinkable a short time ago, is nowadays absolutely essential: I am speaking of the duty of humanitarian assistance which was first applied at the time of the Kurdish tragedy. This duty necessarily means that we must rethink our whole concept of the principle of non-interference in a country's internal affairs.\nSimilarly, the emergence of a new concept - that is, the duty of democratic intervention recently advocated by Mr. Michel Rocard - is along the same lines. Respect for the commitments undertaken in our Charter, which remain our fundamental law, as well as those subscribed to through numerous subsequent texts, should now be capable of sanction.\nNevertheless, legislation in the field of human rights should not be regarded as an end in itself. It is through specific actions, such as those initiated through the Commission on Human Rights, that progress can truly be made.\nAmong possible orientations I should like to recall for the Assembly's consideration the proposal I made a few days ago in Moscow during the CSCE meeting on the human dimension. That proposal is designed to improve the opportunity to enlist the assistance of special rapporteurs to investigate conflicts. As I see it, this is something that could be done at the request of a specific number of States, even without the agreement of the State involved. Furthermore, every man and woman, wherever they may reside, should have the right to individual recourse against any violation of his or her fundamental rights before the International Court of Justice.\nWhat State would be willing to shirk such obligations at the risk of being outlawed from the family of nations? In this context, we must unreservedly support non-governmental organisations which are so courageously fighting for respect for the freedoms and dignity of men and women. Faced with governmental inertia, the initiatives of the non-governmental organisations are often decisive.\nIn the light of. what I have just said, I vesture to assert that we are now definitely on the way towards a rebirth of democracy and then also of our Organisation.\nThis rebirth would not be complete if substantial progress were not made towards disarmament and an increase in security for all. In Europe in recent months the last medium-range nuclear missiles have been destroyed. The START Treaty which was signed in Moscow between the Soviet Union and the United States is only intended to be the initial step in a more significant reduction of central nuclear arsenals. For that reason, an agreement on the final elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons is even more urgent.\nThe Gulf war - I would venture to hope - has convinced each and every one of us of the frightful risks involved in the presence of a dictator of the ilk of Saddam Hussein. Significant action in order to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as well as their means of delivery is a subject that should be taken up as a matter of priority during this session of the General Assembly.\nControl of conventional-weapons sales is a natural corollary of this process. I would voice the hope that the action of the Community and its member States which was announced at the last European Council in Luxembourg, with a view to establishing a register of weapons transfers, will be broadly supported in the General Assembly.\nAmong those disputes which have been hanging fire for a long time now the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is undoubtedly the most destabilizing for peace in the world. The elimination of the Iraqi menace has provided a momentum which may gradually pave the way to final peace in that region. The whole range of problem surrounding this conflict can henceforth be taken up in a new spirit. The terms of settlement should naturally be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Their full implementation is a duty that gives us every reason unreservedly to support James Baker's Initiative, with which Europe quite naturally associates itself.\nA great deal of discussion has been devoted to the place of the Community at the peace conferences table. As I said earlier, it appears to me to be pointless to dwell endlessly on proving the usefulness of the presence of the Community, which has 343 million citizens and which is separated from this hotbed of tension by a single sea. The markets on both banks of the Mediterranean are complementary. This is of course equally true for Israel and for its Arab neighbours. Indeed it is only Europe that can offer them economic prospects; neither the Soviet Union nor the United States can do so. Naturally such prospects can exist only in the context of a Middle East which has resolutely embarked on the road to peace.\nIn the light of the tremendous distress of millions of persons in various parts of the world, urgent action needs to be taken. In the case of these extreme cases of underdevelopment it appears inevitable that the international community has a duty to assist them. In view of what has been learned in recent years I would venture to state that there is a very clear link between democracy, human rights and development.\nRespect for fundamental freedoms and the rules of democracy can no longer be regarded simply as a legal or even a moral imperative. Such respect is essential if development is to flourish and there is to be economic growth. The lessons learned in recent years from Central and Eastern Europe go well beyond the European continent.\nThe functioning of democratic representative institutions, the primacy of the law, and political pluralism are all essential if there is to be a favourable basis for economic development. The Community has spelt out these requirements in a number of provisions of the Lome Convention. This approach is also to be found in the agreements negotiated with the countries of Latin America and Central America. They were reaffirmed in Luxembourg during the first half of this year at the meetings which the Twelve held with the Gulf Co-operation Council as well as at the meeting with the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nWith the end of the East-West rift the concept of a third world as a separate political entity is in its turn becoming blurred. Having rid ourselves of totalitarian ideologies which have fallen into bankruptcy everywhere, we are now collectively involved in a single economic system which I am convinced will, in the long run, make it possible for all people on Earth to be emancipated.\nIn this context I must emphasize that there can be no lasting development unless there is scrupulous respect for environmental concerns. It is my hope that at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held next year, the number of decisions taken will exceed the length of the speeches made.\nIn recent times we have heard a great deal about a new world order following on the Gulf war. I do not know whether it will exist one day, since no one has really thought about it so far. Nevertheless one thing does seem to me to be essential and therefore deserving of our attention at this end of the twentieth century: the world is being transformed at an unprecedented rate. A number of oppressed peoples are aspiring to the benefits of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Dozens of new democracies have come into being in recent years. They are asking for cooperation, open markets, credits, the rescheduling of debt and political dialogue. They all wish to have their share of progress. \nCurrently the world is still largely dominated by protectionism, waves of uncontrolled immigration, xenophobia, the upsurge of nationalistic extremism, racism and elitist ideologies. If we consider all the elements, we can easily see once again that the concept of security is by no means simply military; it also encompasses socio-economic systems and values.\nThe European Community, in keeping with its aspirations and its interests, is seeking to provide itself with the ways and means for shouldering its responsibilities. Political union and economic and monetary union are essential if Europe is to participate in the construction of tomorrow's world. The action of the Twelve has already provided a striking example of what it can do at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which it has now become the linchpin.\nThe work of renewal in Europe cannot fail to have an effect in our Organization. It must be noted that for some years now the Security Council has been acting with exemplary efficacy and in close cooperation with the Secretary-General. The number of peace-keeping operations has increased. It is surely striking that last spring four new operations were launched in the Gulf, in Western Sahara, Angola and El Salvador in less than two months.\nThe exercise of restructuring the economic and social sector of the United Nations has been successfully initiated, and the President of Luxembourg was very pleased to have been able to submit the not inconsiderable contribution of the Twelve. The task of making reforms in the work of the General Assembly should be carried out in such a way as to rationalize that work and make it more significant. Reforms must necessarily be made in the operations of the Secretariat, making more efficacious the means of action at the disposal of the Secretary-General. The recent session of the European\nCouncil, in the light of experience gained from recent international catastrophes, called for strengthening of the coordinating machinery for emergency action undertaken by the United Nations. Steps should also be taken to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the prevention of conflicts.\nThe Secretary-General shortly to be appointed by the General Assembly will thus have a vast field of endeavour to organise and structure in order to prepare the United Nations for the year 2000 Our Organisation, confident of its renewed capacity to act, should have a range of effective tools capable of safeguarding international peace and security, meeting the many socio-economic ills, helping States in their difficult process of democratic and economic transition and, finally, promoting respect for human rights and the primacy of law in international relations. These are the challenges which will face the new Secretary-General and those who will be assisting him. \nThe new Secretary-General will be able to draw on the exemplary work done at the head of the Organization by Mr. Perez de Cuellar, to whom the Luxembourg Government extends its deep gratitude. I have been able to ascertain, through my numerous personal and official contacts, the lofty commitment of the Secretary-General. His departure will inevitably leave a void. May those who tomorrow assume the daunting task of carrying on the torch be inspired by the example set by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.\n"

We thank him for a job well done. Similarly, my delegation pays a deserved tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his tireless efforts - spanning a period of 10 years - in the search for global peace and harmony. He has, indeed, served us well through some of the most trying moments in the history of our Organization. Zambia warmly welcomes the admission to our midst of the new Members, namely, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Their admission is clear testimony of our resolve to attain universality in the membership of the United Nations. In the case of the two Koreas it is my delegation's hope that their membership will hasten the process of the reunification of their motherland.\nThe demise of the cold war era has injected a welcome spirit of cooperation and accommodation in international relations. In this regard the preservation of international peace and security, the primary goal of the United Nations, is now a real possibility. There now exists an atmosphere conducive to the fulfilment of the goals and purposes of the United Nations. Public perception of the United Nations and confidence in it have consequently been greatly enhanced. Indeed, the United Nations now truly stands as a centre-piece of multilateralism. This is as it should be.\nAs is well known, the United Nations was established with the primary goal of the maintenance of international peace and security. To that end the Organization was to serve as the central forum for negotiations and the harmonization of actions of Member States. In this respect the United Nations has a solemn and legitimate responsibility for ensuring the realization of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\nIt is encouraging to note that in the recent past important agreements have been concluded, including the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). My delegation has also welcomed the recent initiatives announced by the President of the United States, Mr. George Bush, relating to nuclear disarmament and the encouraging responses from the President of the Soviet Union, Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev. These efforts are laudable and quite significant in terms of maintaining the momentum generated by the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.\nThese efforts notwithstanding, it remains Zambia's firm view that real efforts should continue to be made towards the realization of the goal of general and complete disarmament. To achieve this noble goal, the United Nations must work tirelessly towards a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\nZambia welcomes the decisions by the Governments of China and France to become parties to the non-proliferation Treaty. My Government has also decided to become a party to that Treaty and the instruments of accession have already been deposited with the depositary Governments.\nMy delegation is gratified by the progress achieved thus far in the peaceful settlement of a number of regional conflicts with the active involvement of the United Nations It is our sincere hope that this momentum will be accelerated towards the resolution of conflicts in Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador and Western Sahara. We appeal to the parties to the conflicts to cooperate with the Secretary-General and ensure the implementation of the relevant resolutions.\nConcerning Afghanistan, we welcome the recent agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States to cease the supply of arms to the parties to the conflict. We urge the Afghan people to enter into negotiations among themselves in order to bring peace and stability to their country.\nWith regard to Cuba, we strongly support the proposal by the President of Venezuela, Mr. Carlos Andres Perez, urging the Government of the United States of America to lift the economic embargo against that country, which has been in effect for more than 30 years. It is our view that this proposal reflects the prevailing international political and security climate.\nIn Yugoslavia we urge the European Community to persevere in its efforts to bring an immediate end to the armed hostilities in that country, which have already taken a heavy toll in both lives and property.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be of great concern to the entire world. We in Zambia continue to believe that there can be no lasting solution to the situation in the Middle East until the question of Palestine is justly addressed in terms of Security Council resolutions 242 (1969) and 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions.\nWe continue to support the call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East involving all parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization. We consider the continuing construction of new settlements in the occupied territories as an obstacle to peace and we call on Israel to desist from this untenable practice.\nWith regard to Liberia, we continue to support the sincere efforts under way to restore peace and stability in that country. In this regard, we urge the international community to provide generous humanitarian assistance to the people of Liberia.\nThe situation in southern Africa remains a source of serious concern to us in the region.\nIn South Africa, despite some progress made so far, much still remains to be done to realize the objectives of the United Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa. Thus, the system of apartheid still remains intact. To date no negotiations between the regime and the representatives of the oppressed people leading to the adoption of a non-racial and democratic constitution have taken place. This is the most urgent and pressing issue to be addressed.\nA climate conducive to such negotiations is yet to be created. In this regard we note with great concern that several hundreds of known political prisoners are still being held in contravention of the United Nations Declaration. Furthermore, the recent confirmation by the South African regime of its collusion with, and funding of, the Inkatha Freedom Party casts serious doubts on its declared commitment and intentions to negotiate in good faith towards the dismantling of the apartheid system. In view of these developments, there is still a need to maintain international pressure in order to encourage the regime to work genuinely towards the negotiation and adoption of a new constitution. My delegation welcomed the recent agreement between the Government of Angola and UNITA. We express our sincere hope that this development will lead to the restoration of peace, stability and unity in that friendly neighbouring country.\nWith regard to Mozambique, however, despite the Government's good intentions to engage in negotiations with RENAMO in good faith in order to bring peace to that country, RENAMO has continued Its acts of violence against the population and government installations. He hope that RENAMO will soon realise that an opportunity now exists for peace in that country so that the Mozambican people as a whole can usefully exert their efforts towards economic development. We appeal to all those who have leverage over RENAMO to urge it to show a sense of seriousness of purpose in the negotiations.\nThe prevailing international economic situation remains precarious for most developing countries. As a consequence, there is a marked deterioration in standards of living and the human condition in the majority of countries. It is the view of my delegation that this unfavourable situation will persist in the absence of sincere efforts to establish a new international economic order, an order based on democracy, justice, equity, equality ana fair play in international economic relations.\nThe democratisation of international economic relations has now become more imperative in view of the rapid political changes taking place in the world today. It is evident from the dramatic changes in the world that there is a universal desire for the institution of democracy, including protection and promotion of human rights. This universal 6 sire must effect sound management of the environment and distribution of the world's scarce resources and ensure equitable participation in international economic decision-making. The field of International economic relations is beset with numerous and complex global problems.\nFirst and foremost are the twin problems of development and the environment. The current negotiations for international instruments and agreements to facilitate sustainable development are, indeed, a challenge of unparalleled importance.\nThe obligation to cooperate, an important message of the Brundtland Report, is being put to the ultimate test. Official and individual behaviour is being called upon to rise above self-interest and policies of a bygone era. Thus we must all lend our support to an early, equitable and satisfactory solution of the problems of the environment and development.\nThe present conditions of both the environment and development are untenable. This is clearly recognized in the present state of preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, be it in the climate change and biodiversity negotiations or in the Preparatory Committee itself.\nMy delegation wishes to underline the need to comply with the obligation to cooperate. The international community must not settle for the lowest common denominator - preserving the world's forests - without initiating changes in unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and while avoiding answering the legitimate questions of developing countries on new and additional financial resources and non-commercial access to environmentally sound technologies.\nFor the Conference on Environment and Development to be successful the remaining phase of the preparatory process must involve enhanced efforts to agree on an ambitious, wide-ranging package that meets the challenges of sustainable development. Time is of the essence.\nAnother major problem besetting the world economy Is the external debt of the developing countries. The problem still calls for a comprehensive, satisfactory solution to be found urgently. It Is disappointing that legitimate calls for meaningful debt reduction have received counter calls for repeated rescheduling. Rescheduling are at best stopgap measures.\nThe international community must commit itself to addressing the issues surrounding the external debt problem of developing countries. By so doing, we shall be in a better position to shape the agenda that would lay the groundwork for the emergence of conditions of real growth and sustainable development in developing countries. For nobody can realistically expect the developing countries to enhance their savings potential when they have continuously to transfer their scarce financial resources to developed countries. Nor should the dynamism of the international financial system also be dependent on net transfers of financial resources from the developing countries. In its present configuration, the external debt of developing countries discourages initiative and achievement and breeds instead a sense of misfortune and frustration.\nIt is all very clear now that, in order to be sustained, the prevailing wave of political liberalization needs to be firmly anchored on universal economic liberalization. It is therefore disquieting to see some parts of the world, including developing countries, liberalize their economies on an unprecedented scale while some parts are firmly entrenched in impenetrable protectionism. Is it not an anomaly that those who preach free markets and win converts in the process should continue to fetter their markets?\nThe success of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations depends on a meeting of minds on universal economic liberalisation. This calls for urgent and meaningful concessions by developed countries, especially in the key areas of market access, agriculture, services and intellectual property all taken together.\nThe question of reform of the global financial and monetary institutions, notably the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, is as valid today as when it was first raised. Very few people doubt that the Bretton Woods institutions have simply been marginalized. Even those institutions feel the challenge to their relevance.\nIn addition, the stringent conditions attached to structural adjustment programmes championed by these institutions are unsustainable, particularly for many of our weak, vulnerable and dependent economies. Therefore, there is need for substantial reflection by these institutions on the current design and implementation of their structural adjustment programme. Another area requiring urgent attention is the structure and process of decision-making in the Bretton Hoods institutions. In this regard we view with concern the fact that the Group of 7 has arrogated to itself some of the critical powers of these institutions on the governance of the world economy and, to some extent, some issues on the United Nations agenda. This has been done to the detriment of the developing countries.\nIt is thus imperative that the Group of 7 should effectively address itself to the serious problem of relevance facing the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as well as the wider question of democratic governance of the world economy. At the same time, it is incumbent upon the United Nations, in the spirit of enhancing multilateralism, seriously to address both these questions, which directly affect the effectiveness of these institutions, in terms of the delivery of their services.\nLet me take this auspicious occasion to reiterate my country's article of faith in the principles and purposes of the United Nations. Clearly, more than ever before, the United Nations remains the only institution through which multilateral dialogue can take place in a truly democratic manner. We must, therefore, work towards strengthening the Organization politically and financially in order to make it more responsive to the needs of its Members. As we talk of collective security, which encompasses political, economic, environmental and human rights dimensions, among others, the quest for shared leadership and mutual responsibility becomes all the more imperative. These can be realized only through the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWithin the past few years the world has witnessed a series of momentous and dramatic political events. These followed closely on the remarkable changes is East-West relations and other positive developments in the international arena. The nations of the world have found new hope for a brighter future, and there has been renewed faith in the United Nations as the forum in which political, social and other issues can be constructively addressed.\nIt is at this historic juncture that the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to congratulate the President most sincerely on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. As a founding member, his country has had a long association with the United Nations, and we regard this first attempt on its part to seek the Chair of a major organ of this Organization as a manifestation of the national desire to play a wider and more proactive role in the post-cold-war era of international relations. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has the undoubted capability of becoming an influential player. My delegation looks forward with confidence to a rewarding and successful session under his experienced and visionary leadership.\nI should also like to congratulate his immediate predecessor. Professor the Honourable Guido de Marco of Malta, who conducted the affairs of the forty-fifth session in a skilful and exemplary manner appropriate to this epoch of world history. \nOn behalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent, and the Grenadines, I wish to extend a warm welcome to the seven new Members admitted at this session of the General Assembly. Their admission gives further hope for eventual universality of membership in the United Nations. In the case of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we express the hope that separate membership in this world Organisation will help to promote the fulfilment of the historic desire of the Korean people for unification. We have much in common with the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Their admission highlights the special position of developing countries in today's world of powerful economic blocs. My delegation also takes pleasure in welcoming Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all former members of the League of Nations, to membership in this Organization that has succeeded it. Their admission represents a triumph for democracy and self-determination. Our experience, however, induces us to caution these Baltic States against pinning their faith in the narrow context of \\\"nationalism\\\". We would advise that they build on the trade and fiscal harmony they have historically enjoyed among themselves and their neighbours rather than plunge as small nation States into international rivalry.\nOn this occasion I wish also to express the profound appreciation of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the distinguished Secretary-General for his skill and commitment in handling the affairs of the Organization and in promoting the goals and objectives of the United Nations. We also commend him for his usual instructive and thoughtful report. \nOver the past decade the Secretary-General has presided over our Organization, bringing it from the nadir of esteem to its rightful place at the zenith of world government. He all owe him a debt of gratitude, and we wish him good health and long life so that in his retirement he can witness the continuation of his outstanding work towards the realization of lasting world peace built on solid foundations of respect for human rights, territorial integrity, democracy and economic prosperity.\nI join my Caribbean colleagues in soliciting the support of Member countries for the application of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) for observer status in the General Assembly on terms similar to those that have been prescribed for other associations of States. He are of the view that an observer relationship with the United Nations will greatly enhance CARICOM's ability to coordinate the activities of Member States in its areas of competence.\nIn our part of the world, the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continues vigorously to promote unification among the countries of the Windward Islands. Harsh reality has taught us that irrespective of the efficiency of national economic management and planning within any one of our micro-States it is virtually impossible to satisfy the rising expectations and demands of our populations. \nCurrent initiatives to establish political union among the four Windward Islands represent a concerted attempt to merge the limited resources of those islands to create ail enhanced environment for economic growth and development. In this regard. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has faithfully honoured its commitment to the free trade provisions within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States as well as recently enacted measures aimed at stimulating production and consumption of CABICOM goods and services. Even as we face, together with other developing countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group, possible harmful effects on our economies owing to developments in the European Economic Community after 1992, we continue to pursue structural-adjustment policies intended to further our integration into the world economy. He, the banana-producing countries in the Caribbean, being essentially small mountainous islands, have difficulty competing with large-scale consortiums in other countries, and our democracy and social progress could well be damaged by any sudden denial of our trading arrangements in a post-1992 Europe. He would hope that the assurances given to us in the Lome Convention will be honoured in letter and in spirit.\nMy delegation views with satisfaction the recent developments in Central America. In Santiago in June, at its twenty-first regular session, the Organization of American States celebrated the triumph of democracy in the hemisphere by issuing the Santiago Commitment to Democracy. It was the first time in the history of the organization that all the Governments in attendance were democratically elected. He also welcomed the admission of Guyana and Belize as full members of the organization\nMy Government is pleased with the continued development of functional and economic co-operation between Guyana and Venezuela. The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is particularly pleased with the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Belize and the Republic of Guatemala. This is an important event formalizing the existing friendly relations between the two Governments and establishing a harmonious environment for the resolution of outstanding issues between the two States. My Government stands ready to assist in the resolution of these historical disputes in our region.\n\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to express its appreciation to the international community for the assistance given to Haiti in holding free and fair elections in which that long-suffering country was able to select its first democratically elected President. How that the democratic process has once more been abruptly sabotaged, we hope that every effort will be made to ensure its restoration as soon as possible. He must act now, swiftly and decisively.\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to congratulate the people of Suriname on the peaceful and dignified manner in which they conducted their recent elections.\nWith the attainment of independence by Namibia the full struggle against apartheid has shifted to South Africa. The South African President, Mr. F. W. De Klerk, has lifted the ban on political organizations and individuals in South Africa. This was followed by the repeal of certain laws and increased dialogue between the Government and the African National Congress. These are welcome indications of the beginning of real progress in the initiation of a genuine process for the abolition of apartheid. We are, however, concerned about the continuing violence taking place in South Africa, and we welcomed the agreement of the Government and all other parties on the procedures to be followed for containing the violence.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has consistently joined the call for intensification of the campaign to eradicate apartheid and will remain committed to its complete abolition.\nPowerful winds of democratisation and independence are sweeping through the Soviet Union. Fundamental changes in the relationship between the central Government and the Soviet republics mark a watershed in the political\nevolution of that once powerful nation in modern-day history. While we hail the independence of the Baltic States and other Soviet republics, we wish to express the hope that, in the interest of world peace, some controlling authority will remain intact, in whatever governmental arrangement that eventually evolves from the current fluid situation, to exercise control over the enormous nuclear arsenal in the possession of that military super-Power. My delegation is heartened by the Soviet announcement that control of nuclear weapons will be centralized under one specific unit of the military.\nIn the view of my delegation that is critical for continued negotiation of effective arms-control agreements, for the maintenance of Soviet credibility as a major broker in the Middle East peace process, and for the ability of that country positively to influence events in other areas of tension.\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines believes that this is an era of great opportunity for the removal of the world-wide threat of nuclear warfare. In that regard we commend the historic unilateral action of President George Bush in eliminating entire categories of certain nuclear weapons and in offering to negotiate further sharp reductions in the most dangerous kinds of globe-spanning missiles. We are delighted by the reciprocal response of President Mikhail Gorbachev, and we hope that other nuclear Powers will respond in kind in order to accelerate the process of arms reduction and bring us closer to the ideal of turning swords into ploughshares.\nMy delegation reiterates its strong commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes among States. The Gulf war is now behind us, but the international community must continue to recognize the potential for conflict which remains in the Middle East. \n\nIn our statement at the forty fifth session of the General Assembly, the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines put forward its views on a peace conference to deal with the recurring problems of the Middle east. He therefore welcome the diplomatic efforts of President Bush and Secretary of State Baker in convening a duly structured international conference. He view this as the key to a lasting solution of the conflict. The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains convinced that any solution to the problem facing the region must be predicated on the legitimate concerns of the Palestinian people and the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to live in peace and security within recognised borders, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Only a final resolution of these problems will make us confident that the Middle East will be at. peace, and that the rich oil resources of the region will be governed by the marketplace rather than the political agenda.\nThe end of the cold war between East and Hest has resulted in unprecedented progress being made in the peaceful resolution of other regional conflicts by political means. The search for peace in Cambodia, Afghanistan and other hot spots of the globe has intensified. Increased cooperation among the five permanent members of the Security Council and the expanded role of the United Nations in the area of conflict resolution are manifest in the initiatives which have been taken to achieve political solutions in Angola, Ethiopia, Cyprus and Western Sahara. There is no doubt that these positive changes in the world have been propelled by the harmonious relations that have developed between the Soviet Union and the United States in recent years. \nThe world watched with bated breath as the events of August unfolded in the Soviet Union. We saw the prospect of the reversal of the gains of glasnost and perestroika and a return to the totalitarian communist ways of old. But the people of the USSR had seen a new day of freedom, democracy and hope and had defeated the reactionaries with their indomitable will, bare hands and massive numbers. It is a great victory for the human spirit and the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines salutes the people of that vast country and the leadership that rallied them.\nIn the atmosphere of freedom and euphoria of the immediate post-cold-war era, many long-subdued ethnic and regional conflicts are surfacing with possible disastrous effects. President Bush has called it a \\\"resumption of history\\\", and the United Nations faces a new set of challenges in these areas - namely, to preserve the peace without suppressing human rights and the self-determination of peoples. My delegation praises the efforts of the countries of the European Community, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the United Nations Security Council to resolve the Yugoslavian crisis.\nIt is undeniable that the world body has scored impressive points in dealing with political issues and also in the maintenance of international peace and security through an increased level of cooperation among the major Powers. In the area of economic and social development, however, little progress has been made towards the improvement of the institutional capacity of the United Nations to deal with certain economic and social issues. With the spirit of cooperation existing in the Organization, the time is opportune \n\nfor concerted action to reform the Economic and Social Council to make it a\nmore relevant and responsive forum for focusing on priority policy themes.\nThe present window of opportunity also allows for real progress In the reform of other areas of the United Nations. These should include the process of selecting the Secretary-General, reorganisation of the Secretariat, with special emphasis on accountability and reporting relationships, and streamlining the General Assembly agenda and committee system. The\u00bb delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is aware that the discussion on restructuring is a continuous process which requires sustained consultation and the widest participation of Member States. We support the step-by-step process and agree with those who feel that only those proposals on which there is consensus should be presented for consideration by the General Assembly.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is deeply concerned at the increased activities and costly implications of transnational drug trafficking. Trafficking in drugs is not an isolated national issue. It transcends all national boundaries and calls for increased cooperation on a multinational basis.\nThe Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has declared a relentless war against drug dealers and their supporters and we welcome the increased commitment of the international community to cooperate and collaborate on efforts to eliminate the production, trafficking and abuse of illicit narcotics.\n\nOne of the most formidable challenges of our time Is the protection of our environment. The ever-growing list of threats is by now well known! global warming, desertification, deforestation, and the ever increasing volume of waste, to mention a few. These phenomena threaten the very existence of our planet and require an energetic global response. In this regard, we fully support the convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Such a conference must establish an international strategy by adopting ways and means of obtaining environmentally sound development in all countries of the world.\nMy delegation believes that the Rio Conference presents a great opportunity to develop realistic global measures for the protection of the environment. The Conference must not become a forum for the apportionment of blame or for pontification by those trying to take the high ground in the area of environmental protection. If the nations of the world could agree to a comprehensive programme of international cooperation in the field of environmental protection within an international framework that takes all aspects into consideration, including the development priorities of island States of limited land mass, and the imperatives of sustainable development worldwide, then the Rio Conference would be a seminal event in the history of our planet Earth. We cannot afford to fail.\nIn closing, let me urge all Member States to continue to demonstrate their unwavering confidence in this institution. The United Nations can only be as successful as its Member States allow to be. History has saddled us with a heavy burden of responsibility, and a:, we look towards the twenty-first century, we must, redouble our efforts to achieve the goals and ideas \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations: peace, security, human rights and fundamental freedoms, international cooperation and development for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. You have taken the stewardship of a session that faces both complex challenges and unique opportunities for taking historic decisions. We wish you every success. Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta presided over the first post-cold-war session of this Assembly last year. He guided the session to a successful conclusion and we thank him for his sterling efforts.\nThis year the United Nations has the pleasant task of recording its appreciation of the contributions of an extraordinary leader, Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar, pleasant because he has given us a decade of diplomacy that had helped bring many old conflicts to \u00ab resolution and created an atmosphere of hope for the relaxation of the few tensions that remain. Mr. de Cuellar deserves the accolades of both nations and families, for it can be said in all truth that his efforts have helped open discussions on issues that had held nations hostage for a long time and in a literal\nsense he has had a part in delivering hostages back to their families. For all these achievements we must thank him wholeheartedly.\nThe current session has once again witnessed further gains for the principle of universality of the United Nations, as the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Baltic States of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea have assumed membership of the world body. We congratulate them and welcome them to our midst. At the same time, we express our expectation that the admission of the two parts of the Korean peninsula will promote constructive interaction between them and with other Member States and contribute to their shared goal of reunification. It is our sincere hope that shared membership of the United Nations will accelerate progress towards this mutually desired goal, and that the energies of this Organization will be employed in facilitating that process.\nAt the last session of this Assembly we all counted the blessings that the demise of the era of super-Power confrontation had brought. As we did so, some faint contours of a new international order that could succeed the cold war era were gradually becoming visible. Those who were bold enough to attempt to identify and define those contours found it prudent to punctuate their theses with many caveats. They were aware of how fragile the still evolving trends were, how easily the new gains could be reversed and how great the potential was far the re-emergence of the fears and mistrust that characterized the passing order. The events and experiences witnessed since the last session have demonstrated that the emerging international order cannot be left to evolve spontaneously. A conscious effort is required on the part of the international community to identify, reinforce and give permanence to the positive trends that the collapse of the cold war era yielded and to suppress all the negative aspects and risks that accompany this process of transformation. We believe that the present session should seriously begin the process of considering measures that can be taken to consolidate the positive aspects emerging from the still evolving transformation of international relations.\nOur attention must remain focused on giving further impetus to the process of resolving regional conflicts and defusing focal points of tension around the globe. Major strides have recently been made in this area. We have today in our midst a united Cambodian delegation reflecting the progress made in consolidating the positive trends towards peace and stability in South-East Asia. We welcome the successful formation of the Supreme National Council, the legitimate body in which the unity, independence and sovereignty of Cambodia is to be embodied during the transitional period. The negotiations now set for the early convening of the International Conference in Paris and for the United Nations to facilitate a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Cambodian question.\nIn Western Sahara, Central America and Cyprus, the patient and untiring efforts of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar are yielding positive results. A cease-fire became effective in Western Sahara last month; we expect the Secretary-General's ongoing efforts in Cyprus to yield the desired result in the near future and believe that it will be possible to harness the good will of all parties involved to overcome all outstanding difficulties; and the process of national reconciliation in Central America is at an advanced stage.\nIn southern Africa we are on a sure path to peace in Angola. We command the diplomatic efforts that have led to the process that is now under way, with United Nations assistance, to bring to an end 16 years of war and to facilitate the attainment of national reconciliation among the Angolan people. The negotiations in Mozambique continue, albeit on a laborious path. In concert with others, Zimbabwe will continue to make its contribution towards the attainment of peace, stability and national reconciliation in that sister country.\nThe current session opened on a note of optimism on the Palestinian question and the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. The impasse on the Middle East peace process appears to have finally been broken. We welcome the diplomatic efforts that have opened up the prospects for launching a process of negotiation in that region, which has gained momentum, thanks to initiatives of the United States and the pragmatic approach of concerned parties in the region. He believe that the ultimate goal of that process should be a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement under which the Palestinian people will exercise their right to self-determination as envisaged in the pertinent United Nation resolutions.\nIn the same area, we applaud the efforts of the Government and the people of Lebanon towards the restoration of peace and stability in their country. The Security Council must assist the Government of Lebanon in extending its authority over all Lebanese territory. The continued occupation of southern Lebanon by Israel and Israel's refusal to comply with Security Council resolution 425 (1978) remain the major obstacles to the normalization of the situation in Lebanon.\nWhile there are some positive developments in the Middle East, that region still stands out as the major area in which acts of aggression and defiance of Security Council resolutions continue. The success of the current diplomatic efforts in the region and the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions will consolidate the positive trends that we expect to be a major element of the emerging new international order. Zimbabwe expects that the high standards applied by the Security Council in implementing its resolution pertaining to the Persian Gulf crisis should be adopted as the universal yardstick for all cases of aggression.\nThe measures taken to address the major threats to international peace and security since last year have demonstrated the ultimate validity of multilateral action within the framework of the United Nations. The prevailing international climate now permits the Security Council to carry out the functions envisaged for it in the Charter. However, as we have previously cautioned, the new partnership in the Council should not result in the body being used as a vehicle to promote and further only the interests of the powerful at the expense of those of the weak.\nWe are convinced that the time is ripe to implement the collective security arrangements based on the Charter of the United Nations. A number of important proposals have already been advanced on how this could be achieved. Zimbabwe attaches particular importance to the ideas offered by the Stockholm Initiative in the document entitled \\\"Common Responsibility in the 1990s\\\". We urge this Assembly to consider these proposals seriously. Also deserving of our attention is the proposal relating to the reactivation of the work of the Military Staff Committee of the Security Council and the possibility of assigning national military contingents to serve under the authority of the Security Council. It is imperative, in this regard, that rapid progress be made in instituting standing enforcement arrangements under the direct command of the United Nations, this would affirm the principle of collective security.\nZimbabwe has always stated its commitment to the goal of general and complete disarmament as the cornerstone of a peaceful world. We therefore welcome the recent announcement by President George Bush on the decision by the United States to make significant cutbacks in tactical nuclear weapons. Coming hard on the heels of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and receiving positive reactions from the Soviet Union, we view this development as a significant step towards a safer world, free from the spectre of nuclear annihilation, where vast resources formerly used for the arms race are channelled into development. We consider the imperative of \u00bb concerted effort to make the world a safer habitat to be one that deserves the fullest attention. We have, therefore, in line with the 1963 Declaration of the Organization of African Unity on Africa as a Nuclear Free Zone, signed instruments of accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and are in the process of lodging them with the depository Governments.\nWe also believe that the ideas offered by the Non-Aligned Movement in its Hague Declaration on the rule of law in inter-State relations would contribute tremendously to the consolidation of the positive elements that should be the building blocks for the emerging international order. Those ideas were well received by this Assembly when, at its forty-fourth session, it declared the 1990s a Decade of International Law. We expect the Assembly to follow this up and implement a programme of action that will establish the primacy of the rule of law in the emerging international order.\nWe face the real risk of taking one step forward and another step backward in our efforts to achieve the desired new world order. The positive trends set by the progress made in the areas I have referred to cannot be sustained if remaining regional conflicts are not addressed and if we allow new ones to erupt. In Afghanistan, we only did half the job. He should now assist the people of that county to achieve national reconciliation so as to facilitate a lasting solution to the conflict. We must also move swiftly and focus on defusing potentially explosive situations created by the simmering tensions in the Horn of Africa, Liberia and Central Europe. We commend the role played by the respective regional mechanisms in addressing these trouble spots. In the emerging order, it is inevitable that such established principles governing inter-State relations as that of non-interference will have to accommodate efforts by the United Nations and regional organizations to restore stability and peace under unique circumstances, such as those in Liberia and Central Europe.\nWe in southern Africa continue to view with grave concern the volatile situation in South Africa. Although more of the legislation that created the apartheid system in South Africa was repealed this year, apartheid itself remains intact. Constitutional negotiations which are clearly imperative for the creation of a free, non-racial and democratic South Africa should now be launched. The process of dialogue established between President de Klerk and the anti-apartheid leaders, which had generated some optimism last year, has recently been threatened, indeed endangered, by the continuing violence in the country, as well as by some activities of the Government which have raised serious doubts about President de Klerk's good intentions.\nThe recent developments in South Africa clearly demonstrate that the Government is not in a position to play the role of an impartial umpire during the constitutional negotiations as it had hitherto claimed. There are, undoubtedly, going to be extremely difficult moments on South Africa's journey to freedom. The critical question in South Africa Is clearly not whether the apartheid laws remain on the statute books or not: it is that of the transformation of the country into a united, non-racial and democratic country in which all the people enjoy common and equal citizenship and nationality, and have the right to participate in the Government and administration of the country on the basis of universal and equal suffrage.\nTo that and, negotiations leading to the drawing up of a new Constitution are now the most urgent and pressing question. We urge the people of South Africa, and their political parties and organisations, to work towards the establishment of conditions conducive to speedy movement towards the adoption of a democratic constitution. In the meantime, the international community must, as called for in the Assembly's consensus Declaration on apartheid of December 1989, step up all-round support for the opponents of apartheid and ensure that all existing measures aimed at encouraging the South African Government to eradicate apartheid are maintained.\nThe issue of failure in economic development and poverty stands out as the central unresolved issue in these times of transformation. It is estimated that today more than 1 billion people, or one in every five human beings, live in utter poverty. The United Nations 1991 World Economic Survey reveals that in 1990 economic activity slowed down in all parts of the world, and forecasts point to zero growth for the world as a whole in 1991. The number of devastating natural disasters and emergencies multiplied throughout 1990 and during the first half of this year. The failure of the international community to mobilize and give as swift a response to these crises as was given to the international political crises that erupted during the same period clearly demonstrated a deficit in determination and practical commitment to address the problems of poverty and economic development through multilateral cooperation and dialogue.\nMost vulnerable to the rigours that result from poverty and economic underdevelopment are the children of the world. We were gratified to see the international community focusing due attention on the plight of children at the World Summit for Children held here last year In our view, concerted action to improve the welfare of children can be further consolidated by making the specialised agencies of the United Nations concerned with children better equipped to tackle the enormous problems that they face. To this end, we hope the international community can take the practical step of making more financial resources available to such agencies, possibly by convening an international donors conference for this purpose.\nIf the emerging new era is to be based on peace, justice, stability and relations of cooperation, international economic problems should be addressed through dialogue and negotiations between the developed and developing countries. The achievement of a consensus on the national and international actions needed to accelerate development in the 1990s, as set out in the International Development Strategy adopted by the Assembly last year, as well as in the Declaration of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly, had rekindled some hope that the spirit of dialogue and cooperation was also extending to international economic relations. However, the lack of a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the end of 1990 dashed most of our hopes.\nThe developing countries have recognized that they have a responsibility to ensure a better future for themselves. In Africa, the Heads of State, Mating in Abuja last June, signed a Treaty establishing an African Economic Community. This was a landmark decision, the objective of which is to create opportunities for economic development through cooperation. However, it remains clear that the establishment of a favourable international economic environment is indispensable to the success of our efforts. We therefore call upon the developed countries to show the necessary cooperation and support for our efforts in addressing the acute problems facing the developing countries in the areas of protectionism in trade, commodity prices, external debt, transfer of resources, and transfer of technology. I should emphasise that our efforts to help ourselves are sure to fail should our products continue to encounter a wall of protectionist measures in the developed countries. We hope, therefore, that the Europe of 1992 and other emerging trading blocs will keep their doors open and will not be \\\"trade fortresses\\\".\nIn my own country, Zimbabwe, we have been acutely aware of the fact that fostering growth and development remains primarily a national responsibility and that emerging circumstances require us to gird ourselves for international competition. Zimbabwe is implementing an economic reform programme, the main components of which are trade liberalisation; structural adjustment, including strict public expenditure control aimed at reducing the budget deficit; the decontrolling of prices and deregulation of the economy; and the creation of a domestic environment conducive to increased local and foreign investment, which should lead to an expansion of the economy and the generation of more employment opportunities for our people. This is an ambitious but realistic programme aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth, which enjoys the support of global financial and economic institutions. The programme requires some $16 billion over five years, of which $12 billion will come from within Zimbabwe itself, while $4 billion will be sought from external sources. In this regard, I take the opportunity to invite the international community to extend the necessary support for Zimbabwe's efforts to re-invigorate its economy.\nWe believe that this body, the United Nations, should play a central role in the management of international economic relations and in assisting the efforts of the developing countries to achieve sustained growth and development and to eradicate poverty. He are pleased to note that the Assembly has already begun seriously to address ways of ensuring that the United Nations is well equipped to be sufficiently responsive to the emerging needs and challenges that we face in the economic and social fields today. We welcome, as a starting-point, the adoption at the resumption of the last session of the General Assembly last May of a resolution which provides guidelines for the restructuring and re-vitalization of the United Nations system in the economic and social fields. This task is an urgent priority deserving of our full and concerted efforts.\nIn conclusion, let me express our hope that the political will exists to effect all the changes that are beneficial to the international community as a whole, and to our Organization in particular, so as to make our world the place we envision.\n\nThe transition from the conflict-ridden paradigm of the past to a new one based on cooperation and interdependence is an imperative of our dispensation. Me are indebted to the founders of this our Organisation, who, with fewer material and intellectual resources than those at our disposal today, made a rich investment in peace and cooperation. He are indebted to our children who, with their hope, their optimism and their idealism, challenge the cynicism and avarice that have in the past threatened to fossilise our most cherished human values. Most significantly, perhaps, we are indebted to ourselves, for the currency with which the sad account in human suffering and deprivation can be settled is in our pockets today and our place in history depends on what we do now about that account. It is in our power to make it balance.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is for me both a great honour and a pleasure to take part in the work of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time and to address such a distinguished gathering at a time when the Organization has regained its vitality and its prestige. Indeed, the activities of the Organization over the past three years have highlighted the dynamism, the credibility and the strength with which this community of nations has been able to take up the challenges with which it has been faced.\nWe have been both impressed and elated by the efficiency and determination shown by the Security Council during the Gulf crisis and by the praiseworthy efforts made by the Secretary-General with a view to finding a final solution to the problem of the hostages held in the Middle East. It is in this context, one of hope and optimism, that the delegation of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, which I have the honour to head, congratulates you, Sir, on your election to preside over the forty-sixth session. We wish to assure you, dear brother, of our full cooperation as you carry out your noble task. Your election is a tribute to your country, a friendly country with which we share ideals and a common heritage within the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and a personal tribute to you. Your eminent qualities as a diplomat are known to all. We look forward to working for the success of the current session under your enlightened leadership.\nThe past year has been rich in major achievements, to which the President of the General Assembly at the previous session, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, contributed greatly. We congratulate him on having carried out his lofty responsibilities with such competence and dedication.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has done so much to restore the prestige of our Organization and who has served it with such faithfulness, and sometimes at great sacrifice, my delegation wishes to pay a heartfelt tribute. We also wish to express to him our deep appreciation of the outstanding manner in which he has carried out his difficult tasks in the past decade. When his term of office ends his name will occupy a special place in the annals of our Organization.\nWe also join other delegations in warmly welcoming the nations that have been admitted to our Organization during this forty-sixth session.\nThe session over which you are presiding, Sir, is being held at a turning point in the history of international relations. For several months now we have been witnessing an unexpected upheaval in the geopolitical map of part of eastern Europe. The spectacular developments that have been taking place in that region and elsewhere for three years have ushered in a decade, the last of this century, full of hope and new responsibilities for the community of nations.\nThe lessening of tensions between the two super-Powers has already yielded tangible results and given rise to significant positive trends in international affairs, as shows by the crucial role the Security Council played during the Gulf conflict. We hope that that role will be further strengthened so that we may see the dawn of a new world based on respect and justice, cardinal principles of the Charter.\nAfter a century of upheavals, revolutions and counter-revolutions set in motion one after the other by collectivist theories, and sacrificing individual freedoms and even freedom as a whole in the name of the masses and egalitarianism, the totalitarian Utopia has collapsed, a victim of its own pernicious system, rejected even by those who imposed it.\nCommunism, the basis of that philosophy of the denial of man as an individual, imprisoned in a system where a minority could think and act for everyone else, has just come to an inglorious end in the Soviet Union. This triumph of freedom over ideology is the most uplifting phenomenon of the end of the century.\nThe major changes taking place in all regions of the world are producing a new dynamic, a democratic thrust which consecrates the struggle for the dawn of a new order based on the interdependence of nations. The end of the East-West rivalry and confrontation, commonly called the cold war, has contributed to the emancipation of the nations of eastern Europe, the disappearance of the one-party system in many countries and the re-establishment of freedom of speech, an essential element of democracy.\nIn our country, the Comoros, democracy has been a reality since December 1989, when President Said Mohamed Djohar came to power. Since then major changes have been taking place in all areas of political, economic and social life. A multi-party system and freedom of the press have been restored. In brief, the Comoros is now gradually introducing republican institutions, the results of a collective initiative giving all citizens the ability to enjoy their rights, while being equally aware of their duties.\nHowever, for the State of law which we all so earnestly desire to become an irreversible reality and for our peoples to agree to abide by it fully and to be able to gain the benefits they have a right to expect, there must be support for this step in favour of democracy. There can be no viable democracy and political stability without economic progress.\nLike all the other African countries, we are aware that in order to find our way back to the path of growth and development we must above all invest in our own potential. We are also convinced that we can expect no significant improvement in the economic situation of our countries without leadership that rigorously complies with the rules of budgetary and fiscal orthodoxy in State finances. That is why, aware of its responsibilities, the Comorian Government has concluded with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank an agreement for a structural adjustment programme. That programme is already under way, but it goes without saying that without the support of our partners and of the international community our efforts may be in vain.\nWe note that international economic relations are still marked by inequitable relations between the North and the South. It is a revealing paradox that today the South is paying the North more than it receives from it.\nMoreover, in spite of the praiseworthy initiatives taken by some countries and the great deal of thought given to the subject by the international community, the debt problem has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. This seriously hinders any development. Similarly, the dialogue between the producer countries and the consumer countries must be reactivated to ensure that higher prices are paid for commodities.\nSpecifically in the case of Africa, the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development is coming to an end, and we cannot say that it has fully achieved the ambitious objectives set for it; nor has it met the legitimate expectations of the African people. This Programme is a prime example of an agreement concluded in good faith between our partners and ourselves on the basis of reciprocal commitments that were formally entered into. Today we must bear witness to the fact that, in the final analysis, the commitments entered into have not been fulfilled to any reasonable extent, since the economic crisis in most of our countries is getting worse rather than better.\nA final study of the implementation of the United Nations Programme for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 will be carried out in the course of the current session of the General Assembly. Certain important issues should be raised at that time and an in-depth analysis should be made of the consensus reached in 1936; its consequences for the specific results of the recovery and economic development; and the extent to which all parties to the historic alliance have honoured their commitments in this Programme.\nWe welcome the changes under way in the countries of the East, even if in some cases their new-found democracy was not easy to achieve. We believe that the end of the cold war will open up new prospects for international cooperation.\nThe fact remains that certain of our countries are, quite rightly, concerned by the focus on, if not diversion to, the countries of the East with respect to developmental aid from the rich countries. In saying this, we in no way wish to deny those countries their legitimate right to benefit from international support; we simply wish to express our concern, which in fact is not a new one, in the face of the growing disengagement of support vis-\u00e0-vis Africa. This is why we hope that structures similar to those set up for these countries might also be considered for our continent and for the South in general.\nIn southern Africa we are receiving encouraging signs every day, the prelude to a lasting peace in this region. Thus, in Angola, a country that had been in civil war since its independence, we can only praise the efforts made by President dos Santos and the leader of UNITA, Mr. Jonas Savimbi, towards the achievement of a fair, definitive agreement. He also express the hope that our immediate neighbours, the people of Mozambique, might finally be able to resolve their differences so that peace might reign in this long-suffering country.\nIn South Africa, since President De Klerk came to power, we have been witnessing the gradual dismantling of the inhuman apartheid system, thanks to the constant pressures that the international community has put on the South African regime.\nFurthermore, we are pleased that many South Africans of all races now agree that apartheid should give way to a new constitutional structure in their country. The draft constitution recently introduced by President De Klerk and his party is a foundation for serious negotiations and a step in the right direction.\nIt is in this context that we commend the agreement reached between the leaders of the two major parties, Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. Buthelezi, in order to put an end to the violence being committed between black communities. We fervently hope that this agreement will be complied with and applied effectively so that there might be an end to the internecine strife that has caused so much bloodshed and has retarded the ongoing process of democratisation.\nAs regards Western Sahara, we note with satisfaction that progress is being made towards a just and lasting solution to that problem. The situation in Liberia still remains very fragile. We do welcome the prospect, however, that the people of this wounded country might soon be able to choose their leaders through free, democratic elections, which will help to restore peace and national harmony.\nRegarding Haiti, we vigorously condemn the coup d'etat that recently ousted President Aristide, who was democratically elected by the Haitian people. We hope that the isolation of the putschist regime that has taken power in Port-au-Prince will force it to agree to the return of President Aristide in order to preserve peace and stability in that country.\nIn occupied Palestine, the Palestinian people continue to struggle against and courageously resist the repressive yoke of the Israeli occupation army. But not a week goes by, not even a day, without a Palestinian martyr falling, struck down by the real bullets of the Israeli army.\nAnd yet these terrible sufferings, experienced every day by these brave people, have today become almost a matter of course. In fact, the international media hardly speak of them anymore. Indeed, since last year, the Gulf War, events in the USSR and the collapse of communism have taken pride of place on the international scene.\nThe question of Palestine, unfortunately, has not found any sort of solution. It is now quite clear that nothing can deter the Palestinian people from fighting for their legitimate rights, rights that in fact are recognized by our Organization, including the right to a homeland. As long as this problem persists, there will be no peace, no stability and no security in the Middle East.\nIt is in this context that my Government supports the efforts of the American Government to convene a peace conference of the parties concerned, even though we would have preferred the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. Such a conference would deal with all unresolved problems in the region while respecting the pertinent resolutions adopted by our Organization and guaranteeing the right of all States in the region to live in security and peace.\nRegarding Korea, the Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros hopes for and supports the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. We hope that the high-level contacts that took place last year between representatives of the two Koreas will be continued and will result in a better understanding of each other and create the necessary conditions for peaceful solution to this problem. We are also pleased that the two Koreas, in accordance with the principle of universality of the United Nations, have decided to join the Organization as Members, which will help to strengthen security and international cooperation.\nIn South-East Asia, the problem of Cambodia seems to be coming out of a state of impasse and seems to be on its way to a peaceful solution. We make solemn appeal to all the parties concerned to take positive steps that might enable our Organization to put an end to this bloody, fratricidal conflict.\nI could not conclude wry statement without, referring. If only briefly, as this matter will soon be debated in the Assembly, to the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte. As members are aware, this painful problem, which has existed for 16 years, has yet to be solved satisfactorily, in spite of the relevant United Nations resolutions. At a time when the Organisation would seem to have regained its prestige, when its credibility has been restored and its decisions are being complied with, the Comorian people is entitled to expect a speedy solution to this problem in accordance with the desire of the international community and with United Nations resolutions.\nFrom this rostrum, I should like to reaffirm the determination of the Government and the people of Comoros to continue their tireless efforts to bring about the reintegration of the Comorian Island of Mayotte into the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros and its three sister islands.\nThe Government and the people of Comoros, strengthened by the fairness and appropriateness of their claim, and supported by the international community as a whole, are as always open to all paths leading to a peaceful solution, as part of the good relations that exist between France and Comoros, and in accordance with international law.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe events of recent years, and particularly events since the last session of the General Assembly, have categorically disproved the assertions of certain modern prophets who stated that we have reached the end of history. On the contrary, history continues to move forward, always with openness and constant renewal. Today's realities are the greatest proof of the irrepressible impetus of freedom and of the fact that men and peoples always succeed in breaking the chains of oppression.\nThe world is now crossing the threshold of a new era which is marked by an expanding democracy in the framework of an open, changing and endless process. The century which is coming to an end will be known as the century of renewal end the re-conquest of democracy. The fight for the ideals of democracy continues to be the great driving force of history. It is two world wars which radically transformed political forms and international structures which exist today were essentially, though not solely, confrontations between democracy and the forces of totalitarianism.\nWe are now witnessing events which may well lead to a new international order - an order related to the triumph of democracy. We may still not be able to talk about that new order, except in so far as it represents a verification of existing realities. If whatever lies ahead is to be a real order and not simply a manifestation of power, it will have to be characterised by scrupulous respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. There is no order outside the law and, at the same time, law is essential to preserve peace. These essential concepts of legal philosophy cannot be forgotten as we reflect on the present international situation.\nThe end of the cold war, the growing understanding among the great Powers, the political changes in Eastern Europe, the end of communism as a doctrine and its universal collapse as a political system, the consolidation of democracy in practically all of Latin America, the virtual end of the decolonisation process and the irreversible movement towards the elimination of apartheid - these are events heralding the possible birth of the new international order that we all desire, which will have to take root and be further developed over the next few decades.\nThe bipolar concept of the world is no longer valid as a basis for interpreting international political realities. The new international situation is being shaped through changes and events occurring with the kind of unpredictability that is characteristic of critical moments in human history and with the speed that is typical of the accelerating pace of history in our times.\nHowever, that process, which has positive elements, also has elements that could negatively affect the international balance, peace and security. Therefore, we see a strange juxtaposition of promise and danger, light and darkness.\nMankind must be given firm prospects of living in peace and prosperity. The present generation has the historic responsibility of laying down the ethical, legal and political foundations for the future. The first step is fully to recognise that responsibility.\nWhen we think about building a new international order we cannot think merely about new forms of the status quo or of a new distribution of power in the world. What we want is to ensure free coexistence among States on the basis of full observance of the principles of the Charter by all members of the international community.\nThe ban on the use of force, which entails respect for the key principle of non-intervention, will have to be regularly strengthened, as the cornerstone of international peace.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes between States is a rule that must always be followed, it being understood that solving or containing conflicts requires proper coordination of the actions of the United Nations and of regional bodies.\nThe principle of good faith in the fulfilment of international obligations must be not only an ethical precept and a legal commitment, but also an element of wisdom in the conduct of international relations.\nWe must jointly undertake to bring about the necessary universal respect for the principle of the self-determination of peoples, in harmony with other principles of international law, in such a way that it does not become an excuse for ethnic confrontation and divisive xenophobia. But the international community cannot, remain aloof if nothing succeeds in preventing confrontation between peoples who do not wish to live under a common State system and if hatred, violence and fighting become the main features of their relations. The international community must face up to such a situation and, in order to prevent its becoming a threat to international peace and security, take action to guarantee peaceful exercise of the right to self-determination.\nWith regard to the right to self-determination, I wish to express Uruguay's support for the peace plan for Western Sahara and to express our earnest hope that the referendum will take place and that its results will be accepted.\nThe heart-rending experience of the years preceding the Gulf crisis is clear proof that States must conduct themselves strictly in accord with the obligations deriving from the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nThe new international situation offers possibility of progress in International relations. I wish to address three issues of the greatest importance.\nThe first is the strengthening of the collective security system. The end of the cold war does not necessarily imply the end of reel possibilities of armed conflict. Though the danger of a global conflagration has diminished, there remain situations threatening peace and security.\nThe collective security system established by the Charter was not applied for more than 45 years, despite the fact that it was conceived as a key element in the organisation of the post-war world. It seems that only now are the assumptions on which the system of collective security was based becoming reality. The system assumes a political understanding between the permanent members of the Security Council. The absence of such an understanding paralysed the United Nations and made it impossible for the system to work.\nExperience in the Gulf crisis obliges us to maximise our efforts to ensure that the system operates with full respect for the Charter. The system must be organized in such a way that the competent organs of the Organization have effective control.\nIn this context, we cannot fail to refer to recent events in the Soviet Union. The interruption of the democratic process in the system there by the attempted unconstitutional coup d'etat would have had negative consequences internationally. The re-establishment of constitutional legality and the re-establishment of that process, which my country hails as the fruit of the people's courage and resolve, is at the root of the Soviet Union's contribution to peace and to the development of the collective security system. Uruguay supported the vigorous actions taken by the Security Council, beginning in August 1990, when it decided to take collective measures against Iraq's aggression, with a view to restoring rights that had been breached and re establishing international peace and security.\nThat support was given unhesitatingly, despite the material sacrifices it entailed for our economy, and it continues today, with Uruguay's decision to second members of its military forces to serve in the peace keeping operations in the region. Uruguay, which sustained economic damage as a result of the measures taken, invoked Article SO of the Charter to request the compensatory assistance to which it had. and has, a right. The implementation of Article 50 is essential for the future of collective security. It is necessary to adopt agreements regulating the obligation to grant assistance to third-party States that are affected.\nToday, after our experience, we have come to the General Assembly with the feeling that we have an exceptional opportunity to make the collective security system work, in accordance with the Charter. If there is one thing that makes this moment stand out in history, it is that this belief is universal, which compels us to think together and openly about the future use of the powers conferred on the Security Council in Chapter VII of the Charter.\nProportionality in the lawful use of force on the basis of Security Council decisions and strict application of International humanitarian law are examples of situations in which it is essential to avoid overstepping the limits of the measures provided in Chapter VII. Future world stability and its peace and security do not necessarily depend upon the proper functioning of the mechanisms for dealing with extreme circumstances, which inevitably require recourse to collective measures. Hence, there is need for multilateral preventive diplomacy, particularly on the part of the Secretary-General, which will enable the United Nations to supervise and contain situations of potential conflict.\nRegional conflicts, some of which are extremely serious, deserve special attention. Uruguay wishes to refer specifically to one of them, namely, that in the Middle East. It is necessary, through the holding of a peace conference, to move forward towards the establishment of peace and security in that critical region, ensuring the right of its peoples to live and organize themselves according to their own free will and the right of all States to exist and live side by side in an environment based on law, justice and cooperation.\nThe second key issue is the development of international law. During the United Nations Decade of International Law, it is appropriate to recall that the fundamental obligation of every State, and the only one that can ensure peaceful coexistence, is submission to the rule of law. We must avail ourselves of the new international situation to encourage the development of international law in every field. Disarmament law will benefit particularly from this favourable situation, Uruguay is hopeful that the new political climate will lead to general acceptance of existing treaties on arms control and arms reduction as well as to the adoption of and, more important, compliance in good faith with new treaties that will represent progress in this field.\nThe concentration of weaponry far beyond defence needs at both the world and regional levels contributes to an increase in mutual distrust. Measures related to disarmament, on the other hand, represent a contribution to pacification, reducing tensions and generating a climate of security.\nLast year significant progress was achieved in the limitation of strategic weapons as a result of agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union. A few days ago President Bush announced the unilateral destruction of all tactical nuclear weapons and made an offer of negotiations with the Soviet Union for the continued reduction of intercontinental strategic weapons. This process of reduction and limitation of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, which is obviously of interest and concern to the whole of the international community, must continue.\nLatin America has taken decisions aimed at consolidating the process of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. On 18 July of this year Argentina and Brazil signed a bilateral agreement in Guadalajara to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. For the fulfilment of that agreement both countries anticipate the application of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. They also reaffirmed their will to adopt measures to bring the Treaty of Tlatelolco into force. Uruguay applauds and supports that attitude.\nWe must also move forward resolutely in the field of the destruction of chemical, biological and other weapons of mass destruction. The Mendoza Declaration issued by Argentina, Brazil and Chile on 4 September 1991, to which Uruguay has also adhered, is of major importance.\nThe development of International law in accordance with present-day reality and the new order we want to establish covers many areas other than disarmament. The environment, drug trafficking, terrorism and international trade are some of the priorities. The development calls for a strengthening of the main legal organ of the United Nations, namely, the International Court of Justice. Among the many measures that might be undertaken in that regard, I would emphasise the importance of making greater use of the Court as a consultative body. That could be achieved if the General Assembly granted the Secretary-General the authority to request such opinions.\nWe turn now to the third key issues: international cooperation for development. The international economic scene, with its unequal and unfair distribution of wealth and opportunities, has shown itself impervious to the dynamics of change that have shaken the political order. International peace and security will never be assured as long as economic insecurity persists. Peace is not merely the absence of war. In a small and interdependent world the coexistence of two opposite worlds, that of abundance and waste on the one hand, and that of poverty and hunger on the other, will inevitably generate violence.\nGrowing wealth and growing poverty are the paradox of today's world. Poverty weakens the cohesiveness of societies; it destroys the foundation of human right s and perverts the environment. Hence the importance of social issues in development. It is necessary, therefore, to begin to prepare for the social summit that will be held within the next few years.\nThe absence of scientific and technological progress is one of the reasons for the winning of the gulf that separates the developed and the developing worlds. Technological progress is a key factor in the solution of\nNorth-South tensions and would be of benefit for the developed and industrialised countries. That is why Uruguay proposed the creation of a common market of knowledge, a project that is already under way at the regional level in the framework of the Organisation of American States. It should also be considered at the universal level.\nThe necessarily universal character of the United Nations means that all States of the world should be Members of the Organisation. The admission of both Koreas not only reaffirms that trend but reveals the possibilities that exist for solving a problem that constituted one negative aspect of international relations. Uruguay hopes that this dual admission will stand as a symbol of the will to strengthen the universality of the United Nations as an indispensable element in ensuring peace and security on a global level.\nThe admission of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, heartily supported by Uruguay, is the expression of the international recognition of the correct example of the right to self-determination and the ratification by history of the fact that the secret protocols of 1939 and the annexation of those Republics by force are null and void.\nThe entry of the Marshall Islands and Micronesia into the United Nations is a historic event that exemplifies the present stage of the historic process of decolonization undertaken by the United Nations.\nThe fundamental importance of the environment issue at a time when the Conference on Environment and Development: scheduled for Rio de Janeiro in 1992 la being prepared compels us to specify Uruguay's position on the matter. The question of the preservation of the environment and its relationship with development is a global issue which must be faced in all its aspects ethical, cultural, political, economic, social, technical and legal. The issue is global not only in itself, but also because of the need to face up to it with universal measures which go beyond national or sectoral outlooks. The progress of developing countries and the preservation of the environment are intimately and necessarily related issues. It would therefore be a mistake to try to solve the environmental crisis without paying due attention to economic and social problems, and the Rio Conference must reflect this relationship.\nUruguay joined the countries of the area in preparing the Tlatelolco platform - adopted last March - and the Guadalajara declaration, adopted by the Heads of State and Government of Ibero-America, Spain and Portugal; those are statements of positions, both political and technical, for the negotiations which will culminate in 1992. We are now at a critical stage, only 10 months away from Rio 1992. Uruguay believes that it is vital to prevent Rio from becoming just another Stockholm.\nThe general principles that will apply to environmental protection must be set out in the form of a convention. Apart from the conventions now being prepared we must have another, and not just a simple statement, which spells out the fundamental principles and criteria in this matter. The convention must set out criteria for setting up a legal system to resolve environmental disputes and judge offences or crimes by means of a specialised Judicial body or chamber. The bases on which responsibility for violating the duties inherent in environmental protection in to be implemented and the ways in which this may be done must be set out. Polluting emissions come mainly from developed countries, and they must bear the main responsibility for them. This responsibility may be common or shared, but we must not forget the consequences which a policy of uncontrolled industrialisation which wan totally foreign to the developing world has had, and for which the developing world cannot be held solely responsible. This implies that there must inevitably be a process of codification of International environmental law. The future charter of the Earth, to be adopted at the Rio Conference, must be a mandatory, legally binding document, with the goal of creating the necessary conditions for sustainable development and ensuring the right of future generations to life and well-being.\nDrug trafficking and terrorism, which are being shown to be closely linked, are continuing to exact a tragic toll in destruction and death, violating fundamental human rights and debasing the basic principles of civilized coexistence. To combat these two scourges effectively, every means international cooperation car provide must be used. Alongside the concern generated by the alarming expansion of the illicit use of drugs and the power of the drug dealers, it is encouraging to see how, through international cooperation, effective measures are being taken on the basis of shared responsibility between consuming and producing countries.\nFive years have passed since the launching of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este aimed at ending the waves of protectionism which are chipping away at trade. Last December, we believed we were at the end of the road towards an equitable agreement which would satisfy the legitimate aspirations of over 100 participating countries. Unfortunately, the meeting in Brussels, which I presided over as Chairman of the trade negotiating committee at the ministerial level, was a failure because it was not possible to conclude the Round. Fundamental differences on vital issues arose and, when the session was adjourned, the Director-General of GATT was entrusted with the task of carrying out consultations aimed at restarting negotiations as soon as possible.\nThe first half of 1991 has been devoted to getting the negotiations back on track. When the trade negotiating committee met, at the end of July, there was a renewed will to continue working from September on, with a view to finishing work by the end of this year. In this context, the commitment by the Heads of State or Government of the Seven at their London summit was very encouraging.\nThe Cairns group, of which Uruguay is a member, has already stated that the Round will not and successfully if a satisfactory solution concerning the liberalization of agricultural trade is not reached.\nWe are starting resolutely upon the last leg of the most important trade negotiations ever undertaken. We shall support anything that contributes to success. The Round must end in December with a positive outcome, with reasonable, globally balanced achievements. If it fails, we shall have to admit our shameful inability to achieve, in today's world, formulas that encourage free and non-discriminatory international trade, that banish protectionism and that become factors for vigorous development. Respect for and promotion of human rights is the basis for peace. So long as there is any place in the world where the dignity of human beings is not respected, so long as persecution and discrimination persist, so long as political rights are not recognised and guaranteed and so long as periodic, free elections are not held, the advancement of mankind will be impossible and the degree of economic, social and cultural development of individuals will be uneven. Human rights must be protected without discrimination, free of any element of political selectivity and on the basis of the strict application of international law.\nWe must banish from the United Nations all inaccurate descriptions based on hatred, such as the one which in 1975 mistakenly equated Zionism with racism, in General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX). Uruguay, which has always been against this infamous resolution and voted against its adoption, is now in favour of its repeal. The mistake of 1975 must be emended. By so doing, we shall pay a tribute to the truth, rectify an unfair and offensive judgement and contribute to the peace process in the Middle East.\nInternational democratisation has been translated into a global improvement of the world human rights situation. But the general picture is far from satisfactory. We are still faced with some atrocious realities. Very serious violations persist and armed conflicts, both domestic and international, continue to be a source of attacks on human rights and international humanitarian law.\nThe human rights situation must remain a priority issue for the United Nations. The principle of non-intervention cannot be a protective shield behind which human rights can be violated. But stating that plain truth does not mean repudiating the principle of non-intervention nor does it imply accepting a right of intervention based on a political and self-interested assessment by one or several States. This must not be confused with the collective duty, decided upon by legal means, to provide help and relief when serious emergencies arise in the field of human rights.\nUruguay is particularly interested in the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for 1993, which must make a major contribution to the full, general and universal application of human rights.\nTwo recent events in Central America deserve to be highlighted. Uruguay hails the agreements between Guatemala and Belize, as well as the agreement which paves the way towards peace in El Salvador, as truly major achievements.\nIn conclusion, I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the work he has done. His activities over the last year, brilliantly described in his report to the General Assembly, have made an exceptional contribution to peace, security and the future of the United Nations. He has earned the thanks of the international community.\nLast year the General Assembly had a productive session under the expert presidency of Foreign Minister Guido de Marco, whom I am pleased to congratulate on his work. This year we have momentous decisions to take at a difficult time, when we are faced with challenges requiring immediate solutions. The election of Ambassador Shihabi, with the experience ha has gained as the representative of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations, to guide our debates allows us to forecast another successful session. I am convinced that his skills and knowledge of international affairs, along with his keen sense of justice, will enable him to lead our work to a successful conclusion.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Republic of Panama is deeply gratified at the election of Mr- Samir Shihabi as President of the General Assembly, and we are confident that under his able guidance this forty-sixth session of the Assembly will be one of great importance for our Organization.\nThe work of his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, has laid the bases upon which to deal with the changes called for by the new international situation.\nMy people are very happy at the admission of the new Members. We have always maintained cordial relations with the Republic of Korea, and we now have the hope that the Korean peninsula will be reunified. The Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia are our neighbours of that Pacific Ocean which has linked us with Asia for so many centuries. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania constitute an example of faith and courage in regard to liberation, culminating in recognition by the international community. We are fully confident that at the next session of the General Assembly we shall have another new Member as a result of the plebiscite to be conducted in Western Sahara under the auspices of the United Nations to secure the right of self-determination for the Saharan people.\nA year ago, from this rostrum, I gave a brief account of the recent history of our Republic. The vicissitudes we have experienced can be understood only in the light of our internal reality, which quite often is ill understood in certain circles. On that occasion I sought to emphasize certain of the national values we treasure. Among these are our love for democracy, our commitment to human dignity and our devotion to individual freedoms. On the other side of the coin is our aversion to poverty, sectarianism and disease. In defence of those values, and in the struggle against those scourges, the Republic of Panama will always be prepared to contribute, with honesty and determination, not only domestically but also as a member of the world community.\nA year ago we were looking forward to the opportunity of enjoying an era of peace and cooperation between nations. Today we are beginning to build the road to a new society for mankind. Here, the relationship between the super-Powers could prove to be an effective instrument. We understand that this is a complex situation, but we observe that positive results have already emerged with regard to relations among States and the freedom of peoples. The changes in the Soviet Union, in Eastern Europe and in Asia give rise to optimism, and they should prompt us to cooperation. The international community understands this and is supporting the positive change. For the Republic of Panama, the establishment of diplomatic and consular relations with the Soviet Union is the door to a new and significant relationship on the eve of the twenty-first century.\nIt is in the framework of this flowering of freedom that we must confront the crises presented by national identities. Those crises are as understandable as were the divisions that ensued upon our independence from Spain in the last century. As part of greater Colombia, we lived through the dismemberment of a dream and the confinement of a continental vision. Today we are trying to recapture these, having paid the high price of fragmentation.\nAgainst this background, we view with concern and pain the struggles of Yugoslavia. We are aware of the roots of the ethnic problem but, at the same time, we harbour the hope that the centrifugal forces of development will overcome the fragmentationist forces of division, both in that country and in the emerging regions of Africa.\nPeace in the Middle East calls for a new tolerance between Israel and the Arab countries. A conference to examine the present situation and to help to overcome decades of enmity is essential. It is necessary not only for the region and for the peace of the planet but also for the sake of programmes aimed at the salvation of mankind and the defence of our environment. The surest road to a lasting peace is a negotiated solution that will satisfy the specific aspirations of all the peoples concerned.\nOur Government has closely followed political developments in southern Africa. We believe that a serious effort is being made to revise the apartheid system. The Pretoria Government has adopted significant measures that call for impartial study, taking into account the interests of the South African peoples. A solution should be sought that is more in tune with the present international situation.\nIf the political problems of Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are of unquestionable importance to us all, I wish to refer to two other obstacles that we must overcome in this Organization and within each State. I refer to the poverty of man and to the impoverishment of the environment. Poverty is making inroads every day. In the developing countries 1,000 million people are living in conditions of dire need. In South America and the Caribbean more than half the population is having difficulty surviving. In the developed countries, statistics conceal broad areas of human misery in the midst of apparently general wealth. The efforts of the United Nations to reduce poverty are worthy of praise and support. In our subcontinent the United Nations Development Programme and the regional projects concerning critical poverty help us to tackle the problem, but they are not sufficient. They must be supplemented with other measures of international cooperation.\nWe in Panama have adopted a set of measures in the framework of a national strategy to reduce poverty. These include projects over the next five years focusing on health, education, housing and employment, with the emphasis on programmes for mother-and-child nourishment, popular housing and job creation. The support of non-governmental organizations has been demonstrably important and constitutes a mechanism for extra-governmental participation without which the democratic process would be incomplete.\nWe shall ensure that next century's world is better than this one if we understand that we cannot create in one part of society wealth that is based on poverty in another part - either internationally or nationally. Relationships between North and South must change on the basis of mutual respect and acceptance of the just value that human labour deserves in every region. We need a new approach to the prices of our commodities. We need truly to expand international trade and investment. We need a generous vision concerning the use and distribution of wealth. This is a matter not of paternalism but of justice, for that reason it is Important that trade negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should not become bogged down, and it is vital that regional economic groups should not became so many more zones of protectionism.\nLast year I suggested that a decade against poverty should be declared with a view to checking the spread of poverty, disease and ignorance around the world. Today, in recognising the efforts of the United Nations in this noble endeavour, I insist that we move forward and that the new era of international cooperation should extend to the poor.\nWe are all concerned about the deterioration of the environment and about the harmful consequences that that may have for present and future generations. We Panamanians are doubly concerned because of our position, because of the nature of our natural resources and because of the impact that their deterioration would have for the planet, but especially for Panama.\nWe live between two seas united by a canal. The canal is at the same time a Panamanian resource and an instrument of world trade. Our fisheries encompass the Greater Caribbean and the Humboldt Current. We are literally the forward defence of Amazonia. Our Darien area has for several decades constituted a resource reserve of the first order. It is governed in the Pacific and Atlantic areas by organisations with the participation on an equal footing of all groups of indigenous peoples living there. They are represented at every level of Government, from local municipalities to the national Legislative Assembly.\nUpsetting the ecological balance in this area would affect fisheries in both oceans, the operation of the Canal and inter-ocean trade.\nMy Government placed these facts on record at the recent meeting in Madrid. I wish to state decisively before this body the urgent necessity of quantifying the value of those reserves for mankind. They should be taken advantage of by all equally, by those of the North and those of the South, so that the land may have neither owners nor exploiters.\nThe painful measures that we small countries are taking in this area call for the cooperation of the developed countries in both the technical and economic spheres.\nAware of the implicit danger for all mankind, we have adopted the measures recommended by this Organization concerning dumping and incineration of toxic and dangerous waste in the region of the Greater Caribbean. We have also taken special precautions in the transport of oil and other chemicals that pass through the Canal. We are committed to the protection of our water resources and especially the preservation of the hydrographic basin of the Canal.\nThe World Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, will be of decisive importance on this topic and Panama supports all measures to assure its success.\nThe military Government that preceded my own ceased to comply with the obligations of the State towards international organizations and other creditors. It had no other purpose than illicit enrichment and the waste of national capital. Thus, it neither paid the debts it had contracted nor encouraged the development of the economy.\nMy Government was obliged simultaneously to tackle unemployment, declining investments, an incomprehensible political hostility and the payment of the debt we inherited from the previous regime. Our efforts have in an orderly fashion produced some concrete results because our domestic economy is recovering. The fiscal situation is gradually becoming normalized. We have already achieved agreements with international financial bodies and with the countries of the Paris Club. Finally, we have prepared a programme of economic adjustment to free our economy within the plan of international cooperation, restructuring of debt and new plans for investment.\nOur decision gradually and in a complementary way to become part of the Central American group is based on the trend towards regional grouping. We are furthermore convinced that the countries of the area are moving in a democratic direction. We are proceeding cautiously, but our decision demonstrates a firm political will, We are aware of our function as a link to the South American continent, to which we are bound by centuries of relationships, and to a Caribbean area that has since colonial times been related to us by blood, customs and interests. \nThe Panama Canal is preparing to be Panamanian not only in name but in reality as of 31 December 1999. It should be stated in this body that, contrary to what is sometimes heard, the Republic of Panama is preparing itself responsibly for the administration of this national resource, which also constitutes a resource of mankind.\nIt has always been said to date that the land was ours and the capital belonged to the United States. The work conducted in the Culebra Cut at the cost of more than $200 million, which was necessary for several years, was paid for by the collection of tolls through the Canal; what amounts to the same thing, Panama has made the economic sacrifice implied by waiving that income from now until the year 2000. This participation is proof of our seriousness.\nMoreover, the Republic of Panama is working out a mechanism that will allow us to engage in cooperation with users so that the Canal can fulfil its double function as a national resource and as an international instrument. We hope to be able to submit an original plan at the second Ibero-American Summit at Madrid as a Panamanian contribution to the great community of peoples linked by the two great oceans.\nI have not forgotten that here a year ago I committed the Panamanian Government to the cause of freedom in our neighbouring country, Haiti. International determination and the Haitian will for freedom led to an historic election in which a humble citizen was constitutionally elected President.\nWe know what Haiti feels today. We know that a handful of arrogant soldiers are doing the same thing in Port-au-Prince that other arrogant soldiers did in Panama two years ago.\nWe are here to state clearly that a democratic government cannot permit, for whatever reason, the flouting of the popular will in this manner, not in Haiti, not in Panama not in any part of the world. All the statements about poverty, underdevelopment ox equality would be meaningless if we were to allow the will of the people freely expressed in exemplary elections to be defied, if we were to allow the heroes of Haitian freedom to he defeated by sophistry that has nothing to do with reality. \nI have left this point for the end of my statement because it has to do not only with the situation of a small Caribbean country; it also has a direct relationship with our efforts to restructure the United Nations and to create a new world order based on justice.\nHere we have heard applause for the statements of those who have advocated the supremacy of a fair international order over internal injustice. As recently as Monday, the King of Spain moved the Assembly when, on behalf of his ancient kingdom he said, and I quote, \\\"... human rights are not the internal problem of any country\\\".\nThe tragedy in Haiti is something known to all Ibero-Americans, as well as many Africans, many Asians and many Europeans. The enjoyment of freedom involves the commitment to defend everyone's freedom; otherwise we run the risk of excluding ourselves from civilized society.\nMy Government supports all necessary measures to restore constitutional order in Haiti. We would do the same in any other case; we accept no formal concessions that betray the will of the people.\nIn the Organization of American States, we have maintained an unequivocal position order that the tragedy that my country experienced in 1989 will not be repeated in any other country. The Organization of American States cannot fail in its duty to re-establish democracy in Haiti. This would endanger democracy in this continent and would undermine the existence of that organization.\nTherefore, the Panamanian delegation has consistently made clear its willingness to support any measure that could contribute efficiently and effectively to the restoration of democracy in Haiti. I am not upholding a false concept of the principle of non intervention, for sovereignty is founded on the self-determination of a people, not that of any Government. I note with pleasure that on the initiative of the Latin American and Caribbean Group the General Assembly will shortly be considering a resolution expressing the concern and solidarity that our peoples and Governments feel for Haitian democracy.\nIt is customary for the President of Brazil to open the general debate. Today, for the first time, a Head of State will close it. It is significant that, following a large country, a small one like ours should make the final statement. Humanity is not a question of size. We have the Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland and Japan as timeless reminders of the strength of the small countries.\nOn behalf of my Government and all the peoples who have benefited from his constant concern for the peace and well-being of all nations, I wish to pay a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. He has courageously taken up the reforms of the Organization. He has left the proof of his dedication and his ability in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Cambodia, Cyprus and Central America, to mention only a few places. Panama offers him, as always, all its support, so that the record may show that we recognize his life as one devoted first to the service of his country and then to the service of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe sequence of events which recently shook the world is clear evidence that ultimately the process of democratic change cannot be reversed. The democratic concepts and values that are now sweeping the world are recognized as the most important unifying forces on this planet and the only reliable basis for justice, equality, prosperity and peaceful coexistence. Indeed, it is the universal acceptance of the dynamics of the process of democratisation that justifies the current wave of expressions of expectations for a better future.\nIn this context we wish to share with members the lessons learned in our short history as an independent nation and to highlight, as a responsible member of the family of nations, what contributions the people of Suriname are making to the new hopes of the international community.\nAfter a sad and unexpected interruption of the democratic process in my country, which had gained new momentum in 1987, the people of Suriname have again - through a free expression of their will in general elections this year - demonstrated their unswerving belief in democracy. In a peaceful manner and with dignity our people have repeated their determination to remain in the ranks of those who have pledged to make every necessary sacrifice to put an end to the era of authoritarian and totalitarian rule.\nThe people of Suriname have experienced the value and impact of international solidarity. In organising our renewed expressions of freedom and democracy we have received inestimable encouragement and political support. On this memorable occasion we wish to express our appreciation and sincere gratitude to all individuals, organizations - among others the Organisation of American States and the European Community - and sympathetic Governments and peoples that supported us during our long and arduous reorientation to democracy. I wish to repeat here that we shall always remember all fellow-countrymen who gave their lives in our guest for freedom, justice and democracy, or who lost their lives in the performance of their duties.\nWe have built a bridge to the new world and have helped to tear down the barriers that have hampered international communication and retarded progress, for we have learned that the democratic road is the most effective means to remove physical borders and to establish a world in which genuine interdependence will dominate over narrow-minded chauvinism; where confrontation will make way for tolerance and dialogue; and where cultural and social differences will not discourage cooperation to overcome ethnicity and senseless rivalry.\nThus through the unconquerable determination of the Surinamese people to choose constitutional democracy, we expressed an important goal of our foreign policy, namely to improve and deepen relations with other nations. It is in this context that we attach great importance to internal and external provisions for the promotion and protection of democracy in each country of every continent. Within the shortest possible time, therefore, the Constitution will be amended, making it a better reflection of the will and aspirations of our people with regard to the supreme role of the civil authority.\nBut a democratic society must be safeguarded; it requires, among other things, a sound economic base and the support of other democratic nations. We must, therefore, consider all suggestions made to organise regional mechanisms which would assist vulnerable emerging democratic countries in defending democracy whenever the need arises, with due adherence to the principle of self-determination.\nTo adapt our economy to changing international realities, and thus secure the basis for sound economic growth and safeguard the principle of social justice, my Government is committed to realizing a multidimensional adjustment and recovery programme. The solution to the dilemma that arises from the conflicting priorities of adjustment and stability, necessitates a prudent approach, while international support is indispensable. To this end my Government will shortly enter into dialogue with friendly nations inside and outside our region.\nMr. President, my delegation is pleased to see you, a representative of Saudi Arabia, a country with which Suriname enjoys friendly relations and cultural ties, presiding over the proceedings of the General Assembly. You bring to this office a wealth of diplomatic experience and skill. We wish you every success in the performance of your task and offer our unswerving support at all times. My delegation would like to convey its gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, for the excellent manner in which he guided the affairs of the forty-fifth session. During his tenure of office the Organization engaged in a process aimed at enhancing the role of the United Nations in international affairs and decision-making and took one of the momentous decisions in its history. We also express appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the excellent manner in which he too carried out his task in the recent turbulent period.\nThe admission of new nations is completely in conformity with the cherished goal of universality which is enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.\nThe membership of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will certainly contribute to a peaceful solution of the Korean question and my delegation wholeheartedly welcomes them as full Members of the United Nations.\nThe Government and people of Suriname also congratulate and welcome the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federal State of Micronesia and we rejoice at the admittance of the Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - into the United Nations. Their presence among us today as Members of this Organization is a reflection of sweeping changes that are taking place in today's world. The Government of Suriname looks forward to cooperation with all the new Members. We wish to reconfirm that we will continue to base our relations with other nations on the Charters of the United Nations and the Organisation of American States and on the principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned States.\nLong historical bonds have forged special relationships between Suriname and many other countries. Moreover, there exist special cultural ties with some countries, among them the Netherlands. This relationship is nurtured and strengthened by the relatively large group of Dutch citizens who originate from Suriname, and by the Agreement for Development Cooperation, signed between the Republic of Suriname and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nI expect that my Government, which was chosen by general, free and fair elections, will receive the fullest support and cooperation in realizing its national goals.\nSuriname hopes and expects to find a favourable attitude with the Netherlands and among all friendly nations, both within and outside our region. With regard to the Netherlands, the Government of Suriname has declared its preparedness to have further talks in the near future on the possible deepening and extension of relations between the two countries.\nNow that the traditional causes of international tension and instability have been removed, practically every country is challenged by a phenomenon so pervasive that it defies national boundaries, so persistent that the fight against it devours many national treasuries and, indeed, so devastating that it threatens to destroy the very essence of civilized man. It is no wonder, therefore, that Suriname, too, is among the victims of the evil and illicit trafficking and use of drugs. No one country alone can win the war against the scourge - certainly not small countries with a vulnerable economic base. Decisive and coordinated actions are called for, both at the regional and at the global level.\nWe have begun, within the limits of our resources, to take action in this regard at the national level. My Government will strengthen our institutional framework and seek the most effective manner in which to contribute to the war against drugs. We have already signed treaties with neighbouring countries for effective cooperation but we are convinced that, with the restoration of democracy in Suriname, we have met one of the basic requirements for expanded and intensified international cooperation.\nThe signing of the strategic arms reduction agreement by the United States and the Soviet Union constitutes a major step in achieving general and complete disarmament and will certainly contribute to a more stable and peaceful world. The process of arms reduction and disarmament, including the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, should be pursued vigorously. Serious consideration should be given to utilizing the substantial resources released as a result of detente, in a more constructive manner.\nWe note with much satisfaction that the processes of change in Eastern Europe have retained their dynamics. These processes, which are taking place with great difficulty, have our full support and sympathy. We are glad that the threat to the democratic forces in the USSR by means of a coup d'etat, was of but short duration. We commend the Soviet people for their courage, which was undoubtedly the decisive factor.\nWe had sincerely hoped that after the rapprochement of the super-Powers, the world in general, and Europe in particular, would have entered an era of peace and security. The ethnic confrontation taking place in Eastern Europe, however, fills us with deepest anxiety. We call upon the parties involved to seek a solution for their differences by means of dialogue and not by force of arms.\nOne of the fundamental causes of instability in the Middle East is the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian issue. My Government notes with appreciation the efforts made by the Government of the United States to promote the convening of a peace conference. We hold the view that a just and comprehensive solution is not possible without taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We support the right to security of all States of the region, including the State of Israel.\nThe positive changes taking place in South Africa are a source of hope and my Government welcomes the repeal of the main legislative principles of the apartheid system. However, pressure should be maintained until a democratic constitution has been established and all conditions as stipulated by the United Nations Declaration on South Africa have been met.\nThe development strategies of the 1970s and 1980s showed both their merits and their defects. Significant economic and social progress was made, particularly with respect to improving living conditions. However, millions of people in the world continue to live in poverty and ignorance, endure hunger, suffer from diseases, and die at an early age. The pressure of population growth over the next 10 years as well as the social side-effects of global restructuring will most certainly add to the existing problems of the developing countries. This paints a gloomy picture and in today's increasingly interdependent world, developed and developing countries have to address the needs of the people in a spirit of shared responsibility.\nThe challenge of combating backwardness, alleviating poverty and redressing social inequalities should be tackled through global cooperation. In this respect it should be noted that, fortunately, the emphasis at present is focused on human development and areas like primary education, preventive health care and housing.\nInternational cooperation for development has now reached another phase. We have learned from experience, and in this respect a new approach is being taken by the developing countries. This was reflected in the adoption of the agreed objectives of the Fourth International Development Strategy and in the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation.\nBut it is disappointing that thus far little progress has been made to achieve the objectives agreed upon during the negotiations of the relevant United Nations initiatives. Problems such as the external debt, reverse transfer of resources from developing to industrialized countries, and new forms of protectionism still constitute serious constraints in the development process. It should be noted, however, that despite these setbacks, the concept of development has given way to new perceptions which advocate greater cooperation for development and are geared towards shouldering of more responsibilities by the developing countries.\nWe support the views expressed in the report of the South Commission that the developing countries should rely increasingly on their own resources and efforts for economic development, without isolating themselves from the North. Therefore, we should promote South-South cooperation and encourage all efforts to strengthen our collective self-reliance as a matter of priority.\nMy Government underlines the South Commission's six-point global programme of immediate action and urges that in the near future serious consideration be given to convening a global summit meeting to discuss the objectives stated in the South report with the leaders of the North.\nSince the establishment of the United Nations, it has had to cope with many challenges, uncertainties and frustrations, but has also experienced success and achievements in many fields. Recent events have focused attention once more on the role and functioning of the Organisation. The Gulf war has demonstrated that the United Nations is able to take decisive action to repel aggression and restore international peace and security. We hold the view that in future the effectiveness of the Organisation could be augmented even more. To that end, the Security Council should act with the same vigour and unanimity, whenever international peace and security are in jeopardy, that it demonstrated during the Gulf war.\nIn this respect, my Government concurs with the view, recently underlined by the Secretary-General, that there should be a proper balance between the powers, prerogatives and responsibilities of the five permanent members of the Security Council and those of the 10 non-permanent, members and between the Security Council and the General Assembly.\nIn the first part of this year the General Assembly devoted considerable attention to finding ways and means to improve the functioning of the intergovernmental machinery in the economic and social fields of our Organization. My Government is of the opinion that the current process of reform should be continued, with the aim of enhancing the principle of democracy in the decision-making process of the United Nations. As the Group of 77 his stressed time and again, clarity and openness must be preserved and Strengthened; only then will the United Nations system be able to become more responsive and accountable to all Member States. We are moving towards the year 1992, which will be a year of special significance for the world. It will give us the opportunity to reflect on the time-span of 500 years of development which has passed since the first encounter of two continents. The year 1992 will also mark the beginning of new challenges and opportunities for present and future generations. Europe is setting course for a fully integrated economic system. At the same time, other regions too are moving towards strengthening their economic integration.\nHowever, the unifying process in Western Europe has been accompanied by concern on the part of the developing countries, particularly the African. Caribbean and Pacific (APC) countries, which have developed a close economic exchange with Europe throughout the years. The fear that this process will cause severe suffering for these countries is related to the fact that they cannot risk any further imbalances in their current economic situation. Due consideration should be given to their established legitimate interests.\nA United Europe after 1992 might indeed widen the gap between North and South, but it could also deepen the awareness of the countries of the world, both rich and poor, of their ever-increasing interdependence, which should strengthen their sense of mutual responsibility. In this respect, we express our sincere hope that the Uruguay Round, which will offer a solid basis for constructive cooperation in the field of multilateral trade negotiations, will be brought to a successful end.\nWe should approach in the same spirit the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, scheduled to be held in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, which will be a critical landmark in the history of the world. As the underlying causes of the environmental deterioration are being identified and the preparedness to combat them has become a priority on the international agenda, the need to take effective measures to achieve sustainable development is a matter of great urgency. The transfer of new and additional resources to finance environmental programmes in the developing countries, as well as environmentally sound and efficient technologies, is imperative. Suriname is looking forward to this important undertaking of the United Nations next year, which should offer the world a new framework for rights and obligations to be shared by mankind in the interest of the future of the entire world.\nWe have noted that the universal mood for democratic change is irrevocable and basic to any degree of economic progress and social justice. Failure to utilise this momentum to solve the most serious problems that afflict mankind and continue to dominate our agenda will take us to another age of despair. But the new respect and expanded role that our Organization has gained justifies our confidence and optimism. The Republic of Suriname is ready to take its share of the burden and make its contribution to steady and lasting progress in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset I wish to convey to Ambassador Shihabi my warmest congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, and to wish him every success in carrying out his high and responsible duties. It is a source of satisfaction that an experienced diplomat of such high calibre and distinguished qualities has been elected to this prestigious post. The fact that the President comes from Saudi Arabia, a country so close to the hearts of all Muslims, has a special significance for us.\nI should like also to express our appreciation for the valuable services of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Guido da Marco of Malta, in successfully guiding the affairs of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nThe Republic of Afghanistan sincerely congratulates the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia on joining the community of nations. It should be pointed out that our country was among the first officially to recognize the independence of the Republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.\nMy visit to Haw York and my presence in this Hall are not in pursuance of the established tradition of utilizing this world rostrum to promote and publicize Government and State policies. I appear here in the name not only of a Government but also of a nation, a nation which for 13 years has been burning in the flames of war. That war has posed a grave danger to the spiritual and physical existence of our nation. \nDuring those fateful 13 years my country, Afghanistan, has been dragged into the abyss of a conflict so wild and merciless that it has sent one tenth of its valorous and patriotic people to annihilation and another one third into a miserable life of exile. This conflict has plundered Afghanistan's cultural values and heritage and wasted its material wealth to the value of the labour and money invested over the past 50 years in social and economic development. Above all, the fabric of our society and our national unity, the products of thousands of years of coexistence between inseparable elements of our people and of their common struggle to safeguard the independent national identity of the Afghans, have been subjected to a dangerous game.\nWhy has a nation that lived by the toil of its hands and the sweat of its brow - a nation that bowed to none but its Creator and harboured animosity towards none - suffered such a terrible destiny? Who is responsible for all the sufferings of the Afghan people? What are the reasons behind all those miseries? He must accept that responses to these questions vary. Some consider that awful poverty, the socio-economic policies of previous Governments and Afghanistan's unbalanced reliance on one of the world's blocs are the main factors. Others blame the sensitive strategic and geopolitical location of Afghanistan and the cut-throat competition of the cold-war Powers and their regional allies for the expansion of their spheres of influence. The degree to which these and other factors influenced the situation may vary. But what is certain is that the fingers of accusation and blame point in more than one direction.\n\nThe main question now is this: is it now the time for us to bring each of the relevant factors before the tribunal of history and to sit in judgement, measuring and apportioning the extent of their respective roles and responsibilities? Alas, not yet.\nHow can one deny that the bulk of the documents and evidence related to external and internal developments concerning Afghanistan since April 1978 are still being kept confidential? How can one claim that the Afghans and the world public have full knowledge of all the facts as they were, not as they were portrayed? Are we in a position impartially and fairly to evaluate and analyse the events and their implications or to judge whether the continuation of the present situation makes it inevitable that new factors will emerge to protract the bloodshed?\nI sincerely believe that under the present circumstances no one can say the final word on the actual reasons for and causes of the bloody adventure in our country, and that no one has the moral right to delay an early end to the crisis on that pretext.\nConsidering the interests of the Afghans and the dominant world trends, narrow-minded and revanchist notions and attitudes must be set aside. Instead, we must find a solution that will promote the salvation and the good of the Afghans and further the interests of regional and world peace and stability. There can be no doubt that this must be a peaceful political solution in conformity with humanism and the ethics of civilized man, with Afghan traditions and with Islamic teachings and tenets. The use of force and the settlement of problems through war have become rejected and abhorrent. Notwithstanding the pain and wounds of the afflicted body and soul of the\npatient people of Afghanistan, there Is no reason to doubt the futility of attempts to gain military superiority.\nFurthermore, some of the important reasons for the emergence and aggravation of the Afghan problem either have ceased to exist or have been downgraded. The principles and foundations of cold-war-era international relations have been drastically altered, and the bloodstained arenas of East-West rivalry have become more and more limited. Two years have now passed since Soviet troops left our country: there have been considerable transformations in Afghanistan's State policies, functions and legal, political and economic structures. Similarly, there have been palpable changes in the composition of the parties to the conflict and in the policies of their allies. Afghans - each of whom has lost at least one dear one - have grown fed up with the destructive and fratricidal war. Nor is the world prepared any longer to provide money and weapons for Afghans to kill Afghans. Those changes, which result from the new way of thinking at the world level and from the policy of national reconciliation within our country, have provided conditions conducive to ending our people's pain and hardship. \nMy Government assumed the heavy responsibility of administration and received the vote of confidence of the Parliament at one of the most sensitive and critical junctures of our country's history. However, I have not hidden the fact that the main mission of my Government, as a government of national accord, is to help facilitate the task of transition towards the establishment of an elected new government in conformity with the aspirations of the vast majority of the Afghan people. Therefore, it is not accidental that two thirds of the present cabinet members are influential, non-partisan personalities and experienced technocrats trained in the West.\nI must state clearly that in the present conditions of our country only an insane person can cultivate the feelings of ambition and lust for power. But what has compelled me and my colleagues to shoulder the heavy and exhausting burden of government is our recognition of the awesome responsibility which lies before us and all other patriotic Afghans for the destiny of our downtrodden people.\nWe know that in the present circumstances no government has the right to claim that it enjoys the support of all Afghans. But this fact can in no way deny us the right to serve all segments of our people. We consider this not only as our right but also as our humanitarian obligation and our patriotic and Islamic duty. We have earnestly taken it upon ourselves to serve as an instrument of conciliation and compromise among the Afghan warring factions of the Government. Hence, we have adopted policies which place the supreme national interests of Afghanistan above all partisan, ideological, tribal, linguistic and religious considerations. We believe that peace has become the highest aspiration and the most urgent need of our people. Therefore, we consider it our honourable and immediate duty to strive for the fulfilment of that aspiration. But we can accomplish this mission successfully only if there is a real will and determination to bring about the cessation of war and the establishment of peace on the part of all effective forces of Afghan society. Such a determination could convincingly be demonstrated only by the practical readiness for the commencement of negotiations among the main parties concerned. In defiance of Afghan and world public opinion, unfortunately, some circles still harbour unrealistic hopes of achieving military supremacy, hopes which impede the commencement of intra-Afghan dialogue that could serve as a key for solving other problems.\nHow can one claim to be a proponent of peaceful, political settlement and, at the same time, refrain from holding negotiations with the main parties? Afghans throughout history have preserved the innocent name of Afghans and have lived honourably as a united whole, fraternally and with independence of judgement. Afghans have a common home; in order to salvage it from the scourge of war, they should unite and find a sound formula. If we Afghans in the peace process, we shall commit a mistake as grave as those who wish to negate the role of Afghans inside the country. The defeat of repeated military efforts is indicative of certain hard and objective realities which should be recognized and properly understood.\nThere is no doubt that the supreme interests of the nation will provide a solid and firm basis for conciliation and harmony among the conflicting realities. We fully understand that the years of confrontation and the ensuing suffering have created a wide gulf of mistrust and hard feelings among the sides. But the present and future interests of the country and of its people make it absolutely necessary to put aside feelings of vengeance and revenge. To attempt to settle scores and embark on a vendetta would result in a vicious circle. Mutual courage, graciousness and forgiveness are required to reduce the deep sorrow of yester-years in anticipation of the happiness and tranquillity of the morrow and to heal the psychological and physical injuries of our devout people with the balm of national accord and unity.\nThe Government of the Republic of Afghanistan has made serious and sincere efforts to eliminate the reasons and causes of disagreements and to endeavour to bring ever closer the positions of the sides.\nThe following statement was made in continuation of several proposals offered by Kabul on a political settlement on the seventy-second anniversary of the country's independence:\n\\\"We are in favour of direct, face-to-face and unconditional talks with opponents of the State of the Republic of Afghanistan, because setting prior conditions would result in delaying the talks. The process of negotiations with a number of opposition groups continues at different levels, while other opponents still have reasons which prevent them from holding direct negotiations. We propose that talks between the representatives of the Republic of Afghanistan and the opposition groups take place in the presence of neutral third parties. In other words, the Republic of Afghanistan is prepared to negotiate with the opposition groups through the mediation of the United Nations or of the countries interested in the Afghan problem.\\\"\nThe Afghan president, in reaction to the United States-Soviet joint declaration last week, proposed as a first step the enforcement of a cease-fire throughout Afghanistan and the commencement of talks between the State and the Council of the Internal Mijahideen Commander, leader of the parties and groups based in Peshawar and Tehran, the former king and his followers, and Afghan intellectuals living in Europe and America. \nAfghanistan is a traditional society. In Afghanistan people hold their aged and elderly in high esteem. In the present conditions when the flames of war are ablaze in the country, our people expect their elders, wherever they may be - among them His Majesty Mohammed Zaher Shah, the former king of our country - to take an active part in extinguishing this fire. We know that all Afghan personalities abroad are also concerned about their country, but as a proverb goes in the Pashtu language, \\\"The ground burns where the fire is set\\\". The country and its people are awaiting them. Silence and indifference in the present situation would be an unforgivable sin.\nFrom this authoritative world rostrum, I wish to communicate to the Assembly and to the people of the world the silent cry of the millions of tired and war-ridden Afghans whose lives have become a dreadful nightmare. The international community, and in particular the permanent members of the Security Council, should recognize their moral responsibilities in the face of the disaster in Afghanistan by making use of the mechanism provided in the Charter of the United Nations and lay the groundwork for negotiations and a political settlement. Silence and indifference in the face of this tragedy of blood, tears and fire would reflect a lack of conscience and an abandonment of moral responsibility. Such inaction should not continue. \nHere I wish to express the appreciation and gratitude of the people and Government of Afghanistan for the serious and untiring efforts of His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary-General of the United Nations and his personal representative, Mr. Benon Sevan, in helping to achieve a peaceful political settlement of the Afghan problem.\nThe Secretary-General's statement, which contained the five main elements of a political settlement of the Afghan problem, represents the international consensus and was supported by the Republic of Afghanistan and all interested countries. These documents guarantee the preservation of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, the right of the Afghan people freely to choose the political and socio-economic system of their country and other values on which all Afghans are in agreement. The Secretary-General's statement takes into account the nature of the Afghan conflict and contains elements of a comprehensive, practicable, just and honourable settlement for all the warring parties. These qualifications make it possible to achieve a national accord around the Secretary-General's statement, an understanding that has emerged among the concerned external parties. One of the salient elements of the statement is that, at the end of the transition period and peace process, the basic need of car people, namely, security, stability, democracy and development will be ensured. \nI urge this great assembly of nations to utilize its moral authority and prestige to call upon all the Afghan parties and the governments concerned to take steps towards implementing the Secretary-General's statement and to begin negotiations to that end without any further delay. I strongly believe that in the warmth of the national unity of the Afghans and world solidarity, the ice of misunderstanding and hard feeling will break and, by virtue of their traditions of thousands of years, the Afghans will find peaceful ways and means of settling their problems and will embark on rebuilding their ruined country. Our sisters and brothers who are away from their homes and hearths will return to their relatives and friends; all Afghans will join hands and adopt a socio-political order that will regulate their interactions with the government of the State in accordance with their own wishes. \nI believe that if we put aside' the personal interests of a few in the Afghan plain, and curb the illegitimate influence and hidden intentions of certain circles in some countries, the remaining differences are not so substantial as not to admit o\u00a3 a solution. \nThe joint declaration of the United States Secretary of State Mr. James Baker and the Soviet Foreign Minister Mr. Boris Pankin at the end of their talks on Afghanistan in Moscow is in fact a gigantic step towards removing one of the barriers in the way to ensuring peace in our country. We strongly hope that this constructive position on the part of the two guarantors of the Geneva accords will receive the practical support and cooperation of other involved countries.\nWe also hope that the recent visit of the Secretary-General to Teheran and Riyadh and his discussions with the leaders of Iran. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and with the two Mujahideen leaders, namely. Hasrat Saheb Sebghatullah Mujaddidi and Jenab Pir Saheb Sayed Ahmad Gailani may bring an added impetus to the peace efforts and prepare the ground for negotiations on the launching of a transition process. In the course of my visit to the Secretary-General, we discussed all practical and logical options and possibilities towards that end.\nAfghans have repeatedly proved that they will not hesitate to sacrifice their personal interests for the sake of the supreme interests of their country; but they will not allow others to take advantage of the present-day problems of the Afghans in order to impose their hidden intentions upon them. Afghans, whether inside or outside their country, are extremely sensitive about their national interests and will not accept any interference in, or infringements upon, their internal affairs.\nWe hope and expect that the United Nations will take some new initiatives for political settlement and devise, through consultations between Afghans, a vengeance and vendetta, in line with the Secretary-General's statement.\nWe are not speaking here about the so-called rights of minorities. Residents of Afghanistan are Afghans and Muslims. In fact, the question of minorities, as perceived in the political literature of other countries, is irrelevant in the case of Afghanistan; what should lie at the centre of our thoughts and actions is the need to ensure and safeguard the human rights of all citizens of Afghanistan regardless of their previous affiliations and deeds.\nThe transition mechanism must guarantee this matter in a comprehensive and reliable manner. I urge all peace-loving nations of the world that, while continuing their endeavours towards a peaceful end to the Afghan conflict, they should also provide generous assistance to our people with a view to eradicating the sad and grim consequences of the war from the life of the present generation throughout the country.\nOur people long for peace, but they also need food, medicine, fuel and other basic items. Our country is rich in natural resources and its people are hard-working, but the monster of war has limited the possibility of their proper utilisation. Once peace is restored, there is no doubt that large-scale resources will be diverted from the war budget towards meeting the needs of the people and exploiting our natural wealth to ensure their prosperity. However, we cannot and, surely, must not wait for peace to come to solve some of those problems, such as the severe shortage of fuel and food supplies.\nAfghans are patriotic, religious, theistic, brave, proud and peace-loving people. They wish to strengthen friendly ties and all-out cooperation with their neighbours and all countries of the world on the basis of the recognized principles of international law. In so far as they devotedly safeguard their national interests and honour, they also pay tribute to the rights and legitimate interests of other nations. They want to live in peace among themselves and with all nations of the world and to be the enemy of none and the friend of all.\nOur country is in favour of having good relations with Pakistan, as a co-religionist, neighbouring country. We are always prepared to negotiate with Pakistan about ways and means to invigorate our friendship and bilateral cooperation. I fully believe that this very aim is in conformity with the interests of the two nations and the whole region.\nWe have historic common ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The common language, culture, customs and our common religion have strongly linked us to each other. We have wide-ranging opportunities to expand mutual cooperation. We recognize Iran as a big country with influence over the changes taking place in the region. We wish to promote and develop our friendship and our mutually beneficial cooperation with Iran.\nWe also regard the People's Republic of China as a major neighbouring country; in the past and in the present, China, as a friend of the people of Afghanistan, has greatly contributed to our country's economic projects, such as the Parwan irrigation project, the Bagrami textile mill in Kabul, the 300-bed hospital in Kandahar and so forth. Today, past limitations in Sino-Afghan relations have been done away with. Our journalists, sportsmen and private entrepreneurs travel to China, and a noticeable improvement is evident in the two countries' relations, which is according to the wishes of the two nations.\nWe are sure of our ever-growing traditionally friendly relations and\neconomic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the Republic of India, which have always assisted the Republic of Afghanistan in its efforts to achieve peace in the country.\nThe people of Afghanistan attach special importance to their relations with Saudi Arabia, as a big Islamic country where the Muslim sanctuary is located. The house of the Lord and the holy shrines of Mohammed, the great prophet of Islam, and of the Caliphs have drawn our Muslim people to that land for hundreds of years. We wish that our Saudi brothers would not only respond favorably to our call for a normalization of relations with Afghanistan but would also make use of their moral influence and significant role in order to restore peace in Afghanistan.\nThe peoples of Afghanistan and Turkey are traditional friends to one another. We hold in high esteem the memory of our genuine cooperation with Turkey through tens of educational, cultural, medical and defence projects. The Government of Afghanistan will make use of every opportunity to expand and further develop friendship and cooperation between the two countries.\nOur ties with Syria have always been friendly, and the efforts of the Governments of the two countries to extend bilateral cooperation are convincingly increasing.\nKuwait, which has recently put a tormenting page in history behind it, has always been a friend of our country. We are seeking necessary avenues to promote out mutually beneficial cooperation with Kuwait.\nLong ties of friendship and cooperation closely link the peoples of Afghanistan and Egypt. I believe that our endeavours to strengthen and develop the traditional relations between the two countries will achieve a desirable outcome.\nAfghanistan strives equally strongly to develop good relations and mutually beneficial cooperation with other Arab and Islamic countries, relying upon the principles of the international law.\nNormal and friendly relations with the United States of America are in our national interests and are very important to our people. The many manifestations of our multilateral economic, scientific and cultural cooperation with the United States include such projects as Helmand valley, the Kabul-Kandahar highway, Kabul university establishments, the academic affiliation system and the training of hundreds of Afghans in specialised fields in United States educational institutions. These are well appreciated in our country and evince the solid and friendly relations between our peoples. We hope the United States Administration will take the hand of cordial friendship that we have extended and will move towards the normalisation of relations with Afghanistan.\nSwitzerland, to which our country has been compared by some tourists and historians, has had a special interest in the destiny of the people of Afghanistan. The latest instance of this was the innovative visit of Mr. Kiaus Jacobi, State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of that country, to Kabul and the surrounding region. This visit was aimed at helping to establish understanding and peace between the conflicting parties. We are sincerely grateful to Switzerland for this bold act.\nWe also desire ever broader relations with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria and other West European countries, as well as Canada and the United States. Each of these countries has assumed a noteworthy role in the socio-economic development of Afghanistan, which is recalled by our people with deep gratitude.\nEven during the very hard years of war, we maintained commercial relations with Japan, the Republic of Korea and other countries of South-East Asia and the Far East. The restoration of peace establishes more propitious circumstances for the association of Afghanistan with the economic foundations of this region. In line with its economic policy, the Republic of Afghanistan reiterates its demand for membership in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and is prepared to set up suitable economic associations with neighbouring countries.\nAttracting foreign investment constitutes an integral part of my Government's economic policy. Afghanistan stands ready to provide legally guaranteed facilities for foreign investments from countries throughout the world, without discrimination, in such varied fields as banking, air and land transportation, industry, construction, communications, the exploration and extraction of mines, the establishment of agricultural and livestock farms, irrigation systems, energy-generating complexes, and so on.\nAs one of the founders of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the Republic of Afghanistan wishes further to promote and strengthen its friendly relations with the members of the Movement and OIC, and will strive to achieve their common ideals. Together with other countries, we will make our contribution to increasing and upgrading the role of the United Nations in settling global issues and safeguarding world peace, as well as implementing the objectives of the United Nations Charter to the benefit of all mankind.\nAfghanistan is a peace-loving, non-aligned and neutral country and does not intend to pose any threat to, or commit any aggression against, any other country. We emphasize that Afghanistan is genuinely and earnestly striving for good relations with all countries. States and Governments on the basis of mutual respect and interests, and to live in peace and tranquillity with all nations of the world.\nThis is our sincere message to all Afghans and from all Afghans to the entire world. The Afghan nation has gained worthiness, respect and honour for its struggle for peace and justice. Any feelings of solidarity and sympathy towards this free-born and independent nation should be applied towards ending its agonies and not to perpetuating and heightening its miseries and pains.\nI ask the representatives of free and independent nations to extend their cooperation and earnest solidarity in assistance, and I pray God Almighty to grant happiness to the Afghans and peace and prosperity to all humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I, first of all, express my sincere congratulations to you on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly during its forty-sixth session.\nI wish to take this opportunity to welcome into our midst the representatives of the new Member States of the United Nations: those of the Baltic States, the two Koreas, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. The presence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania signals not only the growing universality of the United Nations, but also the power of people's right to self-determination, a power which is able to surmount all difficulties. The message of this power is particularly timely in today's world.\nThree and a half decades have passed since the people of a small country in Central Europe stood up under the banner of freedom, independence and democracy to oppose communist dictatorship and foreign occupation; and as a last resort in their struggle, they cried out to the United Nations for help. Given the cold war confrontation at the time, the free world and the United Nations, apart from moral and political support, were unable to give effective assistance to the Hungarian revolution and fight for national freedom.\nThirty-five years ago, Soviet tanks rolled in unhampered and triumphed over the right of the Hungarian people to self-determination.\nHere and now, I must extend my gratitude to those diplomats who, in the autumn of 1956 and for years afterwards, worked so hard to make known to the world the justness of the Hungarian revolution. Those of us who tried then to provide the world Organization with information from Hungary really know what the United Nations meant at that time: it meant the only chance for the hopeful and it was a forum and a link to the free world even for the sceptics. Those who came to our aid in those difficult times deserve our most heartfelt thanks.\nI believe I may say with no small measure of pride that the objectives of October 1956 have been fulfilled: Hungary has accomplished its change of system in accordance with the will of its people, expressed in free elections. My country has indeed become free, independent and democratic, and these profound changes are irreversible.\nIn June of this year, the last units of Soviet troops left our country. Hungary has thus regained its sovereignty, which had been practically non-existent since March 1944, and now its people can effectively exercise their right to self-determination.\nFor more than seven decades the world waited for the moment when communism would collapse. My Government took the initiative in the endeavours of the former communist countries to dismantle the Warsaw Treaty Organization, the military-political bloc that was completely alien to their people but upon whom it was forced. However, the fall of communism in Europe caught the democratic world unprepared. It was not ready to face the problems emerging in the region nor equipped to solve them.\nDramatically, in addition to communism, another totalitarian system, that of fascism and national socialism, also afflicted the generations of our century. Those generations suffered from the consequences of the incapacity for action against the 1917 Bolshevik coup, from the defeatist policy following the Hitlerite takeover and from the international arrangements that followed. They suffered because, politically, there was a lack of resolve and determination, and the world had to pay dearly for this. No realpolitik of any kind can absolve a generation from observing certain fundamental political and moral norms, because otherwise - in the absence of timely action against a totalitarian system - millions will perish. This is the lesson of the twentieth century.\nToday Hungary has a functioning parliamentary democracy based on a multi-party system, organically linked to the political structure of the democratic countries of Europe and North America. As in other States founded on the rule of law, the full exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in our country is guaranteed by laws and regulations, in accordance with international norms and standards.\nThe recent past has seen fundamental and beneficial changes in the system of international relations. The East-West division, built on ideological-mi 1itary confrontation, and the age of the cold war have come to an end. In the view of the Hungarian Government, such tried and tested European structures as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the European Community and the Council of Europe are among the major pillars of security and stability in Europe. These efficient organizations are attractive to peoples and nations because they provide them with effective guarantees for their security and economic and social development. Hungary lends full support to their role and mission. We welcome the endeavours of these organisations and deem it of fundamental importance to build substantive relations with the new democracies of the central and eastern European regions.\nThe adoption of the Charter of Paris, which was a culmination of the Helsinki process, has opened a new chapter in the life of Europe, the continent most adversely affected by the division following the Second World War, having suffered for decades from its consequences. The document, based on common Euro-Atlantic values that link the participating States, may become a genuine code of pan-European cooperation.\nThe promising process of a peaceful, prosperous, free and democratic Europe is seriously threatened by such conflict situations as that which we are witnessing, for instance, in Yugoslavia. There, the remnants of the communist-nationalist dictatorship, which have not yet been fully defeated, are facing the forces of democracy; the aspirations of intermingled nations for self determination are ever more manifest; the legitimate claims of nations and minorities for autonomy are stifled; and, on top of all this, the army has shrugged off constitutional control. Conscious of the threat to the security and stability of Europe, and feeling a special sense of responsibility for the half -million Hungarians living in Yugoslavia, Hungary is following the tragic events in that country with the deepest concern.\nThere is a mistaken belief among the world public that in Yugoslavia there is a cease-fire violated by sporadic incidents in towns with unknown names. In reality, however, there is a cruel, ongoing war there. There is massive mobilisation, and recruits are being sent to fight untrained in a conflict in which they do not wish to take part. This mobilisation was condemned by the constitutionally elected President of that country. That is why hundreds and thousands of young people of all nationalities are fleeing across the Yugoslavian borders to avoid the draft and a senseless death. The Croatian and Hungarian civilian populations are being chased from their homes. The number of refugees from Yugoslavia - beyond those who came to our country earlier from elsewhere - is already around 30,000. But only 10 per cent of that number are Hungarian nationals. Hungary ha3 had increasing difficulties in coping with the vast amount of related human and material problems.\nIt is of fundamental interest to us to see that a solution in our southern neighbour's territory be achieved by political means, democratically, and in full conformity with the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris. Like other participants in the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe (CSCE), my Government supports the mediation efforts of the European Community, including the work of the peace conference in The Hague. In this connection, I deem it necessary to underscore that, in addition to the involvement of the republics of Yugoslavia, the institutional involvement of the representatives of the Albanian, Hungarian and other ethnic communities concerned, and due consideration of their legitimate aspirations, are indispensable to the settlement of the conflict. We maintain the view that only the simultaneous implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination, universal human rights and the rights of national minorities can bring a lasting solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia.\nWe welcome United Nations Security Council resolution 713 (1991), which describes the crisis in Yugoslavia as constituting a threat to international peace and security; voices concern over the consequences of the conflict for the countries of the region, in particular in the border areas of neighbouring countries; recalls that no territorial changes within Yugoslavia brought about by violence are acceptable; and fully supports the efforts for peace of the European Community under the auspices of the CSCE.\nWe are convinced that the international community and all those who take an active part in the search for peace in Yugoslavia should draw the appropriate conclusions from the state of affairs caused by the brutal use of force, and should base their behaviour on the reality of the situation. It is of universal interest that the crises and tensions in Europe be settled as soon as possible and that a united and consolidated Europe emerge as a stabilizing force for the adjoining regions and beyond. In this process, the United Nations will also face great challenges in the coming years.\nLooking beyond Europe, we can generally observe the continuation of the positive processes and changes already under way. The bipolar world has become a multipolar one. The end of the cold war has made it possible for questions of regional conflict, which had been a field of sharp confrontation and rivalry, to become elements of cooperation between the great Powers. These developments open up more favourable prospects for political solutions to the destabilizing regional conflicts.\nParadoxically, the beginning of the new era is marked by the creation of a vast coalition of nations in connection with a war - the war in the Gulf.\nWe consider that the unprecedented concerted international action aimed at upholding international law during the Gulf crisis was the first practical, post-cold war manifestation of cooperation based on global partnership. We look upon the experience of that war as both a milestone and a precedent in respect to the conflict management possibilities and involvement of the United Nations. It was actually the first time since the establishment of the world Organisation that the observance of the principles guiding inter-State relations was enforced by all necessary means; in other words, that the hitherto nominal function of the United Nations system of collective security was put into practice.\nIn this context, we, as a member of the family of democratic nations, are proud of having made a contribution - small in scope, but in conformity with our modest possibilities - to the victory of the allied forces which liberated occupied Kuwait.\nWe are convinced that the sanctions against Iraq should be maintained so long as the Iraqi Government fails to comply fully with all its obligations under the resolutions of the Security Council.\nA specific consequence of the Gulf war is that it has created more favourable conditions for a negotiated settlement of the decades-old conflict in the Middle East. He are hopeful that on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and as a result of modifications occurring in the positions and attitudes of the parties concerned, the obstacles to the establishment of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace can be removed. For our part, we support resolutely the idea of convening a Middle East peace conference and the concurrent beginning of direct talks between the parties concerned in the conflict.\nThe principle of the self-determination of peoples cannot be applied selectively. Peace in the Middle East can be brought about, inter alia, on the basis of that principle. It is urgent, therefore, that the General Assembly revoke its resolution on Zionism adopted in 1975. Zionism is the Jewish people's philosophy of self-determination and the establishment of their own State. The resolution to which I have referred thus calls into question those fundamental rights of the Jewish people.\nWith the ideas of freedom and democracy gaining more and more ground, human rights and the rights of minorities are increasingly finding their legitimate place in relations between States at the end of the twentieth century. Accordingly, the priorities of Hungarian foreign policy include the\ninternational protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, along with the unequivocal accountability of States for their voluntarily assumed obligations, irrespective of where violations of these rights and freedoms occur. This policy is inseparably linked with efforts to promote joint international action for the effective protection of the rights of national minorities.\nAlong with other democratic States, we resolutely maintain the view that violations of human rights and minority rights cannot be considered as an exclusively internal affair of the country concerned. Most recently, the United Nations has achieved notable results in favourably influencing the attitude of Governments that have rejected the lawful call for international scrutiny. It is regrettable, however, that the principle that the United Nations proceeds legitimately in ensuring respect for human rights has not yet gained universal acceptance. In our view. Governments should see a helping hand, rather than an accusing finger, in such actions by the United Nations. In line with those same considerations, we support the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 in Berlin.\nFor seven decades now, one third of all Hungarians, several million of them - one of the largest national minorities in Europe - have been living beyond the borders of our country. In keeping with its international commitments, the Hungarian Government devotes special attention to the fate of Hungarians and all other minorities, and to their enjoyment of human and minority rights. We support and press for giving the international community a role to play in the realization of those rights. Therefore, in cases of violations of these rights, we shall not hesitate to seek assistance in international forums, in addition to our bilateral relations, to establish responsibility and redress violations of human rights.\nIn the prevailing international situation, which is transitional in many respects but is basically of a favourable character, the world Organisation is now for the first time since it was established in a position to live up in practice to the principled and purposes enshrined in its Charter. The results and successes recently achieved in the maintenance of international peace and security have earned the United Nations the growing confidence of the international community and have created a stronger demand that the world Organisation increase its involvement and activities. The outstanding role of the outgoing Secretary-General is duly recognized, and I wish to express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar the sincere and well-earned appreciation of my Government for a decade of activity.\nThe changes in international politics have created a new situation for the United Nations. The present structure of the Organization is still a reflection of the world as it developed after the Second World War. Today, it must meet new challenges and must face new tasks, which calls for a reform of the world Organization and for its adaptation to the changing circumstances. The power of the United Nations is only as great as the power Member States are willing to assign it. However, Member States, and the major Powers among them, should lend the United Nations the proper amount of power, so that the Organization can have not only rights, but also the capacity to enforce them. The world Organization has never had to bear such responsibilities and it has never had as possibilities as great as those it has now in the wake of the disintegration of the bipolar world.\nWe welcome as a new manifestation of the sense of responsibility of the major Powers the concrete and bold initiative announced the other day by President George Bush of the United States, on a significant reduction in his country's nuclear arsenal. It is also promising that a similar will has been indicated on the part of the Soviet leadership. We believe that such measures are clear signs of the advance of a new and store secure world and that the other nuclear Powers will follow suit.\nIn the decades surrounding the turn of the century, the United Nations will unquestionably have to play a greater role than ever before. It will have to face such global challenges as the conversion of military industry to meet peaceful demands, the reduction of the shocking differences in economic development, the population explosion, the degradation of the natural environment, the world-wide enforcement of human rights, and other important issues.\nThe United Nations can contribute effectively to the solution of all these global challenges only if it develops into an up to date, dynamic, flexible and potent organization. The Hungarian Government will support with all the means at its disposal this steady process of change.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to extend my sincere congratulations to Ambassador Shihabi, a good friend of mine and a prominent diplomat, on his election as President of the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nI should also like to express my highest appreciation to the secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his outstanding report, which outlines our hopes and dilemmas and charts our future courses. In the same spirit, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his exceptional and tireless endeavours over the course of the past 10 years in favour of peace and better understanding among all human beings, peoples and nations throughout the world.\nIt is also with great pleasure that I join in welcoming seven new States to the world Organisation. I congratulate the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Estonia, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands on joining the great family of the United Nations.\nThe events that have taken place in the world since the last session of the General Assembly are dramatic and imposing, indeed. Today, I have chosen to speak about today's world of great expectations and new vistas and about new challenges, risks and uncertainties; about Yugoslavia as an integral yet sombre part of European and world changes; about the new world order and global stability at the close of the twentieth century; and about the United Nations, as the key instrument of a world that is being integrated on a new basis.\nMe have entered a new era in international relations the changes on the world political scene are far-reaching and irreversible. The end of the cold war has ushered in an altogether new age of freedom and democracy. Bipolar ideological, political and military confrontations belong to the past. However, this new epoch raises new questions. It is incumbent upon us to find proper answers.\nThe dramatic days in the Soviet Union that shook the world brought about a major turnabout of this century. The fundamental transformations in that country that led to the birth of the \\\"new thinking\\\" have accelerated the pace of history, but they have also shed light on the complexity of the options for peace and progress, freedom and democracy.\nHew realities call for new answers. How do we bridge the enormous disparities in the social and economic spheres? How do we affirm the new values end remove the causes of non divisions and retrogressive trends? How do we carry out the much-needed social transformations and overcome the often concomitant extremism, nationalism and other degenerative tendencies? How do we meet the demands of a propulsive economy, human rights and social justice and avoid the undercurrents of new totalitarian systems that feed on human misery and poverty?\nThe challenges are many. They call for political, economic and intellectual efforts at all levels - national, subregional, regional, continental and global. You have all known Yugoslavia well, ever since the time when, as a member of the victorious anti-nazi coalition, it was among the first to sign the United Nations Charter, or when it was the \\\"first dissident\\\" of Europe. You knew it in the period of the cold war as a non-aligned State not part of any bloc. You also remember it from the days of the contemporary world's and Europe's major trials and challenges. You recall it as a country that has for decades been a factor of European stability.\nNow, Yugoslavia has become a matter of concern for many international forums and for its friends worldwide. As is well-known, the Yugoslav crisis was on the Security Council's agenda two days ago, and a resolution was adopted. At that meeting, I stated that today's Yugoslavia was a great threat to itself and thus, in a way, was a threat to a larger area. It could hardly be expected of a representative of a country actually to accuse himself. However, I find nothing unusual about that. This Organisation and its Security Council stand for and protect peace, freedom and prosperity for all peoples, nations and countries of the world. That is exactly why we should speak up here even about our own problems and challenges and, on this basis, seek support and help.\nI presume that the main points of the resolution on Yugoslavia are generally known: the Security Council fully supported the efforts undertaken by the European Community - under the auspices of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and consistent with its principles - to restore peace and dialogue in Yugoslavia, through the Conference on Yugoslavia and the mechanisms set forth within it; the Security Council appealed urgently to, and encouraged, all parties in Yugoslavia to settle their disputes peacefully and through negotiation within the framework of The Hague Conference; the Security Council decided that all States should immediately implement a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Yugoslavia; and called on all States to refrain from any action which might contribute to increasing tension and to impeding or delaying a peaceful and negotiated outcome to the conflict in Yugoslavia.\nAs can be seen, we both initiated and welcomed the peace action of the European Community, the CSCE and the United Nations. It certainly did not imply that we harboured hopes that someone else would take over our responsibilities. On the contrary, for us, it merely implied an additional commitment to do only what we should, and must do for ourselves. \nWe do not wish to justify, nor could we justify and explain the current Yugoslav drama even with soma undeniable facts first, that it is an integral part of the turmoil that has beset Central and Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and other parts of the world in recent years, and that, due to the historical, political and ethnic differences involved, the Yugoslav crisis has an additional and most tragic component) and, second that the tragedy of my country is the sum and substance of the problems that plague Europe and the world of the post-cold-war era.\nAfter all that has happened it is obvious that Yugoslavia should be redefined. He have to find a formula that would both recognise legitimate national aspirations and contemporary needs for integration on a new basis. I believe that there is hope for such an outcome. Though still fragile, the breakthrough made two days ago, through the agreement on the implementation of a cease-fire, is an encouraging step forward.\nAs I said the day before yesterday, we fully recognise that our crisis should in no way endanger anyone, particularly not those closest to us, our neighbours. But it implies that it is our neighbours who should, for their part, be understanding and patient where our problems are concerned. Only the day before yesterday, a colleague of mine, the Foreign Minister of Albania, Mr. Kapllani, did just the opposite. He poured oil on the flames. Although Mr. Kapllani devoted three full pages of his statement to my country, I myself will make no further comment.\nAt the end of this part of my speech, I am genuinely prompted to thank, once again, all those who showed friendly concern and feelings for the Yugoslav peoples at the hard times they are going through. Perhaps the Yugoslav crisis, a test for the new European and world architecture, could best mirror the interdependence of national, regional, continental and global stability. The Europe of the Paris Charter, concerned so much with the individual and his rights, is stable only in interaction with the entire world. That is Europe's authentic contribution to the emergence of the new civilisation of peace. The process of global restructuring is under way. It requires utmost sensitivity not only in the spheres of political transformation, but also in the economic and social ones. Otherwise, the existing disparities might be further deepened. Therefore, even after the bipolar world has ceased to exist, the goals and potentials of the policy of non-alignment are not exhausted. Quite the opposite, the non-aligned policy now has new motivation.\nIt is logical that the old system should be dismantled, first and foremost, by those who built it on the postulates of ideological influence and military might. However, the emerging system of international relations should not be overshadowed by new supremacies. World forces and influences are neither expected to be, now could they be symmetric. But globally the new world architecture will not be sustainable without due inputs and influences of all factors. \nA new world order based on peace and democracy, freedom and equality, stability and development should apply to all. Only universality can ensure its lasting nature; and only participation of all, its viability. The order that guarantees peace and security to the entire international community requires both participation and responsibility of the world's majority embodied in the non-aligned countries. My colleague the Foreign Minister of Ghana, Mr. Asamoah, spoke about this with competence only yesterday.\nThe world of economic development and prosperity is incompatible with the poverty and stagnation of the developing world, to which most of the non-aligned countries belong. It is illusory to expect an even and perfectly balanced global development, but equally unrealistic to project a world development if some lack opportunities for expansion.\nA civilisation having the individual and his human and civil rights as its supreme values needs free and stable societies - democracy, but also sound economic and social prospects. And last but not least, the environment, which has been taken for granted for so long, now, in the new world order, requires true global concern and common protection.\nFor all these reasons, I have recalled the purpose and the potential of the policy of non-alignment. The name given to that policy and to the movement behind it might be outdated, but the principles and goals it stands for certainly are not. They are compatible with all ongoing positive processes in today's world - with the progress in the field of disarmament and the signature of the START Treaty; with the progress of negotiations on chemical weapons; with the general approach in favour of enhanced controls of conventional arms transfers; with the ongoing processes of defusing the regional crises and with the constructive dialogues underway; with the effective role played by the United Nations, under the Charter, in cases of threats to peace, breaches of peace or acts of aggression, as in the case of the recent Gulf crisis; and with the painstaking efforts invested in the longest lasting world crisis - the Middle East crisis and the Palestinian question - so that we may now already speak in terms of a peace conference, a meeting of all the factors involved, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nToday we speak of the rebirth of the United Nations and its return to the blueprints of 1945. By putting an end to bloc confrontation and embarking upon the process of negotiation, the major world Powers have made an enormous contribution to the revitalization of the world Organization and its Charter. Now the United Nations has a unique opportunity to become an even more important forum absorbing momentous world changes and channelling the positive tendencies, a forum dealing with all fundamental and crucial issues affecting the interests of the entire international community - in short, to become the linchpin of the new world order.\nThe United Nations can truly be a place for accommodating interests in establishing and expanding regional organizations and mechanisms in the field of security and cooperation, as well as in the political, economic, environmental and cultural spheres. Today security is integral not only in its global and regional, political and military character, but also in its economic and social character, including human rights in particular.\nThrough the world Organization, the great Powers and the developed countries can effectively coordinate mutual efforts to eliminate the vestiges of the cold war, in particular in the field of nuclear and any other disarmament. Through the world Organization we can all influence affectively the resolution of regional crises, the creation of integrative structures and mechanisms, and comprehensive economic and technological development.\nIn brief, through the United Nations, and more specifically through the cooperation of the General Assembly and the Security Council, we can all join in establishing the new world order, and thus in translating the common option for peace, security, stability, democracy and development into reality - not a reality for some, excluding the others, but a reality for all. We have the rich experience of the past 46 years to draw upon. We believe that the world can and must change for the better. This is why we are here today.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, let me begin by expressing my congratulations on your election to our highest office. I wish you every success and pledge the sincere support of my delegation.\nI am pleased to take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands as new Members of the United Nations.\nI am also delighted to be able to welcome the three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as new Members of our world Organisation. After having suffered half a century of military occupation and enforced annexation, the present status of the Baltic States as fully recognized members of the world community is more than timely. Relations between Iceland and these European neighbours have intensified over the past few years and we look forward to increased cooperation with their Governments in this and other multilateral forums.\nIt is only a natural reflection of the current times that our attention and thoughts dwell upon the process of change in our immediate political environment and upon the challenges ahead. Seldom if ever has history recorded such a radical and rapid transformation of International politics and inter-State relations as we have recently witnessed in Europe. Rarely have global tasks and the need for collective effort been so formidable.\nGreat change entails both opportunities and risks. The opportunities inherent in the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe have, in fact, ended the cold war.\nEvents in Europe have progressed to such an extent that we have reason to believe that the advance of democracy will not be reversed. The failed coup in the Soviet Union last month demonstrated the tenacity of democratic aspirations. Political and military intimidation was successfully resisted by the people of Russia and their democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin a courageous leader who rose to the occasion. Our hopes were reinforced that tanks and concrete walls would no longer be a determining factor in European politics. Instead, the principles of democracy, self- determination and the rule of law would prevail.\nYet, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the process of democratisation and economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe is still fraught with danger arising from a number of factors; particularly the paralysing economic problems and ethnic conflicts. The extreme vulnerability of the new democracies is evident to all. They have to contend with political and social unrest stemming from economic difficulties, ethnic conflict and, in some cases, extreme nationalism.\nPresident Vaclav Havel of the Czech and Slovak Republic has pointed out that the democratisation of Central and Eastern Europe and their transition to market economies are \\\"affected by more Impediments than was originally expected and that the unholy legacy these countries have to deal with goes deeper and has wider ramifications than anyone could imagine\\\".\nHistory records numerable instances of the interconnection between war and major change. The decline and fall of empires have frequently resulted in bloodshed. We need to be mindful of the risks posed by change.\nThe situation in Yugoslavia is indicative of these risks. It also serves as a reminder that ethnic conflicts can no longer be regarded as the sole responsibility of individual States. Such conflicts can have wider implications and could constitute a threat to international peace and security. In Yugoslavia the fundamental lesson of the transformation in Europe has obviously not been understood. A political order based on coercion and oppression cannot be upheld contrary to the will of the people. The simple fact is that if the peoples of Yugoslavia are not willing to hold the country together, it will not stay together. The international community may have to accept this fact and heed the call for recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. \nFuture stability and security on the European continent depend on the continued success of the democratic process, as well as on the alleviation of economic and ethnic problems. The task is complex and its order of magnitude is profound. It will require great efforts by the peoples of central and Eastern Europe. However, external political, economic and technological assistance will also be essential, We will no longer protect our own interests through passivity or inaction: to hesitate at this juncture would be self-defeating. Communism in central and Eastern Europe belongs to the past. Whatever remains of this ideology will wither away sooner rather than later.\nThe present situation is reminiscent of the years after the Second World War. The discouraging task of building from the ruins of war had a certain similarity to the need for reconstruction in central and Eastern Europe following years of oppression and economic centralisation: there was the same mood of despondency and frustration. Post-war reconstruction was successful because of that unique endeavour in the history of international relations, the Marshall Plan - a rare act of statesmanship. This magnanimous deed provided exhausted European economies with the resources needed for self-reliance. The psychological support provided to the peoples of Europe was equally valuable. The countries of central and eastern Europe are in need of both now: a new Marshall Plan is called for.\nI do not mean to imply that recent developments in Europe should be predominant in our deliberations to the exclusion of all other concerns. Never the less, we cannot ignore the positive global implications of a reduced danger of catastrophic war. Only if Europe remains stable and peaceful can the resources absorbed by the cold war be recouped. This will be the principal prerequisite for more concerted action in international affairs. The satisfactory conclusion of the cold war enabled the United Nations to react swiftly and decisively to the brutal Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\nThe imperative need for an effective global and collective security system became painfully apparent during the Second World War. Subsequently, our world Organisation was established. During the intervening five decades, our perception of security has widened and our awareness of the various interdependencies has deepened. As important as the defence dimension of security may be, there are also political, economic, social and, increasingly, ecological aspects of the concept. Security and peace cannot be achieved, or sustained in the long term, without human rights, economic development and environmental stability.\nA global and collective security system, if it is to be applied efficiently to dealing with serious threats to our common environment, will succeed only through increased international cooperation. We must seize the opportunity presented by the prevailing international political climate and focus our attention and energy on constructing a global and collective security system. In doing so, we can finally realize the world order of international law and cooperation envisaged by the authors of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe Nordic countries have already initiated the formulation of their common approach to this opportunity. Eventually, all the Members of this Organization will have to agree on an appropriate channel for our deliberations and decisions. A group led by the former Chancellor of Germany, Willy Brandt, has laid significant groundwork by forwarding suggestions and proposals on organizational reforms in the United Nations. The Government of Iceland supports the group's proposal for the establishment of an independent international commission on global governance to prepare for a world summit to respond to this challenge.\nThe present opportunity to revitalise the United Nations is a true peace dividend. One way to seize this opportunity would be to act quickly to solidify measures taken under the auspices of this Organisation to establish a stable world order of the oceans. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was signed in Jamaica nine years ago. One hundred and fifty-nine States signed the Convention and thereby expressed their agreement with its objectives and purposes. Forty-nine States have ratified or acceded to the Convention; it can now be foreseen that the Convention may enter into force within the next two years.\nIceland has ratified the Convention; we believe that its provisions constitute a broadly acceptable regime for the rational exploitation of the world's marine resources. It has established rules for a wide range of uses for the seas, thereby reducing the potential for conflict between interested States. I might add that, in the field of environmental protection, the Brundtland Commission concluded that the most significant initial action that States could take in the interests of the oceans' threatened life-support system was to ratify the Convention.\nWe are of course aware that a number of industrialized countries remain concerned about the rules in the Convention on the exploitation of the deep seabed. We must here act quickly to preserve the bonds that were forged between developing nations and the industrialized world at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is our submission that some of the difficulties may have related to differences in ideology in the past, but these differences art fait disappearing from the international scene.\nThe Government of Iceland is encouraged by efforts under way to ensure that the Convention will be implemented in a viable manner. We applaud the initiative of the Secretary-General, and call on all States to support these efforts, which would be to the benefit of the entire international community.\nNext year, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will convene in Rio de Janeiro. The Government of Iceland has high expectations for the outcome of the Conference, which is dedicated to our common future.\nInternational cooperation in environmental matters must be based on the right of all human beings to a safe environment. We must all of us accept the obligation to conserve natural resources and maintain biological diversity, and the affluent amongst us should not turn a blind eye to the justified need of humankind for natural resources to be utilised on the basis of the principle of optimum sustainable yield. These principles should be incorporated into a concise legal instrument, drawing from the experience of formulating the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nThe Government of Iceland is distressed to note that attempts have been made to introduce into the Rio process proposals on the management of whales. These proposals place the emphasis on ambiguous ethical considerations, and thus raise a false environmental issue and run counter to the principle of sustainable development. This problem is compounded when States consider introducing trade restrictions in response to differences in environmental policies.\nThe Government of Iceland feels that the Rio Conference should lay down a substantive action plan addressing all major areas affecting the relationship between the environment and the economy. In particular, there must be immediate action to restrict and monitor all dumping and discharges of radioactive materials, heavy metals and persistent organic substances in the oceans or in sub-seabed repositories. We are particularly concerned about the persistent danger of radioactive contamination of the oceans: the threat emanates from various sources, not least from nuclear installations bordering on ocean areas. It is simply not acceptable that States should plan hazardous facilities in circumstances where the slightest accident could have calamitous effects on neighbouring States.\nThe risk also emanates from nuclear reactors at sea. The Government of Iceland will continue to work for international recognition of the potential dangers posed by accidents involving sea-borne nuclear reactors. Inevitably, environmental factors play a major role in Iceland's policy on naval arms control and confidence-building. Furthermore, the Government of Iceland believes that the international management and conservation of the living resources of the high seas deserve greater attention from the world community. In the words of the Declaration for a New Global Agenda:\n\\\"The goal of the cold war was to get others to change their values and behaviour, but winning the battle to save the planet depends on changing our own values and behaviour.\\\"\nThat is the message of \\\"Vinland Revisited\\\", a joint Norwegian-Icelandic venture, meant not only to commemorate the bringing together of Europe and America a thousand years ago, but, more important, to look ahead and ask ourselves how the spirit of discovery in modern times could be aimed at shaping mankind's common future on our planet. Let us remember that we have no more new continents to exploit or expand to. We have no choice but to accept our common obligation to preserve our natural habitat, the only planet that we have.\nThe interaction between the state of the environment and the progress of development is increasingly clear. We can considerably boost support for development, while contributing to global environmental protection, through increased international economic cooperation.\nDuring the past decade the economic situation in the majority of developing countries has deteriorated. The protectionism of some of the industrialised countries is undeniably one of the primary reasons for this trend. In fact, developing countries suffer more through protectionism than they gain through development assistance. Consequently, the industrialised countries could make a major contribution to development by liberalising trade and opening up their markets to the products of the developing countries.\nAs a country overwhelmingly dependant on one natural resource and export commodity, Iceland well understands the situation faced by many developing countries. Indeed, very few countries are as dependent on foreign trade as my country. The problems caused by protectionism are in fact not confined to relations between industrialised countries and developing countries they also emerge in relations between the industrialised countries themselves. As a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Iceland has been actively involved in negotiations with its European neighbours and has often come up against the same type of short-sighted policies as have prevented access by developing countries to the markets of Europe. The policy of the European Communities of linking trade and access to resources is totally inappropriate and unacceptable. It is a stumbling block in the path of further European integration.\nEfforts to invigorate the economies of the countries of central and eastern Europe are an additional incentive for liberalised trade, as they may absorb resources otherwise available to programmes for the assistance of developing countries. We are unlikely to find better means to rectify this situation than by liberalising trade policies. This need not be a prolonged process. We have already reached the final stages of the Uruguay Round of negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These negotiations are of paramount importance for the future stability of the international community. He must now exercise the political will to lead them to a successful conclusion.\nIn my opening remarks I referred to the historic transformation of central and Eastern Europe. I believe it is not over-Eurocentric to state that recent events in Europe have been of global political and economic importance. But, more than this, they demonstrate to the whole world that the human spirit is indomitable. The triumph of democracy, which in itself entails respect for human rights, constitutes a clear message to the oppressed everywhere: that theirs is not a hopeless cause, since even the mightiest totalitarian means of oppression did not suffice in the end to quell, subdue or restrain dissent or opposition. Or, in the words of that great, stubborn humanist, President Landsbergis of Lithuania, \\\"The independence and inherent dignity of the human spirit shall prevail\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I offer my warmest congratulations to Ambassador Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. His great skills guarantee the positive results expected of this session. In addition, we are especially pleased to see the representative of a country with which Greece maintains traditional bonds of friendship presiding over the General Assembly.\nMay I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, for the effective manner in which he discharged his functions as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session.\nI should also like to join previous speakers in praising the Secretary-General for the tireless efforts he has made in the 10 years he has devoted to the service of our Organization. For a decade, during which the world not only faced great challenges but also underwent historic changes, he has so ably guided the United Nations that today it can perform its duties more effectively.\nI should also like to welcome the seven new Members - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - which have joined this world Organisation, bringing it closer to full universality.\nMoreover, I take this opportunity to welcome the restoration to the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their rightful independence and sovereignty. I wish them success in overcoming the difficulties they are facing today, as they struggle to reorganize their political and economic structures to benefit their people.\nEarlier this week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Communities, delivered a statement on behalf of its member States. My Government fully subscribes to the contents of that statement.\nGreece is firmly committed to and fully supports the endeavours towards European integration. We believe that the economic and political union that we are currently negotiating in Europe will enhance progress and prosperity not only on the European continent but also in all countries with which the Community engages in trade. The Europe we are envisaging will not only constitute the cornerstone of democracy, stability and peace; it will also be in the forefront in the fight against terrorism and drugs, an area to which my country has been attaching utmost importance.\nSince I spoke from this rostrum one year ago, dramatic events have taken place and historic changes have occurred in many parts of the world. The questions that are foremost in my mind are the following: Is the world today a better place than it was one year ago? Have we worked collectively as United Nations to make the world a better place than it was when we last met in the General Assembly? And what are the results of the actions we have undertaken to that end?\nThe answers are complex. Developments in the last 12 months have not been uniform. Nevertheless, I believe it is safe to say that more people today are in a position to take charge of their respective countries and to improve their lives than was the case one year ago.\nThe main success of the last year has been the consolidation of the twin principles of democracy and freedom in placed where they had already triumphed the previous year, and their irresistible expansion where tyranny held sway only a few months ago. More men and women have joined the community of free peoples. We welcome them, we pay tribute to their struggle and we honour those who had to sacrifice their lives in the battle for freedom, democracy and human rights.\nHe Greeks take special pride in witnessing the flowering of democracy throughout the world, for this autumn we begin to celebrate the birth of democracy 2,500 years ago in Greece. Long before that, mankind had indeed learned that society could not function without order. But it was also believed that order could not be maintained without despotism. It was the Greeks who discovered that you could have a symbiosis of order and freedom by giving a share of political power to every citizen and making everyone equal before the law. Allow me, therefore, to claim that no one is more pleased than the Greek people that democracy is flourishing now as it never has before.\nIn fact, the wave of democratisation created by reform and free elections in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe gives us hope that a current of reform will spread across the world, and that it will do so in a peaceful way. In this regard, we welcome the restoration of constitutional order in the Soviet Union, and we hope that the process towards democracy and a market economy initiated by President Gorbachev and enhanced by the action of the democratic forces in the Soviet Union will gather new momentum.\nThe important efforts undertaken by the Soviet leadership to transform Soviet society must be supported, especially by the most developed nations. This assistance will help the Soviet Union to overcome the serious economic difficulties it la facing today, and will lessen social tensions related to its transition to a free market economy.\nWe note with concern that the internal situation in the Soviet Union has not yet stabilised enough to allow institutions to function effectively. Ha hope that the Republics will succeed in formulating a new legal framework, on a voluntary basis, to aid the progress of political and economic reform.\nWe have started building the post-cold-war order. Its architecture is still being created. But its foundation and its main pillars are already clear: they can be none other than the principles of democracy, freedom, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.\nSocial change through peaceful means is a development associated with the end of the cold war and the resulting relaxation of tensions in the international arena. In an interdependent world, the distinctions between the purely internal affairs of a nation and such international concerns as peace and security is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Safeguarding human rights has become an essential part of international relations. The expression of concern about human rights violations can no longer be considered interference in the internal affairs of States. This was recently reaffirmed in the Declaration on Human Sights adopted by the Council of Europe last June in Luxembourg. The transition to democratic forms of government is also becoming a concern that is not confined to individual nations or States.\nI wish to pledge the support of the Greek Government to every effort the United Nations will be called upon to make for the promotion of democracy and human rights throughout the world. All peoples setting out on the path to democracy through peaceful means can count on the support of the Greek people who have given the world the concept and the very word \\\"democracy\\\".\nTo support the ideals of democracy, the Western world must also systematically promote and encourage economic development. Many speakers have already indicated optimum ways in which economic aid and technological assistance can be provided by the richer to the poorer countries of the world. Let me only stress that goodwill and sympathy are not enough. We must, at all costs, never allow the old ideological division of East and West to be substituted by a new division of poverty between North and South.\nIndeed, in only nine years, 6 billion people will share the Earth with a continuing high rate of population growth, increasing environmental hazards and widespread poverty. The severe economic shocks produced by political developments of the last two and a half years have seriously affected global growth. The Gulf crisis has taken a heavy economic, social and environmental toll on the region. The migrant workers and civilian populations were particularly affected. The interplay between politics, poverty, armed conflict and ineffective policies has intensified, posing new challenges to humanitarian institutions and to world leaders. A global approach is needed to economic, social and environmental problems.\nThe greatest challenge of the next decade will thus be to strengthen the United Nations system so that it can play a much greater role in providing increased economic opportunities for the developing countries, in improving the global environment and human development, and in addressing emergency situations such as international migration, drugs and AIDS.\nFinally, the immediate objective should be to restore growth which would not irreparably destroy the air, the rivers, the forests, the oceans or any other part of nature. The World Conference on Environment and Development, to be held next year in Rio, has raised high hopes in all countries that a consensus will emerge which will strike a balance between environment and development.\nIn building the future, we must also pursue disarmament, an area in which Europe has provided the first actual proving-ground. We have supported every effort to achieve a reduction of conventional armed forces in Europe and we hope that these measures will constitute an enlightening example to other continents. My country has applauded with the rest of the world, the signing, three months ago, of the strategic arms reduction Treaty (START) which will reduce Soviet and American strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 per cent. Finally, Greece is ready to support any measure and effort aimed at strengthening the control, reduction and elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nSeveral times in the past, the Balkans have been torn apart by divisions and differences, creating the term \\\"Balkanization\\\". Yet, those convulsions have had much wider repercussions beyond the geographical boundaries of the Balkans. In the course of the last few months, a new, potentially dangerous confrontation threatens to reinstate the turbulent history of the Balkans. The crisis in Yugoslavia, partly due to the country's multi-ethnic composition, is threatening peace and stability in the region and beyond.\nFrom the very beginning of the crisis, Greece tried - both through the European Community and other venues - to ensure a peaceful outcome of the crisis. We hope that the peace conference, convened under the European Community's initiative in The Hague, and Lord Carrington's wise guidance, will soon result in a permanent solution. Otherwise, the dangers of a spill over effect of violence will increase dramatically.\nGreece is obviously ready to accept any solution which the Yugoslav parties agree to by peaceful means and through dialogue. In this regard we hope that Security Council resolution 713 (1991) will further enhance the efforts undertaken by the European Community to put an end to the bloodshed and bring about a solution to the Yugoslav crisis by agreed procedures.\nGreece is especially pleased that a close neighbour, Albania, is among the countries whose peoples have managed, in the year since the last General Assembly, to break the shackles of totalitarianism and set their country on the road to democracy and freedom.\nThe dire economic conditions in Albania have sent tens of thousands of refugees to Greece, Italy and other countries. We urge the developed nations of the world to coma to the aid of the Albanian people, and we urge the Albanian Government to move quickly with determination, in order to promote economic reforms especially full property rights - so that its people will be able to support themselves in their own country in the near future. We naturally feel a special concern for the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Greeks in the country and want to see them recover their full political, economic and cultural rights. We seek for them the same rights and privileges that the Albanian Government is asking for ethnic Albanians living outside its borders - no more, no less.\nA few months ago, when faced in the Gulf with the most acute crisis of the post-cold-war era, the Governments of the world decided to react through the United Nations to the aggression against Kuwait. Articles of the United Nations Charter, which had been dormant since their inception during the cold-war years, started to come to life as the nations of the world, united in their determination to act collectively and resolutely against aggression, began to use these Articles for the collective restoration of international peace and security. In an unprecedented unity of purpose, the coalition of the international community against the aggressor succeeded in reversing the occupation of Kuwait. The determination and joint action of the Members of the United Nations have thus marked the beginning of a new peace-keeping role for this Organisation.\nCloser to our country, the Middle East continues to be the most explosive region in the world. How unfortunate that the area that has nourished some of the most important civilisations in history and is the birthplace of three major religions, should now sound in the minds of many as a synonym for violence. The most important element of the Middle East problem is indeed the Arab-Israeli conflict. Two of the most ancient peoples in the world, with outstanding contributions to the common heritage of mankind, are pitted against each other. My Government, whose position on the issue is well known and need not be repeated, earnestly hopes that the day will soon come when the prophecy is fulfilled \\\"they shall beat their swords into ploughshares\\\"  Greece remains committed to a serious and fruitful dialogue with Turkey with a view to overcoming the causes of friction which have created dangerous tensions in the past. This commitment was reiterated \u00abt the recent meeting in Paris between Prime Minister Mitsotakis and his Turkish counterpart, Mr. Yilmax. They agreed to set up working groups to draft an agreement on friendship, cooperation and good-neighbourliness to be signed in Ankara on the occasion of a future visit by the Greek Prime Minister to the Turkish capital. This agreement is designed to create a new climate of confidence between the two nations. In this respect Greece wishes to reiterate its own commitment to the principles of international law and to the peaceful way of settling differences, including recourse to the International Court of Justice.\nHowever, I should add that attempts to improve relations between Greece and Turkey will be adversely affected by the problem of Cyprus if this problem remains unsolved despite the efforts of the Secretary-General to help bring about a just and viable solution in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the high-level agreements of 1977 and 1979.\nCyprus is the only long-standing problem in Europe to remain unresolved. All over Europe dividing lines and walls have been swept aside and foreign troops withdrawn. But in Cyprus the division of the island imposed by force of arms 17 years ago continues. Turkish troops still occupy more than a third of that unfortunate country despite the repeated resolutions of this Assembly as well as those of the Security Council.\nAs a result nearly 200,000 Greek Cypriots are still refugees in their own country; looting and destruction of the island's cultural heritage is still going on; the influx of settlers from Turkey continues unabated, if not encouraged, by the recent abolition of passports for travel between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot pseudo-State of northern Cyprus. Some 1,600 missing people still remain unaccounted for. This is a completely unacceptable situation that must not be allowed to continue.\nA very encouraging development has been the involvement of parties trying to support the Secretary-General's efforts. Last February the President of the European Community launched an initiative to promote a solution of the Cyprus problem in conformity with United Nations resolutions. That initiative was welcomed by Greece and Cyprus, but Immediately rejected by Turkey.\nEqually heartening is the United States more active involvement in the Cyprus issue which began with President Bush's visits to Greece and Turkey last July. His determination on 2 August asking for a United Nations sponsored meeting in September if adequate progress was made in the meantime nurtured new hopes that the stalemate could be broken.\nAll hopes were unfortunately deflated at the recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey in Paris when all previous positive developments were put on hold. Mr. Yilmaz, retracting the Turkish oral commitments previously made to United Nations and United States officials, denied having granted any concessions or. the Cyprus issue and attributed the responsibility for any \\\"misunderstanding\\\" to inaccurate information provided by the representatives of the Secretary-General.\nI must reiterate that the key to any solution of the Cyprus issue lies with Ankara. It is imperative that this long-standing problem should at last find its proper and just solution. It must include the strict application of international law, the protection of human rights and the scrupulous implementation of all United Nations resolutions on Cyprus.\nIn concluding, I would like to reaffirm my country's commitment to the United Nations and to the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity it embodies. In the past two years we Greeks have upgraded our participation in the work of the Organisation by becoming troop contributors to the new peace-keeping operations launched by the United Nations. We join forces with other nations of the world and pledge to spare no effort in the quest for world peace and stability.\nIt is the earnest hope of all the Greek people that, when we address this Assembly next year, at the climax of our year-long celebration of the birth of democracy, there will be unity and communal understanding in Cyprus, peace in the Balkans and the Middle East, and freedom in those corners of the world that remain darkened by despotism. Democracy has taken 25 centuries to spread to all corners of the world, but its total triumph is certain, as it is the past political system ever devised by the mind of man, a gift for all seasons and all nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I have come before the representatives of the community of nations in order to express my country's views on the great issues of our times and to reaffirm our commitment to understanding and solidarity.\nBut before beginning my statement I would like to extend my most sincere congratulations to Mr. Samir Shihabi on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at the forty-sixth session and, on behalf of Venezuela, I would like express our enthusiastic welcome to the nations that are joining our Organisation - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of Korea, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.\nThese deliberations are taking place at a time when a new international order is being defined and when the developing countries cannot be absent.\nWe, the countries represented here, must ensure that the momentous significance of this exceptional time is not weakened or tarnished and that the promising momentum unleashed by these breathtaking changes remains unabated.\nBehind us lie chapters of confrontation, intransigence and inflexibility and times of sterile, senseless controversies, dominated by the terrifying euphemism of nuclear deterrence.\nThe prospects of a less conflictive world should not make us postpone action on, or sidestep the challenges and dilemmas facing us. Some of them are old; others are new, left over from a bipolar world that still moulds historical events in terms of inequality and injustice. The building of peace requires an innovative look, not only at the conflicts still persisting, but also at the pressing economic and social problems experienced by the vast majority of mankind and the growing gap between poverty and prosperity. Let us move now from East-West confrontation to a North-South co-operation that will lead to a single united world. It is time to ask both the United States and Cuba to cease the confrontation which began in the context of the cold war. Let us have confidence that Cuba will open itself to the universal concept of democracy as we would all wish and that the United States will be open to a dialogue that puts an end to sanctions that have lost all justification and validity.\nThe evolution of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, the latter immersed in a process of vital political and economic choice, dominates the world scene, which is fraught with expectation and uncertainty.\nThe after-effects of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, compounded by the interminable crisis in the Middle East, have reawakened and brought to the forefront the need to devise a new world order that will put an end to such situations.\nMay I take this opportunity to express our firmest support for the efforts made by United States Secretary of State, Mr. Baker, to promote a conference of countries involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict that threatens to jeopardise the dramatic process ending the occupation of Kuwait. Events in the Middle East, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa reveal serious obstacles to the achievement of a new world order, making it necessary to redefine international security and devise more efficient mechanisms. Tensions of a territorial, ethnic or religious nature and an upsurge of nationalism have given rise to serious problems of inexplicable virulence.\nThe threat of disintegration of the State of Yugoslavia cannot be viewed by the United Nations as an internal problem. Venezuela associates itself with those who have called for the restoration of peace in Yugoslavia and we support the position of those Members of the Organization who are encouraging discussion in the Security Council.\nInterdependence is a phenomenon brought about by the complex realities of the contemporary world, but it must cease to be a new form of dependence which hinders efforts made to incorporate the countries of the South into the international economy, as has been stated in the report of the South Commission of which I was a member. In this context, the Non-Aligned Movement is acquiring a unique importance with the disappearance of the ideological rhetoric of the past. Its task will now be to participate actively in encouraging South-South cooperation and in promoting dialogue with the North.\nI venture to say with optimism that the new historic age that is beginning will lead to the inclusion on the international agenda of a comprehensive approach to North-South relations so that interdependence will be understood as an interweaving of problems and solutions. There are many useful areas and actions that could lead to the use of a new methodology in North-South relations. Environmental conservation and the struggle against drug trafficking are of universal priority.\nSuch questions lie in the future of continental and Caribbean Latin America. Last year in this forum, we spoke of the progress democracy had made in our countries, and said that, for this process to be irreversible, a solution had to be found to the problems of critical and extreme poverty. The inevitable macroeconomic adjustment programmes, necessary for the modernization of our societies, cannot proceed without a concurrent war against hunger, unemployment and lack of opportunity.\nThe democracies that have become stabilized in Latin America will not be secure if the governments of the area cannot significantly improve the quality of life of their people. Our democracies will not be able to survive if there is a massive increase in critical poverty and if social tensions are aggravated. We do not want aid. What we want is trade on reciprocal and balanced terms. We want a satisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round, which has been held up by trade confrontations between the United States and Europe, while our own trade is subject to a wide range of protectionist measures by the industrialised countries.\nHe must acknowledge - and we Latin Americans have not done so in the past - that our relations with the United States are changing for the better. It somehow seems, however, that Europe has not yet been able to grasp the importance of our region, although we have advised the Community's senior officials of this fact.\nFor this reason, we support the spirit of President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative, which poses the long-term challenge of a hemispheric market and at the same time includes the essential factors of debt, trade, investment and development. However, we still see, both in North America and in Europe, restrictive practices, whereby we are required to develop open economies. Yet, our natural advantages are deemed to be unfair or are referred to as dumping practices, and our exports are denied access to other markets. We welcome the growing interest Japan and other Asian nations have shown in our region.\nWe are making efforts to seek a solution to traditional territorial conflicts. We are working steadfastly to make the Latin American Economic System (SELA) a body of regional coordination and integration, and the Organization of American States (OAS) an effective instrument, attuned to the new urgent needs of the international context, an organization able to bring coherence to a hemispheric pact between the two large regions of the continent, north and south of the Rio Grande.\nWe are confident that this year we will share the satisfaction of seeing a definitive end to the bloody conflict in Central America, with peace achieved in El Salvador, through the mediation of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, to whom I should like to pay a tribute for his intelligent guidance of the United Nations during this last very complex decade.\nIn order to complete this brief account of our Latin American vision of expectations and problems, may I say that we view with deep satisfaction the spectacular advances in our regional integration processes. The Andean Pact, the Common Market of the South, the Caribbean Community and the Group of Three have, among others, marked the new economic and integrationist history of Latin America; the Rio Group has become the political interlocutor for the coordination of regional action and its coherent international impact. In addition, we strongly support the beginning of the future hemispheric market through a process of trade integration, which is being conducted among the United States of America, Canada and Mexico.\nIt has become a commonplace to say that the world is on the threshold of a new era, a new time, a new age. No subject could be more appealing this fall of 1991 in this great global forum, the United Nations. Yet, this is not the first time that we speak about a new order. In the past we have advocated a new world economic order, and here in the United Nations, for an entire decade, resounding voices from all parts of the world have been heard, warning of the pressing need to change the perception and management of world affairs, both economic and political. We do not believe that these voices have gone unheeded. On the contrary, our persistent discourse has yielded some fruit. First of all, one of its main arguments has been well corroborated. We warned that the arms race would lead the world into an unprecedented critical situation, and that growing military expenditure would create conflicts for the big Powers themselves.\nIt was impossible to understand the obstinacy of the big Powers in recognising or heeding these warnings. Today, one of the great empires, that of the cold war, no longer exists. Military expenditure and the miniaturisation of our societies have yielded the anticipated results. It was naive to believe that what might be devastating for some could be beneficial for others. The military expenditure of the West is a mirror image of that in the former Soviet Union. The policies of systematic confrontation were abetted by the military-industrial complexes of the great Powers. The manipulation of fear and the manipulation of information about arsenals were well-known tactics.\nThe twentieth century leaves a balance sheet worthy of deep reflection. Two devastating wars in the first half of the century, and in the second half a long cold war that spurred a broad range of challenges and confrontations, that fed the most unusual regional conflicts and that counted among their victims the developing countries that became the theatre and not just the audience of this struggle and in so doing became participants in its madness.\nThe possibility of building a new world order is really just beginning. But for that order to come about and to be stable there must be prior acknowledgement of the fact that no one, no country, large or small, strong or weak, can remain on the sidelines or be dominant. The idea of democracy is prevailing the world over. It is becoming widespread and the right of peoples is being recognized.\nBut we must understand that people consider democracy to mean well-being, progress in freedom, equitable economic and trade relations, an opening of markets, free communication among peoples, international cooperation, an end to domination and a balance between security and social expenditures.\nIt is not enough, in gratifying our optimism, simply to proclaim that a new order is being born, A new order is not born just because the world balance of power has collapsed. Existing challenges are tenacious. Renascent nationalisms, ethnic and religious conflicts, regional disagreements, forces that arise with anarchical impetus as a dramatic response to many decades of repression will not be easily handled or overcome.\nThe identity of all peoples, respect for them and protection of their values must be key factors in a new order so that political and religious dogmatisms abandon their resentments and do not become elements of de-stabilization. In this context we wish to mention the conflict beleaguering the people of the Sahara which must be solved with unconditional guarantees for the right to self-determination. We impatiently await the referendum that will enable the Sahraoui to join the democratic community of nations.\nWe are living in a revolutionary era of communications, of technology and science, but our time has not brought about a revolution in education or in culture. This is the great paradox, a paradox illustrative of the deep crisis confronting us. The message conveyed to the peoples of the world is not a positive one. It is not directed at preserving our fundamental values or at teaching peoples how to live together. The revolution in communications places us in simultaneous contact with all existing conflicts; its impact naturally contributes towards exalting one's one conflicts over those more remote.\nTo place such extraordinary technological resources at the service of culture, science, international cooperation and education, together with the need to protect children, is one of the challenges of the new world order that will bring back security and democracy to the world.\nLast year was the year of the summit on children, convened by the political will of Heads of State the world over. Today we are happy to see that 30 Members of the United Nations have held national conferences to devise programmes of action aimed at rescuing our children from the aggression of poverty and malnutrition.\nHere we to think that a new world order could be defined as a simple balance of military power or economic force, we would be prolonging the injustice and the discrimination that prevailed in the bipolar order that has passed.\nThe time has come to approach seriously the issue of modernising and adapting United Nations mechanisms as a system of collective security. Otherwise we would be condemning n group of countries to an unbridled search for self-protection in the absence of a security system that can protect the weak against the strong.\nI responsibly heed the call of many peace-loving Governments so that our own people's aspiration for democracy can also become a permanent aspiration of the United Nations. The Organisation will not be strengthened unless an agreement is reached to eliminate the right of veto exercised by the permanent members of the Security Council, a right that responded to circumstances and realities that have ceased to exist. This mechanism runs counter to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and limits its effective contributions to collective security.\nThe right to veto Security Council resolutions is a mechanism that limits the achievement of consensus among the Member States of the United Nations. The Security Council must be a representative body, and in no way should any of its members negate the majority view of the United Nations. If we want collective and democratic security, we must aspire to universal egalitarian law.\nI wish to propose formally that this Assembly entrust to a committee of experts the study of new foundations for the organization and functioning of the Security Council. The countries now holding a decisive privilege would be full-fledged permanent members of the Council and the membership might even be expanded. Decisions on collective security would need at least a qualified majority of its members to reflect the general will of the international community.\nLast year I suggested in this forum the convening of a meeting between oil-producing and consumer countries to coordinate the use and production of a resource fundamental to the welfare of our civilisation. In spite of some scepticism, the meeting was held with the explicit and constructive support of President Francois Mitterand. In July this year in Paris, major conclusions were reached as to ways and means of improving information and analysis of the energy world of the future.\nWe also believe that there is an urgent need to achieve a new environmental order. He shall be attending the world conference on the environment in Brazil as a country from the Amazon region and as a member of the Amazon Pact, and we aspire to playing a leading role in the adoption of major global decisions in this respect.\nI cannot but refer to the second summit conference of the Group of Fifteen to be held in Caracas next November. The Group of Fifteen acts as a consulting forum for the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, to coordinate the policies of the South at the international level and to assist in the formulation and implementation of cooperation programmes.\nThe year 1992 will mark the 500th anniversary of the encounter between Europe and America. On our continent, we are preparing o celebrate this event by considering the advances of our own history and its impact. We hope that the rest of the world represented here will share with us the celebration of this important historic event that changed the course of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all. Sir, please accept my warmest congratulations on your election to this high office. We are fully confident that you will carry out the responsibility of your office with great skill and efficiency. The delegation of Liechtenstein wishes you success and pledges to you its full support.\nIt is a great pleasure for me to pay a tribute today to the\nSecretary-General. I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to him for the\n\nfriendship that he has shown to my country even when it was not yet a Member of the United Nations. It was a privilege for us to host his visit to our country a few months ago, and I would like to thank him again for having paid this honour to Liechtenstein. We have much admiration for the excellent leadership he has shown during his 10 years as Secretary-General of the Organization, and I wish to express our gratitude to him and to his staff. Because of the momentous changes in the world and thanks to his efforts, the\n nations is slowly assuming more and more the peace-keeping responsibilities throughout the world in accordance with the original intentions of its founders. We all know, of course, that many further efforts and endeavours are necessary to bring peace and happiness to every region of the world.\nLiechtenstein wishes to welcome the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which joined the Organisation on 17 September. We are convinced that the admission of the two States duly corresponds to the principle of universality expressed in the Charter, as well as to the wish of the Korean people that the process of reunification be expedited.\nMoreover, I wish to extend warm congratulations to the Federated States of Micronesia and to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, as well as to the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on their admission as sovereign and equal members of the United Nations.\nAs the representative of the smallest Member State of the United Nations, I want to thank you for accepting Liechtenstein last year as a Member of this international Organization. Membership of the United Nations is of great significance, especially for small countries like Liechtenstein. The United Nations is a special meeting-place for all countries, some of which do not have representations all over the world. Moreover, United Nations membership gives protection to those countries which are too weak to defend their independence.\nNot every State is fortunate enough to have neighbours like Austria and Switzerland, which have respected the independence of the Principality of Liechtenstein over centuries. I should like to avail myself of this occasion to thank those two countries for all the help and support they have given us throughout our history.\n\nIn the recent past we have been able to witness rapid and almost revolutionary political changes in the world. Tensions between East and West have been greatly reduced. Europe is no longer divided. Solutions to some regional conflicts are closer as ever before. These developments form the background for the new challenges that the world community is facing.\nThe role of the United Nations has changed. The Organisation has entered a new phase. Profiting from the absence of great-Power confrontation, it is acting more efficiently and is concentrating on the cause of peace and security.\n\n\nSmall States have a special need for protection and security. The Principality of Liechtenstein, although it is, fortunately, a prosperous and secure country surrounded by two permanently neutral neighbours, feels that this issue is of direct relevance. Respect for international law is our only protection. For these reasons, we feel deeply committed to the principles of the sovereign equality, political independence and territorial integrity of States. While we were not a Member of the Organization in 1989, we fully support resolution 44/21, in which the General Assembly urged Member States inter alia to settle disputes peacefully, and adhere to the principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nUnfortunately, again and again in the history of mankind we have seen brutal aggressions of one country against another. The aggression of Iraq against its small neighbour Kuwait was just the most recent example in a long list. The peace-loving countries of the world have to be grateful to the United Nations and to the Member States that took part in the military action against Iraq that finally resulted in putting an end to the occupation and preventing the permanent annexation of Kuwait. International law served as \n\t\n\nthe umbrella for the international response to the Gulf crisis, and thus constitutes the most recent proof that respect for its precepts is a small country's only protection. Let us all hope that this crisis was a turning-point in human history, for as long as the United Nations reacts as it did during the Gulf crisis, such aggressions will cease to become attractive instruments for even the most power-hungry dictators.\nUnfortunately, we know that even if we succeed in preventing all acts of aggression, peace and happiness will not come easily to the world. Some of the most cruel wars in the past decades have been civil wars. Politicians and historians can give us many reasons why civil wars occur: different cultures, languages or religions that have difficulty coexisting in a single State, oppressed minorities or simply political differences that cannot be resolved peacefully.\na solution for some of these problems can be found internally if a State respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and has democratic institutions that work. But history shows that even then civil wars can break out. Human rights can also be violated in countries with a democratic tradition. Democratic institutions can break down. There are situations where peaceful coexistence between different groups inside a single State does not seem to be possible, whatever the reasons may be. Should we, in those cases, not endeavour to find other solutions in accordance with the principle of self-determination, rather than risk cruel and destructive civil wars?\nI am aware that the United Nations, for good reasons, has been very prudent concerning the principle of self-determination. To encourage the exercise of the right to self-determination might lead to even more civil wars and to the disintegration of Member States. Non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States has certainly been a wise policy to follow.\nNevertheless, we have to accept the fact that the borders of nearly all Member States, including my own country, have not been drawn according to the principle of self-determination. They are usually the product of colonial expansion, international treaties or war, and very seldom have people been asked where they want to belong. But even if they had been asked, a new generation might have another opinion; circumstances can change and expectations can remain unfulfilled.\nA majority of Member States certainly supports self-determination in theory. How this principle is to be applied in practice has, however, in my opinion, not been studied enough. Usually the discussion starts over a specific case when strong emotions are already involved. Would it not be better at least to try to find a minimum consensus between Member States on some guiding principles, when efforts are being made to implement the principle of self-determination?\nTo be acceptable to the largest possible number of Member States, such guidelines or rules of conduct should foresee a careful evolution, which could start from a low level and go on to higher levels of autonomy before complete independence could be attained. Independence is, however, not always the best solution: it can be a complicated and sometimes traumatic process.\nI wish to inform members of my intention to instruct experts to prepare a preliminary study on this question, the outcome of which would be submitted in due course to the General Assembly, if that was considered desirable. A convention modelled after the European Convention on Human Rights could eventually be the product of these efforts I should like to raise a few points and draw a few lines in order to give the Assembly an overall idea of the possible outline of such an instrument. \nA central question will be to define what entity can be the beneficiary of the right to self-determination. Several methods have been discussed in the past. It might be sufficient to establish the minimum size of the area and population involved. Setting this minimum size very low would have two important advantages! First, minorities that asked for self-determination would consequently have to grant the same rights to their own minorities; experience shows us that they arc at times unwilling to do so, which can be the cause of new problems. Secondly, a low minimum size would, in my opinion, lead to a decentralization rather than to a break-up of the present States, because for small groups and areas independence will not always be the best solution.\nFor a modern State decentralization has political and economic advantages. Decentralization is certainly one of the key elements for the prosperity and political stability of Switzerland, a country without natural resources and a population with four languages, various religions and many political parties.\nA convention on self-determination could foresee several degrees of autonomy before independence were granted to a certain region, thus giving the central State and the region the time to adapt to the new situation, with the likely outcome that the people would in most instances prefer autonomy to independence. Three degrees of autonomy could be envisaged.\nThe first degree could involve the election of representatives for the new autonomous region and consequently the administration by those elected representatives of the funds which are allocated by the central government. Some additional rights could be given in the fields of culture and education.\nThe next step could involve some autonomy in taxation. Direct taxes would probably be raised better by the regions, whereas indirect taxation. \nimport duties and the like could remain with the central government, A financial compensation plan would have to be worked out at this stage, taking into account the income and the administrative functions of the region, which may, for instance, already include the police and the lower courts.\nThe third degree of autonomy could involve some legislative power. Examples can already be studied in some of the decentralized States. At this stage of autonomy most administrative functions of the central State could be turned over to the region, with the exception of defence and foreign affairs. Even regional military units could be set up as long as they were integrated into the overall defence plan.\nThe next step of this process - if it were desired - would be full independence.\nThose States which accepted the general terms of a possible convention on self-determination could envisage setting up an international commission or court comparable to the European Commission and Court for Human Rights, to which all parties concerned could appeal n case of conflicts. Such an approach would offer the possibility to observe how these general guidelines worked in reality and to adjust them if necessary. Other States might then be willing to sign the convention too, and perhaps one day those guidelines on self determination could become generally accepted international law, as other conventions have become.\nIf we look at human history it seams that humanity does not have many alternatives. In the past new States have been born, and new States will be born in the future; States have disappeared or their borders have changed, and that will also happen in the future. If we look at longer periods of time we see that States have life cycles similar to the human beings who created them. The life cycle of a State might last for many generations but hardly \n \n\nany Member State of the United Nations has existed in its present borders for longer than 10 generations. It could be dangerous if one tried to put a hold on these cycles, which have been present throughout human history. To freeze human evolution has in the past often been a futile undertaking and has probably brought more violence than would result if such a process were controlled peacefully.\nConsidering the advances is the field of technology, civil wars will become more and more destructive, not only for those directly involved but also for neighbouring States and for our whole environment. The possible destruction of a large nuclear power plant in a civil war is a frightening example. Would it not be much safer to replace the power of weapons by the power of voting, even if it meant that new States might be born?\nAs the representative of the smallest and one of the youngest Member countries, I wish to thank the Assembly for having given me the opportunity to express my views on a controversial subject and to present ideas related thereto.\nLiechtenstein is proud to be a Member of the United Nations, an Organisation that gives full priority to respect for international law and the principles of its Charter. We shall continue to support all United Nations efforts aimed at realizing international peace and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation extends hearty congratulations to you. Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Your assumption of this high office evinces Saudi Arabia's new and more prominent role in international affairs. Antigua and Barbuda applauds you and I assure you of the firm support of my delegation.\nHe also wish to confer our sincerest commendations on your predecessor. Foreign Minister Guido de Marco of Malta. His skills as a reformer and as a diplomat were made evident throughout the proceedings of the forty-fifth session and his outstanding leadership considerably enhanced the functioning of the machinery of the United Nations. Malta and Saudi Arabia must be congratulated on the outstanding role each has played at the commencement of a decade of great change.\nTen years ago my island country submitted to the Security Council an application for admission to membership in the United Nations. That event marked the end of 350 years of colonial history and the beginning of my people's complete responsibility for their own affairs. After one decade of independence my country is pleased to report that, despite current financial difficulties, it has experienced 10 consecutive years of uninterrupted economic growth, that our gross domestic product has more than doubled since 1981, that personal incomes have shown a corresponding increase, that my country's population growth has been limited to less than 1 per cent per annum, that our infant mortality rate has been significantly reduced, and\n\nthat we have remained peaceful and fairly prosperous. These results were forecast by my Prima Minister, the Bight Honourable Vera Cornwall Bird, who at the dawn of independence promised results in exchange for hard work and discipline.\nAs Antigua and Barbuda celebrates 10 prosperous years of independence and 10 years of United Nations membership, it pleases my delegation to welcome two more island States to membership in this body. The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, as new Members of the United Nations, are assured of the unfailing support of Antigua and Barbuda.\nAll States, whether large or small, powerful or powerless, need the United Nations. But for small States membership in this Organisation is rooted in the need to ensure universal compliance with international law. The safeguarding of the sovereignty of small States can best be assured through an unfailing commitment by all States, especially the large and powerful, to abide always by the rule of law.\nIraq's attempted annexation of its small neighbour Kuwait can be deemed this decade's most flagrant example of total disregard for international law. However, the willingness of the United National Security Council to authorize the use of a coalition force to restore Kuwait's sovereignty is a shining example of the triumph of international cooperation. The United States and the other coalition partners are to be highly commended for their willingness to commit manpower and resources to so noble a cause. Small nations must, however, find an alternate means of deterring aggressors, knowing that large and powerful States may not always be willing to come to the collective defence of economically insignificant, non-oil producing countries. \n\nBut the Iraq-Kuwait crisis nevertheless provided clear evidence that the decades-old rivalry between the world's super-Powers has receded and that the cold war has ended. Further, the crisis in the Gulf also suggested that small States would not be afforded any greater opportunity to help shape world events, except as victims.\nRecent changes in Eastern Europe may, however, have altered that old order of exclusion. The three small Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are held in high esteem for having reasserted their sovereignty without simultaneously receiving a pledge of countervailing super-Power support. \n\nIn fact, many small countries applauded as the courageous citizens of these three small republics, dwelling in the shadow of a giant, challenged another, much mightier than they and prevailed. The President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is duly praised for correcting SO years of injustice which fostering peace. Antigua and Barbuda extends hearty congratulations and a warm welcome to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as new members of this family o sovereign and equal, independent nation-States.\nYet we caution our new Members to bear in mind that ours is a world in which small States are frequently marginalized and therefore wield little influence. Our 10 years of membership in the Organization confirms that the General Assembly remains the principal forum from which small voices can be heard and measured influence exercised; it is the foremost platform for practicing and promoting multilateralism. Antigua and Barbuda will continue to advocate the multilateral approach to problem-solving, convinced that it is the best mechanism for promoting international cooperation and the peaceful coexistence of sovereign States.\nIn our view, the multilateral approach contributed to the planting of democracy in Haiti, and it is this approach that will help uproot the brutal dictatorship that has seized power there. Antigua and Barbuda condemns unreservedly last Monday's military assault on the budding democratic process in Haiti, We urge the international community to continue to give to Haiti's people the support they require for restoring constitutional government. The multilateral approach will surely succeed in removing the usurpers from their perch and reinstating President Aristide to his legitimate office-\n\nWe are also convinced that, it is the continued reliance upon the multilateral approach that has contributed overwhelmingly to the death throes of apartheid in racist South Africa. Apartheid will be dismantled, because the world's nations have decided that such a practice is an evil too pernicious to exist, and until each time as the last vestige of apartheid disappears South Africa cannot expect to be included in this family of nations. Antigua and Barbuda continues to press for the use of sanctions as a means of propelling progress in ending apartheid. A fully democratic South Africa, where each adult has one equal vote, is the sure test of apartheid's demise.\nOur unrelenting efforts to help end apartheid form part of Antigua and Barbuda's sacred commitment to the promotion of human rights. Each year, my delegation also brings to this community's attention the violation of the human rights of the world's indigenous peoples. It is our considered view that the powerless peoples who inhabit the world's shrinking forests and the Earth's remotest corners need United Nations protection if they are not to be brutally exterminated. Land-grabbers, gold-miners, ranchers, logging companies, criminals and countless others have invaded their ancestral homelands, causing death, disease, degradation and massive disruption of traditional life - in short, genocide, misery and violation is the lot of the world's indigenous peoples.\nThe islands of our Caribbean were once the home of several peoples that were virtually eliminated by war and slavery beginning in 1492. If the history of my region is any guide, then we fear the worst for the world's\n\nindigenous peoples. With Increased United Nations protection, however, that brutal history need not be repeated.\nThe equally brutal assault on the Earth's environment, unleashed by humanity since the start of the industrial revolution, cannot continue. The fragile ecological balance that has slowly evolved on our planet during its 3,500-million-year existence now shows extreme signs of wear. That humanity cannot march along on its present course for another 100 years is most evident. Ozone-layer depletion, global warming, sea-level rise, frequent and violent hurricanes, creeping deserts and calamitous climate change threaten mankind's very existence. But the most immediate threats are to low-lying island countries like my own and others in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Ours are the front-line countries that would suffer the severest consequences of even a mild climate change. Island-States like my own, which have inflicted no harm on the environment, now stand in real danger of being submerged in a swollen ocean.\nUnless the world's developed nations radically alter their production methods and their consumer lifestyles, there will be no third and fourth generations upon whom sins can be visited. And united the world's developing nations can acquire and introduce sustainable development technologies, their ever-poorer, ever-expanding human populations will become the hapless victims of environmental disasters too catastrophic to contemplate.\nIsland-States of the world, aware of the unique environmental dangers that face island populations, have united under his common banner here at the United Nations. The Alliance of Small Island States - AoSIS), proposed by Trinidad and Tobago And ably chaired by Vanuatu, has worked diligently to \n\narticulate a common position during the negotiations that will culminate in the convention on climate change. Antigua and Barbuda, as an equal partner in AOSIS, intends to live up to its responsibility in forging this convention. Our delegation will play an ever fuller role in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in June 1992. We hall Brazil for its leadership role in that regard, conscious of the need to address simultaneously the twin issues of environment and development.\nThough the world's eyes are focused on Brazil, Antigua and Barbuda would like to draw some attention to Antarctica. That frozen and unspoiled continent must not become the possession of large States alone; it is our considered view that Antarctica should be brought under the umbrella of control of the United Nations. Antarctica is too important a barometer of the Earth's environmental health, too significant a source of food for all the oceans' fish, too fragile an ecological system to allow it to be raped in the hope of successful exploitation. Industrial activity on Antarctica would tilt further the carbon dioxide imbalance in the atmosphere, drill larger holes in the Earth's protective ozone layer and precipitate global warming and the rise in sea level. \nMy Government is heartened to learn that the 24 voting members of the 30-year-old Antarctic Treaty have signed an agreement which prohibits mining and oil exploration on Antarctica for 50 years. It is agreed that, at the end of this period, the ban could be lifted if two-thirds of the present members of the Treaty concur. My delegation is of the firm view that this agreement successfully curbs this generation's cupidity, which would otherwise imperil severely the good health of every succeeding generation. Antarctica's virginal tundras, unpopulated and undisturbed, ought not ever be violated.\nBut on the Earth's populated continents, a hand of reversal, laden with resources, is needed to save our planet from ecological disaster. My country thus welcomes the heightened awareness displayed by several multilateral funding agencies. In particular, we applaud the World Bank and the United Nations Environment Programme for their establishment of the Global Environmental Facility. Although $250 million will not be nearly sufficient to undo much of the damage inflicted on the environment, the creation of that fund is an admirable start. Further, we wish to urge the establishment of the Global Environment Technology Centre which is intended to oversee the transfer of sound technologies to all developing countries. If we are to hand over our Earth to the next generation with afflictions as few as our forebears handed to us, then the development process must take into account the harm to the environment which technology will inflict.\nThe underdevelopment of Africa is of special concern to my delegation. In 1957, when Kwame Nkrumah brought independence to Ghana, the people of Antigua and Barbuda were duly inspired. He regarded Africa's freedom as a necessary precursor to our own. Equally, we knew that Africa's development \n\nwould herald our own. Since the early years of its independence, however, Africa's commodity earnings have declined considerably; terms of trade have worsened; conspiracies hatched in diverse other places undermined and terminated legitimate African leadership; civil strife fuelled by cold war concerns compromised stability; and. In some places, even the natural elements. Including drought and disease, have seemingly conspired to decimate youthful populations. My delegation is of the firm view that resource flows into Africa must be greatly increased and that the United Nations system must be prepared to play a more significant role in Africa's rejuvenation.\nIsland-developing countries like my own will also look increasingly to the United Nations system for support. The United Nations Development Programme will be expected to increase its funding of projects. The Department of Technical Cooperation for Development will, also be called upon to assume a greater role by expanding the technical expertise which it now provides. Enlarging the functions of these United Nations agencies will require larger contributions from developed countries. Freedom is not free and its promotion requires material gains if it is not to wither away. Here, leadership must take the lead.\nWe applaud the leadership in Angola for its magnanimous overtures to its once committed foes, and we urge the parties in Madagascar to continue to seek a peaceful solution to their crisis. My Government also eagerly awaits the results of the United Nations-supervised referendum on Western Sahara, and we urge respect for the results. Our hearts are with the Saharan people in this, its moment of truth.\nTurning to Asia, we congratulate the two Koreas for the bold step which each has taken in assuming United Nations membership. Antigua and Barbuda \nwelcomes the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to membership in this family of nations. He share the aspirations of the Korean people for a peaceful unification of their divided homeland. Our countrymen share their view that peace is indivisible and, thus, we sincerely hope that the unstable state of armistice which prevails on the peninsula will be replaced by a lasting peace soon.\nMy country is particularly heartened by the recent decisions of the warring factions in Cambodia to reduce their respective military forces by 70 per cent and to place the remainder under the direct supervision of the United Nations. He urge all the parties to strive to overcome their disagreement on holding free elections so as to ensure acceptance of the framework agreement established by the Security Council. Antigua and Barbuda commends the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his sustained efforts aimed at promoting dialogue among the combatants in Afghanistan. He believe this process will lead to a lasting peace. There now appears to be some movement on the question of Cyprus, and we urge inclusion of all the parties in the healing process. Likewise, the Middle East conflict appears to have reached a bend. He remain fixed in our view that an international peace conference should be convened. The interests of all concerned are best served through dialogue and negotiation in an atmosphere dedicated to peaceful resolution. The right of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own must become a reality and Israel must be allowed to exist within secure and accepted borders.\nHe rejoice with the people of Lebanon as its civil war appears to be coming to an end. May that very beautiful country once again retake its place as the region's crossroads of many cultures. The fratricidal war which rages \n\nIn Yugoslavia la regrettable, and we encourage the European Communities to continue to seek a solution thereto. Their success will set an example for other regional groups. If the European Communities fail to settle this dispute, then to their own detriment they will have missed their first rendezvous with history.\nI should like briefly to focus on my own region. He have condemned continuously the unjust economic systems which have caused civil wars to erupt in Central America. Until far reaching economic reforms are instituted. Central America will continue to experience civil strife. Nevertheless, we encourage the parties in El Salvador to enter into negotiations so that peace may reign soon. In that regard, we congratulate the Governments of Guatemala and Belize for seeking an end to their border dispute and for establishing diplomatic relations on a friendly and permanent basis. President Serrano of Guatemala must be congratulated for displaying courage and foresight in a decade ripe for change.\nAs the final decade of the twentieth century unfolds, it is evident that the order which has governed international political and economic affairs over the preceding four decades is no more. Our world is no longer divided into two camps headed by super-Powers armed with competing ideologies. No longer can small or poor nations dart conveniently from one camp to the other in the hope of realizing special economic benefits. The ideological battle is over and so too is the material gain which would accrue to the membership in either c amp. \n\nNo one can tell with certainty what the emerging order holds in store. Hill we inherit a world dominated by a single Power? Or will we inherit a multi polar world with many Powers vying for hearts and minds? Or will we here succeed in fashioning a world where shape and form are given to major events by this our parliament of parliaments? Whatever the new order, my countrymen are acutely aware that ideology and imported economic theory do not guarantee development. 0ur experience teaches that it is the intelligent investment of capital - imported or domestic - and the application of human resources, driven by common-sense values and buttressed by institutions which promote freedom, that work together to assure development.\nOur 10 years of independence have been largely successful because Antigua and Barbuda has had access to capital, and our people have demonstrated an extraordinary dynamism and faith. Within the past two years, however, the sources of capital have begun to shrink. An economic recession in our major capital market has made it increasingly difficult to obtain new investments there from. Official development assistance has simultaneously slowed to a trickle, and our largest foreign-exchange earner was this year battered by a war and a resulting fear of terrorism. Circumstances beyond the control of our policymakers thus threaten to undo 10 successful years of hard work.\nIn 1981, however, when our island country set off into the uncharted sea of independence, our Prime Minister, Vera C. Bird, forecast many storms. We see our current difficulties and our yet-to-be-achieved development goals as a challenge to be overcome by self help and with the assistance of the international community. Antigua and Barbuda gives this community the assurance that 10 years hence in the year 2001 when we report on our\n\n20-year performance, this storm will have passed, this recession will be history, but the institutions, the courage, the faith and the wisdom that have defined the Antigua and Barbuda personality will have prevailed.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, allow me to begin by warmly congratulating you on your election to preside over this forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your elevation to this high office is a demonstration of the confidence which this body has in you as its President. I look forward to working closely with you during your term in office and to a rewarding United Nations General Assembly session under your esteemed leadership. I should also like to express our admiration for the distinguished service rendered by your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta.\nIt is a privilege and honour to stand before this Assembly and address the nations of the world. My message, which has been the consistent theme of past speeches delivered by leaders of the Solomon Islands privileged to speak from this famous rostrum, has been one advocating peace in the world because Solomon Islands believes that this is what the United Nations stands for: \\\"peace in the world, and good will among men\\\". Peace is the source of bountiful goodness from which will come true prosperity and balanced development in the world.\nPeace and freedom for that matter cannot be found in statistics or mathematical equations, nor is it a matter for scientific investigation. It is rather a matter of attitude and belief - a behaviour pattern governed by the mind and from the mind. President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union links world peace and reforms in his own country. The 1990 Nobel Peace Prize winner claims that\n\\\"if perestroika fails, the prospect of entering a new peaceful period in\nhistory will vanish, at least for the foreseeable future\\\".\nSolomon Islands joins other nations in congratulating President Gorbachev end the people of the Soviet Union on their bravery and courage despite confusion and the threat of disintegration brought about by the coup attempt last August. Solomon Islands views with interest and concern the wave of changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe. It welcomes the move towards democratisation that is taking place in the Soviet Union to allow the Baltic Republics to decide their own destinies. It is our hope that, with the process of democratisation already spearheaded by the Soviet Union, the industrialized countries of the West will work together to bring about similar changes in Eastern Europe and other nations of the globe that have aspired to similar reforms.\n\nSmall countries such as Solomon Islands which aspires to better the living environment of its people in the context of international development would therefore ask for understanding and assistance to help us live and develop the way we ourselves want to live and develop and not as others would want us to live.\nThis is of course quite contrary to certain current beliefs and practices in a number of Pacific Islands today. We, the people of the Pacific, would strive to live harmoniously together and not to see the people in some of our islands struggling to live the way others expect us to live. The freedom to live and govern ourselves is the greatest aspiration of our people. What we in small countries ask for is the right to believe in ourselves; the right to make up our own minds; and the right to practise what we believe. These surely are our sovereign rights. We are in the United Nations because we believe in peaceful coexistence and we pledge to play our part in whatever small way we can to assist in the realization of true peace and harmony in the wor1d.\nSometimes It appears that selfishness has overruled godliness and I feel it behoves small countries like Solomon Islands to point that out to the world. I believe it is the duty and function of small countries to do this as bigger nations at times seem to get blinded and tangled up in problems of their own design and making.\nWe have recently seen in the Gulf war the most swiftly executed military victory, on this scale, in history. The United Nations played an important role in that victory and continues today to play a leading peace-keeping role in the aftermath of that war.\n\nMay I humbly suggest, however, that this world will not see the last of military warfare and confrontation of this nature as long as wealthy countries continue to manufacture and sell weapons of destruction around the globe, proliferating what the Prime Minister of Norway in her speech to this Assembly two weeks ago called on \\\"arms culture\\\" in the world.\nWithin some false notion of greatness and economic well-being, some countries continue to manufacture and sell destructive weapons harmful to mankind. By doing this they are in fact abusing their God-given talents in searching for destructive weapons rather than for peaceful ends, yet they pride themselves in the achievement of these destructive powers at the price of human life.\nIronically they justify this abuse of human talent and knowledge as being necessary for man's survival. Some would indeed argue that it is necessary for the protection of freedom that democratic nations should at least keep abreast of the developments in the manufacture of effective deadly weapons so as to be in a state of vigilant preparedness.\nPersonally, I would rather stand by the Word of the Lord and say: \\\"they that take the sword shall perish with the sword\\\". (The Holy Bible, Matthew 26:52)\nSo he who believes in nuclear bombs and nuclear weapons will be destroyed by them.\nThe end of the cold war between the super-Powers should in itself be a timely reminder and a clear message to the rest of the world about the fallacy of relying on the power of atomic bombs and nuclear weapons as instruments of peace.\nThe recent successful efforts by the United States and the Soviet Union towards disarmament and weapons reduction are praiseworthy. Mr. Bush deserves the highest commendation of this world body for his leadership in the bold steps he unilaterally took recently in cutting down United States nuclear arsenals of destruction, as does the refreshing and encouraging positive response from Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet Union during the last few days. The world greeted such good news as bringing fresh hopes of peace, only to be stunned at the knowledge of the apparent ability of certain countries to enrich the uranium supply for the manufacture of nuclear bombs, and to cast doubts once more on the future of the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the possibility of halting the spread of atomic weapons in the world.\nBe that as it may, Solomon Islands would still say that all nations should by now have signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If France and China can now commit themselves to becoming parties to the Treaty, why not the rest of us for the sake of world peace?\nIn the field of environment and environmental control, which has emerged in the past few years as a subject of special interest capturing world-wide attention at this time (albeit perhaps a little too late in some parts of the world), developing countries are taking stock of the damage done to their natural habitat in the Indiscriminate exploitation of their land and sea resources by unscrupulous foreign business interests seeking quick fortunes in logging, mining and fishing ventures.\nIn the South Pacific, our seas have been plundered unmercifully with huge purse-seines and ugly drift-nets that scoop up every living sea - and sometimes land - creature in their paths, discarding in their wake tangled masses of net-meshing, which have become known as \\\"walls of death\\\", trapping all fish and mammal species to death. Our hills and valleys have become denuded of forest trees and foliage, with no attempt by the \\\"exploiters\\\" in most cases at re-forestation in the aftermath to replenish nature's handiwork.\nIn many instances, we who live in the developing countries are blamed for the destruction of our environment and have been harassed about the need not to pollute our seas and air, when it is well known that it is the industrialised countries that are mainly responsible for the destruction of the environment.\nIn a \\\"business-as-usual world\\\" - a concept harboured and jealously protected by one or two of the most industrialized nations for political and economic reasons - global warming and greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere continue at rates unprecedented in human history. And, alas, it is now well established in scientific research circles that it is we, the inhabitants of the island countries of the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Oceans and our children of the future, who live four feet above the sea-water level, who will first disappear from the face of the Earth in the event of sea-level rise in four or five generations hence.\nThe trend shows that man is no longer part of nature, in which he could feel and live harmoniously in a natural environment with the flowers, birds and animals. The anarchist tendency in man has risen above his natural self so that he forgets who he really is, destroying his environment and eventually himself. The burning oilfields of Kuwait continue to tell us this tale, spewing black smoke and poisonous gases into the atmosphere for years to come.\nThe island countries of the Pacific, in particular, are looking forward to a successful outcome of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in June 1992, and hope: (a) that the proposed Agenda 21. a wide-ranging instrument containing objectives, activities and measures of implementation for specific action proposals, will be agreed upon by all Member States, and will serve as a binding agenda, reflecting a political commitment of all Member States to achieve sustainable development, both nationally and internationally; (b) that all Member States agree to the proposed Earth/Rio Charter, which should declare the general principles by which governments and peoples should conduct themselves in relation to each other and to the environment and ensure our common future in both environmental and developmental terms; (c) that an effective framework Convention on Climate Change will be achieved, containing appropriate commitments and addressing all sources of the problem, including sea-level rise and greenhouse gases; and (d) that there will be agreement on the principles for the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests, leading also to another related framework convention.\nIn this regard, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) at the United Nations has already been playing an active role and has made notable inputs in the negotiations during the First and Second International Negotiating Committee meetings, held, respectively, in Washington, D.C. in February 1991 and in Geneva in June 1991, and again in Nairobi during the third meeting that ended last week. Future sessions will be held in Geneva and possibly in New York at later dates. At the same time, small island States have actively participated in the previous sessions of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and will continue to do so at its fourth and final Preparatory Committee meeting next March and at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992.\nWith such a background scenario of the world we live in, one wonders about the meaning of a \\\"new world order\\\" as advanced by our world leaders and as coined by the President of the United States of America. Mr. Bush gave assurance in this Assembly two weeks ago that his vision of the new order does not include the notion of pax americana. However, as a small country, Solomon Islands is still concerned.\nDoes it mean a shift of allegiances and control among the bigger Powers of the Earth in a rezoning of our world into new regional spheres of influence, or is it to be a vision of cooperation and common world endeavours, in which all countries, big and small, contribute to peaceful coexistence and harmonious living?\nIs it a new order in which the more powerful nations strengthen their stranglehold over others less fortunate so as to dictate and rule through dominance of the latest technologies in military power maintained in strategic areas around the world, where it would be relatively easy for them to jeopardize other initiatives from within that could bring about alternative peaceful lifestyles?\nThe worst scenario would be a new world order in which military priorities rule over world spending of billions of dollars, while millions of people starve and die from want of food, better housing and living conditions. It is very sad to see human beings in our streets being degraded to homelessness, not necessarily - as it is often said - because of some brain injury or sickness; not even because of drugs, since drugs art in many cases the result, not the cause, of the problem. Homelessness is caused by wrong economic orientation and planning, not necessarily social disorder, and certainly not because of a lack of human intelligence.\nWhat will the new world order mean in terms of trade development and economic prosperity in a world climate of today, in which the United States of America sees a free trade zone for the Americas to include Canada, Mexico and eventually countries of South America, while Europe - now to Include the new nations of the Eastern bloc - talks of a consolidation of the European Community into one mould, exercising new freedoms of movement and monetary arrangements hitherto unknown?\nWhat will happen in Asia, with its teeming millions of people, and what role will the adjacent island country of Japan play as the most powerful and economically successful nation in the world today?\nAnd where and how will the small island countries of the Pacific region manage in a world in which the bigger countries appear to be creating exclusive economic and possibly military defensive zones for themselves?\nIndeed, this very concern touches fundamentally the issue of the protection and security of the world's small States. The United Nations Charter contains many articles which, if effectively implemented, would provide certain reassurances in the safeguarding and security of small States, especially the small Island developing countries of the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian oceans.\nIn particular. Members of the United Nations should facilitate the implementation of Chapter VII - Articles 39 to 51 - of the Charter, designed specifically to deal with the existence of any threat to peace, breach of peace or act of aggression under the mandate of the Security Council. The Secretary-General should play a more active role in the spirit of Article 99, so that in cases of low-level security threats, for example, he could positively respond to requests from small States, feeling themselves to be under some threat from other States, by immediately sending missions or alternatively officials of the United Nations Secretariat to assess the situations in those countries. Such action would indeed give the United Nations a peace-making as well as a peace-keeping role.\nAt a workshop on the protection and security of small States, sponsored by the Commonwealth Secretariat and held in the Maldives from 5 to 6 May 1991, it was recommended that serious consideration be given to the establishment of either a permanent or an ad hoc United Nations force that could be activated under Chapter VII of the Charter for international security needs. It was also suggested at the meeting that a United Nations force of a rapid-response nature, under the direct control of the Secretary-General, be established to meet, on request, the security needs of small States. The activation of such a force could be at the initiative of the Secretary-General in consultation with the Security Council.\nPresident Bush proposed at last year's General Assembly that the United Nations strengthen its ability to respond positively to requests from Member countries by providing electoral assistance, which up to now has been done on an ad hoc basis, as in the cases of Nicaragua and Haiti. Solomon Islands strongly supports the United States President's proposal and at the same time would ask that similar consideration and commitment be given by the United Nations to the protection and security of small States in line with what I have just outlined.\nAfter all, it is likely that more countries would be seeking assistance for protection and security than would need electoral assistance. Furthermore, since last year's resolution 45/150 was adopted by the General Assembly, it would be quite in order this year to formulate a resolution to accommodate such sentiments as I have outlined on the issue of the protection and security of small States. Solomon Islands is determined to work with the Republic of Maldives in formulating such a resolution, which we believe will have universal acceptance in this world body. It is most encouraging to read the Secretary-General's report, which recognized the intrinsic characteristics of these small States needing special measures for attention and support and which pointed out that the international community has a vested interest in safeguarding their interests. Small States certainly have a limited capacity to provide for their own security. Such a resolution would be complementary to the resolution suggested by Japan on the establishment of a United Nations reporting system to enhance the transparency of international dealings in arms-transfers and world-wide security issues.\nFinally, in the South Pacific region, life remains ostensibly the same when seen from afar - comparatively simple, peaceful and calm. Yet perhaps this is why we should be more concerned, because it could mean we are going backwards rather than forwards, since nothing can remain static In this world. The twenty-second South Pacific Forum Communiqu\u00e9 issued after the Pohnpei meeting in the Federated States of Micronesia held on 29 to 30 July 1991, reiterated the main concerns of the region to bet economic development and trade prospects; environment with special emphasis on sea-level rise; security as it would affect the whole region; decolonization; and the region's approach to global issues. I have to a certain extent already elaborated on aspects of these same issues earlier in my statement.\nOur people continue, for example, to be concerned greatly over the practice of driftnet fishing and dismayed by the French bomb tests in our waters. These grievances are as great today as they were yesterday and in yesteryears. He are therefore heartened to learn of attempts in the United States Congress - both in the Senate and the House of Representatives - to legally outlaw driftnettinq, which has become regarded as the scourge of our seas in the Pacific.\nHe are happy that, in our part of the world, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were recommended for membership by the Security Council in its resolution 702 (1991) and consequently admitted by this Assembly in the early part of this session as full Members of the United Nations. Solomon Islands is confident that this world body will in the near future see a reunification of these two nations as one democratically governed nation, since they are in fact one people.\nSolomon Islands also welcomes the admission of the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to membership of the United Nations. We look forward to working closely with the new States as they take their rightful places amongst all nations represented here.\nWe are delighted at the same time to welcome the admission of our neighbouring Pacific Island countries of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands as full Members of the United Nations. It strengthens our faith in the United Nations as being truly concerned with the wishes of people in the world who genuinely desire independence and the opportunity to govern themselves. Solomon Islands looks forward to working closely with our brothers and sisters of these two young nations both here at the United Nations and in our region home in the Pacific.\nOn the other hand, we continue to be greatly disappointed with France for its nuclear-testing programme in the Pacific. We therefore once again call on France to put an end to this programme. Moreover the recent \\\"knighting\\\" of the Rainbow Warrior Mafart, while at the same time appearing to be saluting his award with another bomb blast at Mururoa Atoll, is a crowning act of selfish defiance and belittling by France of the South Pacific nations' concern for their environment and legitimate rights of livelihood.\nMrs. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in answer to a question from the audience while delivering a lecture at the Economic Club of New York held at the Empire State Building on 19 June of this year, said: \\\"the French have protective tendencies\\\". Our experience of the French colonial attitude in the South Pacific as demonstrated in New Caledonia has taught us people of the region that this is very true, and we regret very much that, as history reveals, all the good and admirable French flavour and lifestyle are likely in the end to he lost in our region because of this attitude, as has happened elsewhere in other parts of the world.\nOn the question of independence for New Caledonia, Solomon Islands was proud to be a member of the Ministerial Mission mandated by the South Pacific Forum to visit the Territory. We are grateful for the cooperation received from the French Government and the interested groups within the Territory during the Mission's deliberations.\nThe report of that Ministerial Mission, which I hope will be distributed to this body soon, highlights positive steps taken by France in implementation of the Matignon Accord, in particular its cooperation with all sectors of the population to promote equitable socio-political and economic development in the Territory. Solomon Islands sees these measures as a move in the right direction and encourages France to continue discussion with all the parties involved in New Caledonia in preparation for an act of self-determination consistent with the United Nations principles and practices, in which nil options, including independence, would be open, and which would safeguard the rights of the indigenous Kanak and other New Caledonians. Solomon Islands would like to see greater interaction between Hew Caledonia and the independent countries of the South Pacific. It supports the call by the South Pacific Forum for increasing contacts and for participation by New Caledonia and other French Pacific Territories in the Forum-initiated advisory committees, meetings, seminars and workshops.\nThe Solomon Islands Government welcomes the positive developments within South Africa. We look forward to the time when the phenomenon of apartheid will truly be extinct and a united, non-racial South Africa will be accepted into this community of nations. However, while we commend President De Klerk for the steps he has taken to dismantle apartheid, black South Africans continue to be deprived of their rights, their freedom and their lives. My Government reiterates its full support for the maintenance of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa until there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible change in South Africa.\nSolomon Islands welcomes the new developments in the attempts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem. He urge all parties concerned to cooperate in reaching as quickly as possible a resolution of that conflict.\nAs the term of office of the Secretary-General will soon come to an end, I should like to pay a tribute on behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands to this eminent person. Mr. Perez de Cuellar's long association with this Organization in various capacities is well known, and his leadership in his present capacity has been outstanding and deserves the highest praise of the Assembly. Mr. Perez de Cuellar came as the Secretary-General at a time when the challenges facing the United Nations were immense. The accomplishments during his term in office. Including the adoption of a plan for the termination of the Iran-Iraq war, the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements, the withdrawal of Soviet Union forces from Afghanistan, and the bringing of independence to Namibia, demonstrate Mr. Peres de Cuellar's outstanding diplomatic skills and able leadership. He will be leaving behind a world body more optimistic about its role and more hopeful for world pence. May I wish him great successes in the future.\nI should like to conclude by emphasizing that all Member countries here at the United Nations, big or small, are admitted as equal partners in an endeavour to preserve and protect all that is good for our people of the world - as our Charter reminds us: \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .. . and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person\\\" - and the right of freedom for all mankind. The United Nations of the 1990s has shown its coming of age in fulfilling certain obligations of the Charter, as with the recent developments in the Middle East crisis. Member countries appear to have regained their sense of balance in favour of shared interest in promoting the well-being of the peoples of the world. Adversaries of the recent past have found the humility and strength to put aside their differences in favour of acting and speaking together for the general good of mankind.\nToday the spirit, of glasnost and transparency has opened the door for optimism about the future of mankind. I pray that this world body does not miss this opportunity to build a world community which will be the pride of nations and our children of the future.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election is clear recognition of the importance of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the world of today in general and in its own region in particular. I am confident that your many years of experience at the United Nations will prove invaluable in guiding this most important session to its fruitful conclusion. I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, for the skilful manner in which he steered the work of the forty-fifth session.\nI would further like to welcome to our ranks the seven new Member States. We look forward to closely cooperating with them for the furtherance of our common objectives. Not since 1960, when the Republic of Cyprus was among 16 new Members, has the United Nations admitted so many Members at one session.\nDuring the last 12 months, the vast changes set in motion on the international political scene have continued at a pace which defies imagination. The forces of democracy are marching forward, brushing aside those who wish to cling to the past. This process has freed the international community from the handcuffs of the former East-West divide and created a new spirit of international solidarity and cooperation.\nThis spirit of cooperation successfully passed its first major test posed by the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait. The human suffering and destruction caused by the occupation of Kuwait and the ensuing Gulf war proved to us all that even more important than addressing aggression is the need to create a system of making such acts of aggression impossible and of helping to reverse similar situations that still persist. Conflict prevention and conflict resolution have always been and continue to be major objectives of the United Nations. In this respect, I would like to emphasize the historic significance of the Charter of Paris and the role that the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe can play in the future in safeguarding peace and respect for human rights in Europe.\nWe all know that a just world is one in which international law is respected and applied. Therefore, we all have an obligation to apply the rule of law and the appropriate process of peaceful settlement of disputes, including recourse to the International Court of Justice, and to refrain from imposing the will of the stronger.\nWe are witnessing daily scenes of suffering, loss of innocent life and blatant violations of human rights in the name of asserting misguided nationalist aspirations. If this process is left unchecked, we run the danger of seeing the mosaic o\u00a3 existing international order being shattered into a multitude of micro-entities. It is an illusion to believe that the creation of entities with an exclusive ethnic, religious or tribal character is the way to a world of happiness and prosperity. On the contrary, human experience has shown that greater progress has been recorded by those multi-ethnic and multi-confessional societies in which all groups were enjoying equal opportunities in a democratic environment.\nThe international community must not hesitate in sending out a resounding message to those tempted to exploit or exacerbate ethnic grievances as a means to power. Differences must be settled by peaceful means and we must never forget that it is through democracy and strict respect for the human rights of all individuals, irrespective of their ethnic identity, that we can redress the grievances of the past and build a new free world society.\nHowever, if extreme nationalism is not to be condoned, the exploitation of ethnic and religious differences in order to promote one country's own strategic or other interests against a smaller one is unforgivable and should be condemned. Yet in Cyprus, for 17 years now we have continued to suffer the results of the invasion by Turkish forces, which continue to occupy nearly 37 per cent of our territory, thus dividing our country in two and creating the present status quo. The facts are that 200,000 people - equivalent to a third of the population - were uprooted from their ancestral homes and properties; 1,619 missing persons are still unaccounted for. Around 70,000 illegal Turkish settlers, brought over to the occupied area to alter the demographic character of the Island, by the shear magnitude of their number threaten the very existence of the Turkish Cypriot community these are the realities of the Cyprus problem, and this is why the status quo has been and continuous to be condemned by the whole world as unacceptable.\nThis is also why the United Nations and the Secretary-General have been labouring hard in order to promote a solution. At no time during the last three years was the world community as hopeful that a solution of the Cyprus problem was close at hand as it was this summer. The Cyprus problem was promoted from the back burner to the forefront of global affairs. I would like on this occasion to express my thanks and appreciation to all the world leaders who have taken a personal interest, and in particular to President George Bush for his determination to act as a catalyst and contribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. His determination in this regard, as well as that of many other leaders, was reiterated from this very rostrum at this session. \nIt was on 2 August this year, on the anniversary of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, that President Bush, after consulting the Secretary-General, President Ozal and Prime Minister Mitsotakis, announced the holding of an international meeting on Cyprus by the end of September. There were two provisos in President Bush's announcement: that the meeting would take place only after adequate progress was registered, and that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Security Council, would determine the composition of the meeting. He assured the Secretary-General of our determination to abide by the process agreed upon and in earnest pursued our cooperation with him and his Representatives. The Secretary-General's representatives visited Ankara twice. They brought ideas and views from Ankara which we started to discuss. It soon transpired, however, that the Turkish Cypriot leadership was raising augmented preconditions for the continuation of the process. All the members of this Assembly will recall that a high-level meeting held under the mandate of the Secretary-General in February and March 1990 collapsed when the Turkish Cypriot side set forth unacceptable preconditions claiming a separatist right to self-determination, which were completely rejected by the Secretary-General in his report and the subsequent Security Council resolution 649 (1990). This time they added a new dimension to their untenable positions by claiming sovereignty, in complete contravention of all relevant Security Council resolutions and particularly resolutions 541 (1983), 550 (1984) and 649 (1990).\nAlmost in parallel, the Turkish Prime Minister publicly reneged on all the commitments of his Government to the United Nations and others concerning elements for progress towards a solution of the Cyprus problem, at the same time announcing that the September date for an international meeting was no longer feasible - not surprising in the circumstances. \nIn a vain attempt to justify their behaviour, they supplied the media with a barrage of suggestions for contacts and high-level meetings. Let me tell the Assembly that for years the Turkish military authorities have been forbidding Turkish Cypriots to have any contact with their Greek Cypriot compatriots. Dozens of groups comprising doctors, teachers, trade unionists, youth groups and politicians are the victims of a heartless application of separatism. Even sick persons are often prohibited from visiting a hospital to obtain special treatment. Let me also explain that whenever the international community points an accusing finger at the leadership of the Turkish side for non-compliance with the agreed process, they attempt to get out of their commitments by making alternative proposals on procedure, ignoring the fact that the first rule of negotiations is to stick to agreements.\nAll these years we have spared no efforts in the guest for a solution and have shown the maximum degree of cooperation with the Secretary-General and his representatives. We are motivated in our efforts by the belief that solution of the Cyprus problem will benefit not only the Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike but also Turkey and Greece and, in addition, promote security in the Mediterranean and Europe. What is even more important is that a solution will demonstrate that differences can be bridged and trust can be repaired. We are steadfast in our objective of promoting a solution which will allow the two communities to live and work together in peace and security in a united federal Cyprus, where economic prosperity will be shared by all and human rights and fundamental freedoms ill be universally applied.\nUnfortunately, the anticipation of a change in the Turkish attitude and policies, which the international community was led to believe was at hand turned out to be a mirage. In all its positions, the Turkish side unyieldingly insists on the maintenance and legitimization of the status quo. One cannot but feel that the guiding principle of Turkish policy remains that the military power shall impose its will. It is the continuous presence of Turkish troops that perpetuates the Cyprus problem. At a time in history when the world has demanded and secured the withdrawal of foreign troops from all countries, it is an anachronism for the Turkish forces to remain and continue the forcible division of the island.\nAre we frustrated by the lack of progress? Yes, we are. Will we give up? No, certainly not. We are in duty bound to the people of Cyprus, to the people of our region and to the people of the world to continue to strive for a just and viable solution which brings peace, security and a better life to all Cypriots throughout the island. To this we remain committed and we shall not be derailed from our ultimate goal.\nThe anachronism of the continued division of Cyprus is highlighted even more when contrasted with the reunification of Europe and the substantial progress made towards finding solutions to the problems in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Western Sahara and El Salvador,\nThe Republic of Cyprus welcomes the recent developments in South Africa as definite steps in the right direction but maintains its belief that only when South Africa is fully transformed into a non-racial, democratic and unified country, where basic human rights and freedoms are enjoyed by all, can South Africa truly enjoy peace.\nWe are also encouraged by the fact that in the Middle East there have been positive developments in a number of areas. Substantial progress has been made towards the convening of an international peace conference, which will, it is hoped, pave the way for the people of Palestine end Israel to enjoy peace and security. We are further encouraged by the ending of civil strife and the dismantling of barricades in Lebanon, as well as the anticipated end of the tragedy of the remaining hostages. I am certain that members here all share with me the feelings of appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts in this direction.\nWhatever progress we have made on the road to democracy and the consolidation of world peace will not be built on sound foundations unless we come to grips with the disastrous repercussions of the growing gap between North and South.\nFigures may not mean much, but I should like to point out that behind the statistics showing that 77 per cent of the population of this planet accounts for only 15 per cent of its income in hidden the continuing tragedy and suffering of more than one billion human beings living in abject poverty and destitution. In recent years we have all talked at length about the debt crisis. However, the debt problem not only persists but is becoming far worse. What counts even more than the fact that the total debt is in excess of $1.2 trillion is that during the last three years the net transfer of resources from developing countries to developed countries accounted for nearly $200 billion. I do not know who is helping whom! Equally catastrophic, in its effects, is the wall of protectionism that is erected. For agricultural and textile products alone, this costs the developing countries approximately $150 billion annually and further reduces their share of the world market, which has declined by about one fifth in recent years.\nThree years ago, from this very rostrum, I suggested that we could address the problem of development only by diverting funds from military expenditure. At that time this may have sounded like a Utopian's dream. Today we all know that military expenditure, both in the developed world and in the developing world, can be dramatically reduced. Let us now translate what was then a dream into reality.\nWhatever sums of money we may spend on development, however, will bring no results unless we make sure that the products that we help the third-world countries to produce are allowed to reach consumers in the developed world. We know that free trade is the precondition for a healthy world economy, but the sad reality is that the Uruguay Round has still to be completed - with a delay of more than a year - and in the last few years, whilst the poor\ncountries have been opening up their markets, the rich countries have been erecting store and more barriers.\nEnvironmental destruction is the other major danger that humanity is threatened with. Ironically, this is a result of both uncontrolled development in the industrialised world and inadequate development in the developing world. Available data leave us no room for complacency, as the deteriorating situation must be arrested and reversed immediately. The environment is the common heritage of mankind, transcending national boundaries. Its global nature requires global solutions. The Conference on the Environment and Development planned for 1992 is particularly important as it is expected to identify and develop global strategies to safeguard the future of our planet. To achieve this, however, we need not only resolutions but also large sums of money, which can be secured only through the establishment of an environment fund.\nThe United Nations today enjoys a position of prominence in world affairs - no longer impeded by the East-West divid. order to fulfil its role and meet the many challenges we are facing, the United Nations must not only have the support of all Member States - such support is indispensable - but also restructure and revitalize its organization. We are heartened to note that in the area of peace-keeping we have seen the United Nations become actively involved in previously uncharted areas. The Republic of Cyprus knows better than most the invaluable services that the United Nations peace-keeping missions offer, and I wish to take this opportunity to express again our thanks and appreciation to the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and to all involved with its mission.\nOver the last decade the United Nations has been fortunate to have as its Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. Throughout his tenure the United Nations has been steered by an experienced and seasoned diplomat, whose dedication in advancing the purposes and principles of the United Nations is recognised by all. We congratulate him and wish him every success in the future. Cyprus has first-hand experience, over many years, of the skills and devotion that characterise the Secretary-General, and I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our unflinching support for his efforts to find a solution for the Cyprus problem.\nOur generation is witnessing an unprecedented acceleration of history, which affects all the fields of human experience. The end of the cold war has freed the world from the narrow confines of Power-bloc considerations. Yet permanent peace is not fully in our grasp. An international community working within a metamorphosed United Nations can combat the ills and inequalities of our society. The United Nations, however, can be only as effective as the input that it receives from each and every one of us.\nLet us, then, show, here at this General Assembly, that the remnants of the past order of inequality and strife have been buried. In its place, permanent peace, security and development for all must be the guiding force of our future actions. We ourselves are the jury, and our verdict will determine whether we shall be freed to a better future or condemned to a more dismal past.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure for me to speak for the first time from the rostrum of the United Nations as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Government of National Union and Transition, which arose out of the Sovereign National Conference. I thus bear an historic responsibility to inform the international community of the conclusions of this great gathering of the vital forces of our nation.\nI should like first to say how pleased I am personally, and on behalf of my delegation, to convey to Mr. Shihabi of Saudi Arabia our warm congratulations on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-sixth session. By bestowing on him unanimously the weighty mission of guiding its work, the General Assembly wished to pay a tribute to his country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which the Republic of the Congo, my country, maintains friendly relations. His election is also proof of the recognition by the Assembly of his outstanding qualities as a statesman and diplomat whose talent and experience provoke the admiration of all and augur well for the outcome of our work.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, we should like to express our thanks and gratitude for the wisdom, competence and effectiveness with which he presided over the meetings of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The Congo, which was part of the General Committee of the General Assembly at that time, was able from that privileged position to appreciate his remarkably fresh approach to the activities of the Organisation, particularly with regard to its laborious reform process.\nTo the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, I should like to reiterate our constant support and encouragement for his tireless efforts for peace. He welcome his dynamic work at the head of the Organisation, which today has seen restored its prestige, validity and credibility, which lie at the basis of great works.\nWith the admission of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Baltic Republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to membership of our Organization, the role of the United Nations in international affairs has been further strengthened. We welcome with joy and pride this event which is a new and striking illustration of the irreversible march of the United Nations towards its goal of universality.\nThe work of the forty-sixth session is taking place at a further decisive turning-point for the Organization. There is no more eloquent argument in this respect than the successful mobilization over the past few years of collective action for the settlement of certain disputes which have long been deadlocked and which have been placed before the United Nations. This refurbished image is the result of the disappearance of cold-war antagonisms and the bipolarisation of international relations - a bipolarisation which had immobilised the United Nations for four decades.\nThe adoption of a settlement plan for the Iran-Iraq conflict and, among other successes, the settlement of the complex question of Namibia and the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops from Namibia and Angola, have made it possible for the United Nations to be considered as an actor worthy of confidence on the international scene.\nThere is general agreement that progress has also been made as regards the situations in Afghanistan, Cambodia, El Salvador and Western Sahara. The functioning and ability of the Organisation, moreover, have been crucial in the process that put an end to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. However, we could not fail to note that the outbreak of hostilities in the Gulf showed that the Security Council authorized coercive action, not as provided for in Article 42 and succeeding Articles of Chapter VII of the Charter, but on the basis of an international coalition.\nThe fact remains that, with the involvement of the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United Nations determined a favourable outcome of this war. The central role it was destined to play by the founding fathers regarding international peace and security has thus been brought to the forefront. The world, already more than a year into the last decade of the twentieth century, is caught up in a turmoil of spectacular upheavals unforeseen by mankind, despite its fertile imagination.\nThe international community lived through 50 years of certainty, when order reigned in Eastern Europe, but six years of perestroika have upset the balance. This happened first in the Soviet Union, where many citizens gradually shed their fear and rediscovered the courage to discuss and criticise, and also to display renewed nationalist outbursts or to have dreams of identifying their peoples with Western development models.\nThis new Soviet revolution spread to Eastern Europe, awakening the profound and legitimate aspirations to freedom of many peoples long bundled up together under the Communist regime. Democracy and human rights have been progressively affirmed wherever authoritarianism, dictatorship, a one-party political system and arbitrariness once stifled fundamental freedoms.\nMembers will not be surprised to hear me state a bold opinion about the democratic wind that is blowing through Africa and in particular the Republic of the Congo. It is true that some of the changes that have occurred, which have established dialogue and democratic debate in many African States, remain dependent on international pressures and the major international financial institutions, both as investors and bilateral partners. However, we should not underestimate internal factors and conditions.\nInternational opinion is aware of the special mechanism in Africa of the national conference, which has made it possible to implement, with variations for each country and each people, the general outline of the democratic process flourishing elsewhere. My country, the Republic of the Congo, is part of the great movement that is today sweeping Africa, Asia and Central America; it held its own sovereign National Conference, a fraternal forum, lasting 105 days, attended by 1,200 representatives of all the nation's driving forces and people of good will. The Conference was held in Brazzaville from 25 February to 10 June this year, in the presence of foreign observers.\nThere was a democratic debate, with contributions by political parties born of political liberalisation, professional associations, organisations of young people and women, scientific societies, religious groups, former Heads of State and other national notables - in brief, the vital forces of the Congolese nation, moved by their common destiny, in a national upsurge. That debate was complete and decisive, but typical of the African type of debate, which combines the virtue of dialogue with the wisdom of compromise.\nHaving taken stock in all areas, the National Conference, in full sovereignty, concluded that administration by the one-party political system had failed, and it adopted a fundamental law which constitutes a provisional Constitution for the Republic for a transitional period of 12 months.\nThe fundamental law provides for a tripartite division of constitutional powers, in the Congolese style of coexistence. The President of the Republic, who represents the nation, is the Head of State. But his powers have been reduced. In particular, the President of the Republic exercises the diplomatic competences of the State.\nThe Prime Minister, Head of Government, is elected by the National Conference. This is a first in our political history. His position is also strengthened by devolution to him of the important functions of Head of the Armed Forces.\nWith regard to legislative aspects, a Higher Council of the Republic has been set up, with power to follow up the decisions of the National Conference. The Higher Council of the Republic can overturn the Government by passing a motion of censure. The powers of the judiciary, independent of the executive and the legislature, rests with the Supreme Court and other national courts, under the control of the High Council of the Judiciary. It should also be noted that we have established a High Court of Justice, which will pass judgement if any crimes and offences are committed by members of the Higher Council of the Republic and members of the transitional Government. The President of the Republic can be brought before that body if accused of high treason.\nThe National Conference also produced a number of national charters of rights; it adopted a charter of rights and freedoms guaranteeing each citizen the right to material well-being and offering a legal framework for this moral and spiritual development.\nMoreover, we had the foresight to include in the fundamental law a provision concerning civil disobedience in the event of any individual or group of individuals seizing power by force. The latest political developments in the Soviet Union and Haiti confirm that we were right to look ahead in that way. He also agreed on a charter of national unity. That was the first step we had to take. The most difficult phase, that of implementing those rights, has only just begun.\nThe range of significant measures taken by the sovereign National Conference includes a timetable for elections, which will begin in November this year with the holding of a constitutional referendum and end with presidential elections next June, the proposed end of the transitional period. Local and parliamentary elections are scheduled for January to March next year. Implementing this timetable will lay the foundations for democratic life in the Congo.\nI must again draw the Assembly's attention to two types of measures taken by my country's National Conference, which some observers emphasised was the longest exercise of its kind in Africa.\nFirst, we are preserving the symbols of the Republic. The Conference re-adopted the first symbols used at the time of the Congo's proclamation of independence in Brazzaville in I960. That makes it possible for us to revive the dream of building a fraternal Congolese nation, united in working for economic and social progress. Thus the People's Republic of the Congo, my country, has again become the Republic of the Congo.\nThe national emblem is the rectangular tricolour flag - green, yellow and red. The national anthem is \\\"La Congolaise\\\", and the Republic's motto has again become \\\"Unity, work, progress\\\".\nNational independence, peace, friendship and good-neighbourliness, as well as respect for the principles of non-alignment, remain the foundations of the foreign policy of the Republic of the Congo. We base ourselves on these principles in order to establish links of cooperation with all the nations of the world that love peace and are working in harmony with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nThose principles guide the humanitarian action of the Republic of the Congo, a land of peace and hospitality, which, despite its economic and financial difficulties, has done everything possible, in cooperation with other countries, to facilitate the repatriation to their countries of origin of many foreign nationals following recent events in our subregion.\nThe success of that operation was made possible by the climate of peace that reigns in my country and the political maturity of our people who, following the sovereign National Conference understand, thanks to the process of democratisation under way, the need for peoples that love democracy and freedom to support each other. I should like to take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to give its support to the young democracies of Africa - for man cannot live by democracy alone; he must also have bread, clothing and housing. While it is certainly true that to have bread one must first have freedom, democracy is not the end of the process of social and economic development. This is one of the most urgent problems of international cooperation. While it is indisputable that democracy is a point of departure and a sine qua non for development, it cannot take root and flourish in an environment of mass poverty where persistent economic degradation and social decay suggest to some that the African continent is doomed to a certain destiny.\nThe economic and financial crisis that my country is going through was at the centre of the concerns of the national sovereign Conference. Consideration of the economic agenda led to the conclusion, inter alia, that over the last few years there has been a marked deterioration in the budgetary situation, exacerbated by the debt-servicing burden, which has become unbearable. This is the heritage bequeathed to us by one-party management - an economy bled dry. Thus it has been decided to assign to the transition Government the task of drawing up and implementing  programme of stabilization and economic recovery, within which an improvement in public finance and a restructuring of the economy and of the banking system are priority objectives.\nThe implementation of the reforms that have been advocated, whose social cost can already be measured, calls for commitment on our part, and their application calls for perseverance. However, in an international economic environment tilting towards depression, and, above all, without external support, particularly the support of the international community, our efforts alone cannot bear the fruits that we hope for. It should be stressed that the political liberalization that is under way in my country quite naturally calls for the adoption of a similar policy of economic liberalization. The Government of Transition and National Unity of the Congo intends to revive private initiative through incentive Measures, such as the adoption of a new code of investment to promote the development of the private sector at the national and international levels, as well as foreign investment. Indeed, we have chosen liberalisation and privatisation as elements in the process of re-launching our economy - notably through private investment, to the advantage of small and medium-sized industries, agriculture, trade and crafts.\nConcern in Africa is merely a reflection of the economic and social crisis affecting all developing countries. The scope of indebtedness, which has become stifling, continues to hamper all efforts at economic recovery, and these are further inhibited by net negative financial flows. So far as the African countries are concerned, the holding of an international conference on African external debt deserves greater interest on the part of the international community. Moreover, my country is very concerned about the persistence of the combined effects of the deterioration in terms of trade and the constant fall in export earnings caused by unprecedented fluctuations in the prices of commodities on which the African economies in particular depend. This is why we are placing all our hopes in a rapid and favourable outcome to the negotiations of the Uruguay Round with a view to achieving an open, multinational trade system that is more just and more equitable.\nFrom the viewpoint of interdependence, I am convinced that we should envisage a solution to this crisis, which is raging in most of the developing countries. The General Assembly's Declaration on International Economic Cooperation - in particular on the recovery of growth and development in developing countries, together with the International Development Strategy -\noffers, in this respect, an ideal framework for cooperation. Moreover, South-South cooperation - an indispensable complement - should decisively direct developing countries towards collective autonomy aimed at reducing the marginalization of their economies, which is perpetuated by an unfair world economic order. The establishment of an African common market meets this concern and is also a necessity, for it is certain that the coming decades will mark a new era of cooperation based on relations between the great subregional economic groups.\nThe position that the question of the environment now occupies on the international agenda is an expression of the international community's growing awareness of the risks resulting from degradation of our natural surroundings. Today there is agreement that the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming and climate changes are disasters. Likewise, deforestation, the erosion of arable land, pollution of water and of the atmosphere and impoverishment of flora and fauna are helping to disrupt the balance of ecosystems. In this respect, management of the environment remains a priority question demanding that States act and cooperate closely. Our economic policies must ensure long-term management of the resources of our planet and safeguard the interests of present and future generations.\nPlacing great hopes in strengthened multilateral action, and taking into account the interdependence between environment and development and the integration of ecological considerations into national economic programmes and policies, the Congo has provided itself with an additional law on the environment - Ho. 03/91 of 23 April 1991 - which proposes that the requirements for development and for the protection of the environment be reconciled. It envisages the establishment of a fund for the protection and preservation of fauna and flora and of marine and river resources against installations that are dangerous and constitute a health hazard, and for management and development of urbanism.\nWe hope that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is to take place in Brazil in June 1992, will be a major event and will make the future of mankind more secure. He hope that the outcome will be favourable and that the Conference will make it possible for us to establish real development contracts - and not simply through assistance - between North and South, so that the ecological balance of the planet may be preserved.\nMy country is pleased at the positive political changes in South Africa, where the legal foundations of apartheid have finally been abolished. The repeal of these legal pillars of apartheid, together with the other measures that have followed, seems, finally, to have involved this country in an irreversible process. However, it would be premature to ease international pressure so long as no real qualitative change has been secured and so long as a non-racial, united and democratic society has not been established.\nAs for the Middle East, my country is convinced that the situation in this sensitive region of the world requires a comprehensive settlement. Thus we attach particular importance to the inclusion of the Palestinians in any process aimed at establishing a lasting peace between Israelis and Arabs. That is why my country supports the idea - initiated by the United States Government - of a conference on peace in the Middle East. We invite the international community to work along these lines in order that a definitive settlement of this question may be achieved.\nAs regards arms control and disarmament, the Congo welcomed with profound satisfaction the progress made with the signing, in November last year, of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the signing, in July this year, of the Soviet-American agreement on the reduction, by 30 per cent, of strategic arsenals. We hope that this tangible progress will be substantially expanded, with a view to Maintaining and strengthening global agreements relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, missiles and other armaments.\nWe should like to express our pleasure at the measures in this context announced recently by the President of the United States. These measures have met with a favourable response throughout the world, particularly among the great nuclear Powers, and thus the trend towards halting the arms race - a symbol of the cold war - has been strengthened. We feel that the time has come to use the peace dividends for development. However, we must see to it that the progress that has been achieved does not promote the expansion of trade in other kinds of weapons, which create misfortune for countries in the third world.\nThe United Nations is now confirmed as the universal instrument of peace and International cooperation. Me assess that universal dimension not only in terms of the increased number of Member States but also in terms of the vitality and effectiveness with which it defends the values, principles and purposes it is universally recognised as holding. But the Organisation must adapt to the rapid changes that are transforming the world so as to meet the challenges of the final decade of the twentieth century as we turn to those of the next millennium.\nThe restored climate of peace and dialogue undoubtedly inspires hope about the future of international relations. Let us hope that this new era, devoted to world peace, will first and foremost engender conditions favouring sound, fraternal international cooperation based on mutual assistance and solidarity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAustria takes great pleasure in welcoming seven new Members to the United Nations. Estonia. Latvia and Lithuania displayed admirable courage and persistence over more than half a century and were finally able to recover their independence. We also hope that the joint admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to the United Nations - something we had supported for several years - will facilitate the unification process. Similarly, the admission of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia has brought us closer to the ultimate goal of attaining true universality of membership in the United Nations.\nWe seldom have an opportunity such as the one we have today of witnessing profound changer all over the world. We all still have fresh in our minds the historic events that occurred in Moscow, resulting in what we hope will be a decisive victory of democracy, human rights and pluralism over dictatorship and totalitarianism. The breakdown of totalitarian ideologies offers vast opportunities for shaping a new universal consensus on international cooperation and peace. We are entering a new era in international relations. At the same time, we must respond to new challenges while the world is still bedevilled by old, chronic problems.\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms have now been generally accepted as central principles for the future institutional evolution of the society of nations. In many societies, we can observe a basic reorientation towards broad participation by the people in decision-making processes, towards a free eco-social market economy and towards democracy and political freedom.\nWithin the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the principle has been established that interest shown in the safeguarding of human. rights and fundamental freedoms cannot be rejected as interference in the internal affairs of another country. Austria has always vigorously supported this position. We shall endeavour to have this principle applied on a universal level as well.\nViolations of human rights, wherever they occur, cannot be tolerated. The United Nations should have the possibility to react quickly to serious human rights abuses and to prevent any escalation of such abuses. I propose that the Commission on Human Rights adopt an emergency procedure based on a permanent register of experts - who could be called \\\"white helmets\\\" - at the Commission's disposition.\nSuch an international emergency procedure could contain the following elemental Upon the receipt of information on gross, massive human rights violations, the Bureau of the Commission on Human Rights would send a team of \\\"white helmets\\\" into the country in question as quickly as possible, which would be asked to examine the situation rapidly. The team of \\\"white helmets\\\" would submit a report to the Bureau of the Commission together with conclusions and recommendations, in order to initiate speedy action on the basis of existing mechanisms. Finally, the report of the \\\"white helmets\\\" and the comments of the Government concerned would be inscribed on the agenda of the next session of the Commission, which would decide on follow-up measures.\nI feel encouraged to make this proposal by the very important address delivered by the Secretary-General at the University of Bordeaux earlier this year. There, as well as in his annual report to the General Assembly, Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar referred to a shift in public attitudes owing to heightened international interest in universalizing a human rights regime.\nThe question of human rights and fundamental freedoms has become essentially international; it is of fundamental importance for the community of nations. Respect for human rights must be one of the pillars of the international order. Therefore, concerns over human rights violations and inquiries with a view to safeguarding these rights cannot be considered interference in the internal affairs of a State. On the contrary, expressing concern in the area of human rights constitutes an important and legitimate element of international dialogue.\nArticle 1 (3), in conjunction with Article* 55 and 56 of the Charter not only permit* but obliges the United Nations to monitor respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in all parts of the world. The practice of the United Nations to intervene in the case of serious human rights violations as they occur In many countries corroborates that view.\nThe Security Council, in an unprecedented resolution, has thus described the repression of the civilian population in Iraq as a threat to international peace and security. This decision is in my view a milestone in the history of our Organisation. It will set an important precedent for our future work.\nMajor progress has been achieved during the past 12 months with regard to making our global system of collective security more effective. Austria has actively cooperated with the international community in promptly implementing the Security Council's decisions with regard to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In this context, Austria allowed coalition forces to fly over and transit through Austrian territory.\nThe liberation of the individual now under way in Central and Eastern Europe is accompanied by the rising quest for national identity. Liberation from an oppressive system must not, however, be followed by renewed subjugation to the destructive forces of nationalism and ethnic hatred. He deeply deplore the bloodshed, human suffering and destruction caused by the fighting over the past months in Yugoslavia, especially in Slovenia and Croatia where the peoples have pronounced themselves in a democratic vote in favour of independence. He demand that the escalating spiral of violence, which may also be reaching Bosnia-Herzegovina, be stopped without further delay. The initiatives of the European Community, which has taken the lead to contain the crisis, have our full support. Ultimately, however, the entire international community shares in the responsibility to bring the armed conflict in Yugoslavia to an end.\nIn the years 1987 to 1989, Austria, together with the other members of the European Free Trade Association, supported the Yugoslav efforts to reform their economy, which was to be the fundamental basis for a democratic State. Regrettably this process of democratisation has unfolded at uneven speed. Its advancement was speedier in the various republics than it was at the federal level, where it was not possible to hold democratic elections. Thus, already in early 1991, Mr. Jovic, then Chairman of the Yugoslav Presidency, had to state that the constitutional organs of Yugoslavia were no longer functioning.\nThe balance sheet of the current tragedy in Yugoslavia amounts to 220,000 refugees; numerous towns and villages have been destroyed) the aggression by Serbian irregulars in collusion with the federal army has caused untold suffering to the civilian population in Croatia. The army is no longer under the political control of the Government, as was stated by Mr. Markovic, Prime Minister of the federal Government.\nFaced with this intolerable situation the current Chairman of the Presidency, Mr. Stipe Mesic, felt obliged to turn to the President of the United Nations Security Council asking for the intervention of the world Organisation.\nThis state of affairs led us to conclude that this situation constitutes a threat to international peace and security. On 19 September 1991 Austria therefore brought the matter before the Security Council. The unanimous adoption of resolution 713 (1991) confirms once again, after the Gulf conflict, the capacity of the Security Council to act quickly in the case of a grave international crisis. The supreme organ of collective security decided to impose an embargo on all arms shipments to Yugoslavia. It also issued an urgent appeal to all parties to the conflict to observe the cease-fire. This strict observance of the cease-fire is essential since it makes it possible for the European regional mechanisms to continue their efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Thus the Security Council has also indicated that its action cannot relieve the European regional organisations of their responsibility.\nThe swiftness and determination with which the Security Council took its decision in this matter confirm that the Austrian initiative to bring the heart-rending crisis of Yugoslavia before the world organ of collective security was well-founded.\nWe are convinced that the future coexistence of the peoples of Yugoslavia will have to be based on the following principles! absolute priority for strict compliance with the obligation regarding the non-use of force; realisation of the right to self-determination in line with the desires expressed by the Yugoslav peoples; renunciation of any change by force of borders between the Yugoslav republics; full and integral application of the obligations contained in the Paris Charter for a Hew Europe concerning pluralism and democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights; and binding agreements concerning protection for all minorities and effective guarantees for the equal participation of all sectors of the population in the political process.\nAustria supports the efforts to launch the peace process in the Middle East and especially welcomes the announcement made by the Presidents of the United States and the Soviet Union that they intend to convene a peace conference in the coming month. At this stage, where there are still important obstacles, we must redouble our efforts to overcome them. We deem it vitally important to develop a positive dynamism towards peace. For this reason we appeal to all parties concerned to become part of this process and to show a maximum amount of flexibility and responsibility.\nWe are perfectly aware that such a conference would constitute only the first step on the way to a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In our view, in addition to the core issues of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question, a lasting solution would have to include the following elements: a discussion of all problems in the region in a broadly based political dialogue; efforts towards arms control and disarmament in the field of conventional arms, as well as the elimination of weapons of mass destruction; endeavours to control and reduce international arms exports; and renewed efforts to revive the dialogue between the European and Islamic worlds. \nI should like to turn now to our relations with our neighbour Italy, and specifically to the application of the Agreement between our two countries signed on 5 September 1946 in Paris, concerning the protection of the German-speaking minority in South Tyrol. On the basis of resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) adopted by the General Assembly at its fifteenth and sixteenth sessions, Austria and Italy agreed in 1969 to adopt a new autonomy status for South Tyrol. The two countries agreed upon 137 measures to be taken in favour of the minority, of which three essential measures still await implementation, furthermore, agreed solutions remain to be found to several basic claims that originated after 1969, and that, in view of internal developments which occurred in Italy, have an impact upon the effectiveness of the 1946 Agreement.\nOver the last years, I was able to inform this Assembly that Italy had given proof of an increasing understanding of the aspirations of the South Tyrolean minority. During the last months, however, very little substantial progress towards bringing this controversy to a formal end was made.\nThere are many voices in Europe today calling for self-determination and increased regional autonomy. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to implement those last measures which I have just mentioned and which have been so often promised. If we take into consideration the profound changes that have occurred elsewhere in Europe, it should be possible, on the basis of the mutual confidence between Italy and Austria, which has grown stronger over the years, to create autonomy for South Tyrol and to secure it against any unilateral modification. Austria would then finally be able to certify to the United Nations that the controversy dealt with in the aforementioned resolutions has been resolved. This model for the protection of an ethnic group could serve as an inspiration for the settlement of similar problems, as has just been mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Mr. Gianni de Michelis.\nThe new atmosphere of cooperation which we are witnessing in international relations, especially in East-West relations, offers additional opportunities for multilateral disarmament negotiations. Me have welcomed the initiatives taken this year in the field of chemical weapons. The unconditional renouncement of any use of chemical weapons upon entry into force of the chemical weapons convention will represent an important step towards the global abolition of this category of weapons. Austria has intensified its efforts with a view of contributing to the conclusion of the negotiations in Geneva by the middle of next year. In this context, I should like to reiterate that Austria would be pleased to be host to the organisation on the prohibition of chemical weapons. Conventional disarmament efforts will be globally effective only if the resulting excess stocks of conventional weapons do not enter the international market. Austria supports, therefore, the initiative taken by member States of the European Community to establish within the United Nations a register of conventional arms transfers, Austria stresses the non-discriminatory character of such registers. By contributing to confidence-building, such a register would also make for greater transparency in the international arms trade.\nThe concept of security has long transcended the narrow definitions of military security. Economic, social and environmental factors play an increasingly important role.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development is of eminent importance in this context. The acceptance of environmental considerations not only as a constraint but as a central objective of development will have a profound impact on our economies, energy use systems and economic relationships. It will, therefore, be helpful to concentrate on concrete proposals in the preparation of this conference. I am thinking, for instance, of our proposal made during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly to send \\\"Green Helmets\\\" to intervene under a system of dispute prevention and settlement concerning the environment.\nWe understand the appeal of \\\"returning to San Francisco\\\" as an invitation to look store creatively at the basic provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe Secretariat plays an important catalytic role as the very soul and spirit of the world Organisation. I wish to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, who has most skilfully steered the United Nations to a central position in the community of nations.\nThe General Assembly would need a better scheduling and organization of its work, a reduction of its agenda and an improved institutional response to the growing need for the intersectoral and interdisciplinary analysis of issues. We highly appreciate President de Marco's initiatives in this respect and hope that they will be followed up. The Economic and Social Council has been the subject of reform efforts for a long time. Important improvements have been achieved. New opportunities may offer themselves for considering and monitoring the issue of \\\"environment\\\" and \\\"development\\\". Imaginative thinking and constructive policy will be required in the context of the Rio Conference.\nIn view of the challenge that man-made and natural disasters constitute to mankind, it is essential that the United Rations machinery be made store responsive to these needs. Austria is reviewing its own national structures in order to provide more effective support to United Nations operations.\nAustria welcomes the enhanced role the United Nations has recently assumed in the area of social development, crime prevention and, above all, international drug control. Drug problems in particular afflict all members of the international community and all classes of society. Comprehensive and determined measures are required to combat this curse of modern society.\nIn order to facilitate a further extension of the United Nations activities in Vienna, Austria has decided to construct at its own expense additional office space in the Vienna International Centre for the use of the United Nations.\nIn conclusion, I should like to offer my congratulations and very best wishes to you, Mr. President. I am certain that under your able leadership the Assembly will accomplish its important deliberations most efficiently.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset I should like to congratulate Ambassador Samir Shihabi on his election to preside over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that under his leadership we shall address the items on our agenda successfully.\nI should also like to express the gratitude of the Government of Mexico to Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar for the way in which he has conducted the affairs of our Organisation since he took office. Over the past 10 years, the international community has undergone a radical transformation. From a situation of bipolar tension we have entered a period of dialogue and cooperation. Under his leadership, the Secretary-General has contributed significantly to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in this new stage.\nWe welcome the seven new Member States. The entry of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea constitutes an important step towards the full attainment of the universality of the United Nations. We congratulate the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, whose membership constitutes a renewed expression of the right of self-determination of peoples. We also welcome the admission of the States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.\nThe current session is being held under the sign c* change. Transformations within States are having repercussions on the nature of world relations and on the very structure of the international system. The United Nations today reflects the new political map, and this is a factor which contributes to its dynamic change.\nIn a rapidly changing world, past political and Ideological frames of reference are no longer valid. However, the principles of objectivity of the United Nations do retain their full validity: today, we have an opportunity to achieve the objectives promulgated in San Francisco almost half a century ago. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there are serious dangers of instability looming on the horizon: we are witnessing the breakdown of the political and military order in eastern and central European countries. Added to popular demands for new democratic institutions and practices, we see nationalistic aspirations that are reviving conflicts long thought to have been overcome.\nThe arms race and the irrational use of scarce resources that should be channelled to the task of development still persist. Although regional conflicts have been freed from, the bipolar struggle, their solution demands that options be put forward which are based on local realities. These are challenges that the United Nations must face at this time.\nChange in the economic sphere has also been intense. We have moved forward towards trade integration, expanded markets and enhanced productivity; nevertheless, there is still a real danger that the new trade groups will be closed to the outside and will revive protectionist tendencies, hindering real expansion in international trade. Those of us who are participating in arrangements of this nature, in common or free markets, must shoulder the commitment to remain open to trade with other regions. This is Mexico's firm position.\nDisparities between North and South are becoming increasingly evident. Faced with the risk that the gap between development and poverty may widen even further, it is indispensable for the trend towards the concentration of growth and technical development in just one small group of countries to be reversed. If the deepening economic asymmetry between nations is not corrected, its effect will be to create greater Instability for all countries.\nFor Mexico today, the exercise of sovereignty demands a greater participation in an increasingly interdependent world. Only in this way will we be able to bolster the course we project for our nation and accomplish the objectives of development and prosperity we have set for ourselves. Mexico is determined to contribute, decisively, to determining the shape of the changes that are transforming the globe. For this reason, we are open to all facets of diverse and complex international life. For this reason, Mexico is promoting new forms of political understanding, economic cooperation and multilateral collaboration. For this reason, it favours concerted action and negotiated solutions to conflicts. Mexico's support for multilateral organisations is part and parcel of its active and diversified foreign policy: it is active because it espouses all initiatives that foster understanding between nations; it is diversified because its efforts are focused on more than one geographical area or organisation.\nOn the basis of its foreign policy principles and of precise objectives attuned to the times, Mexico has forged political and economic links with all regions of the world. It has thus expanded its commercial ties with a variety of countries in the Americas, Asia and Europe while at the same time participating in regional and subregional concerted action. In Latin America, Mexico has promoted significant efforts to define common positions on issues of major interest for the region; initiatives such as the Group of Three, in which we participate along with Colombia and Venezuela, and the Rio Group have enabled us to establish cooperation programmes with neighbouring countries and have promoted understanding between us and similar bodies in other regions of the world.\nWithin this context, special reference should be made to the first Ibero-American summit last July, which was attended by the Heads of State and of Government of the 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America and Europe; in Guadalajara, they adopted a resolution to establish an Ibero-American conference to promote cooperation and exchange views on the major challenges of our times. Ibero-America is thus affirming its identity and renewing its will to contribute to shaping a more participatory, more equitable and, in short, a less exclusive global structure.\nMaintaining international peace and security continues to be a fundamental priority of the United Nations. In view of the rapid transformations taking place in the world and the renewed possibilities for negotiation, Mexico reiterates its view that all conflicts can be settled peacefully. In this context, the role of the United Nations in achieving settlements of regional conflicts leading to definitive accords, as in the case of Cyprus, Cambodia and Western Sahara, takes on special importance.\nNearer to Mexico, in Central America, Mexico has taken part in developing negotiation processes aimed at achieving stable and lasting peace. We give our decisive support to the steps taken by the Secretary-General in the peace-making process in El Salvador; we offer him our gratitude for his efforts towards solving these conflicts.\nRecent events in Central America are contributing to a new climate of trust and cooperation. Mexico attaches special importance to the recently-established diplomatic relations between the two sister countries of Belize and Guatemala.\nWe harbour the hope that the initiatives under way in the Middle East will result in a peaceful settlement based on respect for the legitimate rights and interests of the parties Involved and on observance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. The negotiation processes under way provide a model for peace-keeping in the years to come. They are laying the groundwork for a view of international security based on the commitment to avoid military confrontation and its enormous social cost.\nThe new conditions in international politics must be reflected in the disarmament field. The grounds formerly used to justify an unbridled arms race and to foster the indiscriminate proliferation of all types of weapons no longer exist. At the dawning of the twenty-first century, the world community should have a universal system of non-proliferation and reduction of weapons of mass destruction, of the ballistic missiles each side has, and of conventional arsenals. Priority should be given in the United Nations to examining recent initiatives aimed at achieving these objectives.\nMexico reiterates its call for an end to nuclear testing and for control of the transfers of conventional arms and weapons of mass destruction, in so doing, it emphasises its commitment to all measures that encourage progress towards general and complete disarmament.\nAs the East-West confrontation fades away and progress is made towards settling regional conflicts that for so many years were high on our agenda, matters of global importance, surpassing any one State's ability to deal with, are becoming especially relevant. The polarization of wealth and extreme poverty, the promotion of human rights, the protection of the environment, cooperation for development, the eradication of the drugs traffic and the impact of population movements are on all our minds. Some of these issues will be themes of international conferences hold under the auspices of the United Nations during this decade. In dealing with them, the principle of shared responsibility and the strengthening of cooperation based on a comprehensive outlook, with full respect for the sovereignty of States and for non-intervention, should prevail.\nInternational cooperation in the most disparate areas is based on commitments which are freely entered into, and mutually agreed upon, by the Members of the United Nations. This involves legal instruments which are compatible with the basic norms of international law.\nWe cannot agree with the argument that in today's interdependent world it is anachronistic to refer to the legal equality of States or to respect for their sovereign rights. The Government of Mexico is concerned about a dangerous tendency in international forums to promote, on the basis of what are claimed to be universal values, initiatives that undermine principles as fundamental as the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention.\nInternational events following the tragic aftermath of the armed conflict in the Persian Gulf have led to the raising of a central issue going beyond that tendency. There is a danger that, in contradiction to the United Nations Charter, international organisations will, in advancing arguments of humanitarian need, weaken the sovereignty of States. That would set precedents that we could not accept. We urgently need to strike a balance between international cooperation, the responsibility of States and respect for their internal jurisdiction.\nIt is worth noting, in regard to human rights, that problems such as extreme poverty, suffered by at least half the inhabitants of the planet, are overlooked, while new emphasis is being placed on mechanisms to monitor internal political processes, which it is claimed in some quarters should be handled by the United Nations. Mexico strongly reiterates its position that this area is the exclusive jurisdiction of States. Any multilateral assistance in political matters is admissible only at the express request of the Governments concerned. Abandoning this basic precept would be a serious backward step when possibilities are being opened up for a new harmony in international relations, to which Mexico is committed.\nIn parallel with the intense processes of change that have occurred in recent months, a general conviction has emerged that the United Nations needs to be strengthened and revitalized. Mexico is willing to participate in a process of reforms that contributes to improving the efficiency of our Organisation and enabling it to measure up to the new international situation. It will not be an easy task. The opportunity that we have today to strengthen the United Nations could be wasted if we are not clear about the objectives to be pursued and about the most suitable ways of dealing with the priority items on the multilateral agenda.\nA great deal of thought must be given to the areas opening up for the United Nations. Its organs - and particularly the Security Council - have great potential for action. This has made it possible for negotiated solutions to be found for some regional conflicts. However, there is a grave risk that such concerted action will in time conceal unilateral initiatives.\nOne of the objectives of reform of the United Nations should be to preserve the balance between its various organs. The Security Council, the General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, the Secretariat and the Economic and Social Council should give each other mutual support in advancing towards the common objectives: the preservation of international peace and security and the promotion of economic and social development.\nThe United Nations has become more relevant as the central element in ordering and guiding international relations. It faces the challenge of creating just and equitable ties between nations, through the democratic participation of its Members.\nIntimately related to what I have just said is our concern that a reform process could promote some topics to the detriment of others. It would be a mistake to suppose that the Organisation should concentrate on the so-called new issues or emergency problems and neglect issues that have been on the agenda for a number of years and that are also fundamental. The development and codification of international law have been, and should continue to be, a priority of the United Nations.\nWe recognise that encouraging steps have been taken towards global peace. However, world stability will not be guaranteed while the contrast persists between well-being and abject poverty, both within nations and between them. He should devise realistic and pragmatic ways to put the topics of economic development and international cooperation at the top of the multilateral agenda. Democracy and development are intimately linked. He must work on both for the economic and social development of our peoples.\nMexico has demonstrated its loyalty to the cause of the United Nations during the Organisation's 46-year history. We reiterate our commitment to its principles and purposes. There is talk of a new world order. But little has been done to give serious collective thought to the matter, thought from which could emerge the shape of such an order, which can be stable only to the extent that it reconciles the ideas and interests of the whole international community.\nThat is why the current session of the General Assembly is important. It is perhaps the first to give us an opportunity to bring together the many different visions of the future and arrive at proposals outlining the profile of the United Nations of tomorrow. Let us not miss the opportunity we have at this exceptional juncture to carry out our responsibilities.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to extend my congratulations to Mr. Shihabi upon his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. It gives me great pleasure as a close friend of Saudi Arabia to see the world community honour his country through his election to that high office. With his wisdom, experience and skill, I am confident that he will discharge his responsibilities successfully, guiding this Assembly session to a fruitful conclusion.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, who has carried out his task with dedication and innovative seal, contributing towards efforts to revitalize and re-examine the functions of the General Assembly.\nIt is with pleasure that I, on behalf of Malaysia, extend a very warm welcome to His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, President of the Supreme National Council and Head of the Cambodian delegation to the General Assembly. The United Nations, which has long missed the statesmanship and the ebullience of the Prince, will I am sure be happy to welcome the Prince back to the General Assembly. Malaysia is gratified to see at this session of the General Assembly members of the Supreme National Council representing Cambodia offering definite promise of a final solution to the Cambodian issue.\nThis is also an occasion to join in extending felicitations to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea for their historic decision to become Members of the United Nations as separate States. That decision will serve to defuse some of the tension in North-East Asia and, it is hoped, lead to normalisation in their relations. As a friend of both, Malaysia welcomes such developments. May I also welcome as Members of the United Nations the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania, which have deservedly regained their sovereignty. I would also like to offer my felicitations to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Malaysia's Pacific neighbours, who have become Members of the United Nations. Malaysia extends a band of friendship and stands ready to cooperate with them.\nThe world has witnessed in the last two years more revolutionary changes than in the preceding 100 years. Without doubt these changes have opened new and historic opportunities to build a better world, anchored firmly in the rule of law, the sovereignty of nations and a collective commitment to social and economic justice for all. The world is ripe for a new world order but it is hoped that this new world order will not be one that is imposed upon the world by any particular beneficiary of the current revolution. All Members of this august body called the United Motions should participate in shaping the new world order if we are to avoid the return of a new colonial era.\nWhen the United Nations was formed after the Second World War, the allied victors assumed the right to create a world order in which each of the five major Powers could veto anything that did not serve them. But than the five fell out and the East-West conflict divided the world into two antagonistic camps. The cold war that followed not only retarded modern civilisation but converted poor countries into pawns and proxies, devastating their territories and economies with confrontations and wars. That they were not fighting their own battles is clear from the outbreak of peace in every continent as soon as the East-West confrontation ended.\nWith these experiences still fresh in our minds how can we be assured that a new world order formulated by any one country or group of countries will be good for everyone? We are already feeling heavy hands forcing us to do this and not to do that. In East Asia we are told that we may not call ourselves East Asians as Europeans call themselves Europeans and Americans call themselves Americans. We are told that we must call ourselves Pacific people and align ourselves with people who are only partly Pacific, but are more American, Atlantic and European. We may not have an identity that is not permitted, nor may we work together on the basis of that identity. Is this a foretaste of the new world order that we must submit to?\nDemocracy and only democracy is legitimate and permissible now. No one really disputes this. In fact, speaking for Malaysia, we can think of no alternative but democracy in the context of our pluralistic society. We can also affirm that we have no intention of siding with despots or tyrants or those who deny their people their right to democratic government. But is there only one form of democracy or only one high priest to interpret it?\nWe see differences in the practice of democracy even among those who are preaching democracy to us. Can only the preachers have the right to interpret democracy, to practise it as they deem fit, and to force their interpretations on others? Cannot the converts to interpret the details, if not the basics7 If democracy means the right to carry guns, to flaunt homosexuality, to disregard the institution of marriage, to disrupt and damage the well-being of the community in the name of individual rights, to destroy a particular faith, to have privileged institutions which are sacrosanct even if they indulge in lies and instigations which undermine society, the economy and international relations, and the right to permit foreigners to break national laws, then if these are the essential details, cannot the new converts opt to reject them? We the converts will accept the basics but what is the meaning of democracy if we have no right of choice at all or if democracy means that our people are consistently subjected to instability and disruption and economic weaknesses which make us subject to manipulation by the powerful democracies of the world? Hegemony by democratic Powers is no less oppressive than hegemony by totalitarian States.\nDemocracy means majority rule. The minority must have their rights but do these rights include denial of the rights of the majority? Admittedly, the majority may not oppress the minority but if the minority exercise their rights without responsibility, become the agents of foreign democracies and try to weaken their own country so as to make it a client State to certain democratic Powers, must the majority in the name of democracy submit to the minority? \nIf democracy is to be the only acceptable system of government within States, should there not also be democracy among the States of the world? In the United Nations we are equal, but five are more equal than the rest of the 166. Seven countries on their own lay down the laws which affect adversely the economies of others. A few nations on their own have taken it upon themselves to determine the new world order. Powerful trade blocs demand voluntary restraints and impose laws and rules extraterritorially. Clearly, the States of the world are not equal; not in the United Nations, not anywhere. If democracy is such an equitable concept, why must we accept inequality between nations? \nAll these point towards unhealthy and undemocratic relations between nations. Yet equality and freedom are supposed to be the sole guiding principles of this modern civilization. \nWhen the United Nations was formed, in 1945, the victors of the Second World War arrogated to themselves the right to dictate the roles of and the distribution of power between, nations. Many things have happened since then. The victors of 1945 are no longer the dominant players in world affairs. New powerful nations have emerged, while some major Powers have changed structurally; new ideas about rights and wrongs and democracy have crystallised. Are we going to be shackled forever to the results of the Second World War?\nIf international democracy as represented by the United Nations is to be meaningful and effective, there must be an infusion of some of the current ideas and realities. The world needs policing, as the Gulf War demonstrated. But are we to have self-appointed policemen, or are we to have a police force that is beholden to this body, the United Nations?\nPolice action by the United Nations needs to be governed by principles and rules. Laying siege to a castle or a city until the people had to eat rats or starve may have seemed appropriate and acceptable in the olden days. But can our conscience remain clear if a whole nation is starved into submission? Can our conscience be clear if the principal victims are the old and the infirm, pregnant women and newborn children, the young and the innocent?\nWith the advent of modern weapons, should wars be fought or police action taken by destroying the recalcitrant nation totally in order to avoid casualties among our police force, and above all to avoid the demoralizing effect of coffins being brought home? Is it truly possible that everything that is hit by massive bombs and rockets is military in nature? Is the Geneva Convention still relevant in the conduct of war? We condemn chemical warfare, but must we still have nuclear weapons around7 Are the people who possess them concerned about the horrendous effects of these weapons and are they responsible enough not to use them other than as a deterrent? Who determines when a deterrent is needed?\nThe leaders of nuclear nations, the people who will push the nuclear buttons, are not safe, as events in the Soviet Union have amply demonstrated. We cannot even be sure that someone who is irrational might not become a leader and gain access to the button. Accordingly, the existence of any nuclear weapons cannot be justified in the present world.\nThe United Nations, which is playing the role of inspector in Iraq, should extend that role to supervise the destruction of all nuclear weapons everywhere. What is more, it should control the invention and production of other diabolical weapons. Weapons for defence should be solely for defence and their capabilities must be such as to prevent them from being used as weapons of aggression except in a limited way. Research into new weapons by all nations should be reduced and no weapon should be sold by anyone without permits issued by the United Nations. Malaysia has joined efforts with other delegations at this session of the General Assembly to work towards a United Nations arms register that will provide transparency and confidence as a first step towards giving the United Nations comprehensive authority over disarmament.\nWe need weapons only for fighting criminals. If a nation is subjected to an armed uprising, then the United Nations should take part in putting it down. Democratic governments should be brought down only by democratic processes. Anything that goes beyond democratic processes should merit United Nations intervention If it is requested. We cannot preside over the disintegration of nations into ethnic communities, particularly if military action had no role in the initial consolidation of a nation.\nPerhaps it may be asked why a tiny developing nation like Malaysia should be giving advice on how the world should be managed. We should not, except that what the world does, and what some nations or even individuals do, can affect us - and affect us adversely. Today individuals in some developed countries consider it their right to tell us how to rule our country. If we do not heed them, then they consider it their right to destroy our economy, impoverish our people and even overthrow our governments. These people latch on to various causes, such as human rights and the environment, in order to re-impose colonial rule on us. They are helped by the Western media, which also consider it their duty to tell us how to run our country. All these combine to make independence almost meaningless. Our only hope lies in the democratisation of the United Nations, especially as the option to defect to the other side is no longer available to us. We want to remain independent but we also want to conform to international norms as determined not by some non-governmental organizations or the so-called advanced democracies, but by all the nations of the world. If we default, then it is the United Nations and not some Robin Hoods that should chastise us.\nWe are glad that the winds of change have brought about significant developments in South Africa, which we hope will bring about the dismantling of apartheid and the start of negotiations towards a new, democratic and non-racial South Africa. All this would not have been possible without international solidarity, without the United Nations system playing a key role in putting the necessary pressure on Pretoria. Despite these important developments, international solidarity, as manifested in the 1989 United Nations consensus Declaration, must be maintained to meet the still-difficult challenges ahead and ensure a successful conclusion to the process of change in South Africa. Right now priority must be given to putting an end to violence in black townships, reviving the preparatory process for constitutional negotiations involving the Pretoria regime, the African National Congress, Inkatha and others, as well as addressing the problems of social and economic inequalities brought about by decades of apartheid.\n\nWhile the climate of peace and dialogue has benefited many parts of the world, the Middle East remains the most volatile region and the Palestinian people continue to suffer under the cruel and illegal Israeli occupation. The current United States peace initiative has raised the hopes of many nations, including Malaysia, for an active peace process that would lead to a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the establishment of an independent State for the Palestinians. We welcome the initiative and commitment of President Bush and Secretary Baker in undertaking this difficult task and we wish them well.\nThe plight of the Palestinian people touches the heart of every Malaysian. We would like the Palestinian people to be treated fairly and ju5tly. If what they do to protect themselves is considered criminal, then the same deeds committed by the Israelis should be considered equally criminal. Governments which kidnap and kill people should be condemned even more than desperate freedom fighters who are forced to use violence because they can seek justice in no other way. The accelerated build-up of illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied territories is jut act of unwarranted provocation by the Israeli authorities and constitutes a very serious and unacceptable obstacle to the current peace efforts. In our view, Jews in the Soviet Union are better off there, where their entrepreneurial skills could be put to good use to rebuild the economy of that country. \nNext year the nations of the world are expected to meet in Rio de Janeiro to discuss the environment. If we are to meet there, we need to know whether it is going to be a constructive meeting or a finger-pointing, third-world-bashing session. If that conference is to be productive, we shall have to face the facts and deal with than. Unless we accept the truth regarding the sources and the causes of environmental pollution, rising temperatures and ozone depletion we are not going to get anywhere in our efforts to reverse the process. If we go to Rio, let us go there to discuss and agree on a common course of action on the environment and development.\nThe idea that the tropical forests can be saved only by boycotting tropical timber smacks more of economic arm-twisting than of a real desire to save the forests. If selective logging and sustainable management are prevented, and consequently the forests become no longer a source of wealth, the worthless forests may be cleared in order to produce food crops or to provide firewood in poor developing nations.\nOn the other hand, the vast potential for reforestation has hardly been touched. The deserts of California could be converted into a tropical forest, complete with rain-forest flora and fauna, simply by pumping the ground water and planting trees. Instead, the underground water is being used for golf courses and artificial lakes to surround luxury hotels. If we can build sophisticated war-planes at $1 billion apiece, surely we should have the ingenuity and the money to create tropical forests out of deserts. Libya should be congratulated on tapping underground water to irrigate its desert. It is shameful that nations richer and more advanced than Libya have done nothing significant to green the world.\nThe use of chlorofluorocarbons (crca) and fossil fuels is greatest in the richest countries. Is there really a need for CfCs for spraying when a simple rubber bulb can do the same job? Do the countries with huge populations of monster automobiles really need to use them when small cars or efficient public transport systems could us* electricity generated by hydro-power plants?\nWe in the poor countries should like to have some cheap hydro-electric power. True, we should have to sacrifice a few thousand acres of our forests. But we can spare these, for we have millions of acres more. But all manner of campaigns are mounted against our proposals for hydro-electric projects. Mow, of course, the World Bank will be used to deprive poor countries of cheap hydro-electric power - and all this after the rich have developed most of their hydro-electric potential. Can we be blamed if we think this is a ploy to keep us poor?\nIf the United Nations Conference on environment and Development is to be meaningful, let us hear now of the plans of the rich to reduce their own contribution to environmental degradation. If the sole approach is to link aid to poor countries with what they must do environmentally for the well-being of the rich, then the Conference will be a lost opportunity.\nEconomic growth in a poor country cannot depend on the domestic market. To grow, poor countries must have either aid or free access to foreign markets. It would be near-suicidal for poor countries to keep their market for themselves. On the other hand, there is every reason for the rich to keep their markets for themselves.\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was conceived to promote free and equitable world trade. But how can poor individual countries argue their cases in the GATT Rounds when the huge trade blocs monopolise the meetings? Who would listen to the plaintive arguments of a tiny, insignificant third-world country?\nTo be heard, the poor must band together - not to form impoverished trade blocs, but to lend weight to their arguments. And so the East Asia Economic Group was proposed - not as a trade bloc, but as a forum for the nations of East Asia to confer with each other with a view to reaching agreement on a common stand to deal with a common problem caused by the restrictive trade practices of the rich.\nWe are perplexed to find that this objective merely to have a voice in international affairs is being opposed, openly and covertly, by the very country that preaches free trade. It is even more surprising that there should be such opposition when the North American Free Trade Association itself is being formed on the basis of the principle of the right of free association of independent countries. Can it be that what is right and proper for the rich and the powerful is not right and proper for the poor? One is tempted to suspect racist bias behind this stand.\nMalaysia has supported the United Nations at every turn. We believe that the United Nations is the only legitimate instrument for the creation of an equitable world, for protection of the weak and the poor from the pressures of the strong. We welcome the end of the cold war, but we must admit to feeling more naked and vulnerable than ever. There is nowhere to look to except the United Nations. More than ever before, we need a greater role for the United Nations in the affairs of the world.\nWhile we believe that a restructured Security Council has a vital role to play, we should like to see a balanced constitutional relationship, including accountability between the General Assembly, the 8ecurity Council and the Secretariat in order that the United Nations may truly be made the guardian of peace, as suggested in the Secretary-General's report of 6 September 1991. Related to this, the Malaysian delegation has joined others in efforts to deliberate on ways and means of revitalising the organs of the United Nations, including the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.\nThe experience of the Gulf conflict also makes it imperative that the United Nations explore and put into effect all the potential for preventive diplomacy, including a more proactive role on the part of the Secretary-General and expanded peace-keeping operations. Malaysia believes that the time has come for the international community to explore also the potential of the International Court of Justice - the judicial organ of the United Nations - as a means of fostering the resolution of conflict by peaceful means and in accordance with the rule of law.\nThe international community is now at the proverbial crossroads. We truly have a chance to build a better world through consensus and to use the United Nations as the principal forum and vehicle for the achievement of our objectives. We cannot afford to miss this historic opportunity to benefit from the peace dividend resulting from the cessation of the cold war. It must, however, be underlined that a global consensus approach requires tolerance of different ideas and practices inherent in our complex and pluralistic world. There is simply no place for an international order based on hegemony and domination. Let us, then, work together as partners in our common endeavour to build a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, I should like to congratulate you upon your election as President of the Assembly at this session. I am very pleased to see such a distinguished office held by a representative of our close friend, Saudi Arabia. May I also express my appreciation to the outgoing President, Guido de Marco. At the same time, I particularly wish to thank the Secretary Genera] for the excellent work he has done, often under very difficult circumstances.\nBrunei Darussalam would also like to welcome seven new Members of the United Nations: the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\nBrunei Darussalam still maintains what I described here last year as \\\"cautious optimism\\\". However, we have seen a number of problems which demand early solution. We cannot put them off until a later date. They are bound to affect the positive trends which have started to bring about a new order in Europe. Unless we can try to do something about them urgently, they are going to become very grave indeed.\nWe can see that there is already much uncertainty in many parts of the world. The start of a new world order has perhaps helped to remove some of the outward signs of long-term problems; but it has not. yet shown us how to go about dealing with the problems themselves. Their basic causes are still with us. I am very much encouraged by the many positive efforts which have been made to create a peaceful and stable world. Nevertheless, I also think that there is a real need to prevent old problems recurring.\nThe cold war may indeed be over, but we can see that many nations are still very worried about their security. Noted political gains must be balanced against continuing violence, social unrest and grave civil strife in several regions.\nMoreover, three specific global issues present themselves. I refer here firstly to the risk that certain development programmes may lead to great environmental damage. Secondly, I note that the drug menace is presenting a lasting threat to the welfare of the young people who constitute the productive sector of all nations. Finally, I add to these our ever-increasing ability to cause human and material destruction. I am worried most of all by the fact that we do not seem to have found a way to control the development and spread of such technology.\nThese issues represent security problems which are just as dangerous as any act of open hostility. They reflect a disturbing level of uncertainty. Despite positive global changes, they add up to a host of problems which no one country can solve alone. They are all likely to lead to disputes. The only way we can stop these turning into open war, I believe is for us to act in unity. Therefore we need to identify security concerns in a global context. If that can be done, then we must work together to find solutions. I see those two needs as crucial.\nAs I have said, I do not overlook the positive developments we have seen in the post-cold-war period. They have offered signs that it is possible for us to move forward together. I think that the recent announcements made by the Presidents of the United States and the Soviet Union about reducing nuclear arms are most welcome initiatives. So are the encouraging responses given by other nuclear Powers. They indicate that a new process is under way. I believe that it may start to answer the repeated calls for action in this area which have been made by many United Nations Members. \n\nI fun also particularly glad about the way in which the United Nations has become involved in trying to help solve regional conflicts. I am pleased to see us beginning to address global Issues together. However, the final success of the United Nations depends on the attitude of its Member countries and organisations. It is up to all of us to contribute to building up the type of United Nations we want to see. Every Member of this body should take an active part, in helping to define its role. In this way, we can be confident that the United Nations will not see solutions to problems from limited perspectives.\nThe post-cold-war period is a time to call upon Member States to do everything possible to reach a shared understanding on how bilateral and regional problems are to be resolved. It is perhaps our most urgent need. Without it there can be no agreement on what must be done to address the problems of social and economic development; there can also be little common ground when it comes to deciding what we must do to protect the environment.\nOther moves call upon us to recognize that the scope of our current problems demands a broad approach. To this end, we must encourage better understanding, cooperation and interdependence. As the Persian Gulf war has shown, the end of the cold war will not mean the end of regional disputes which affect international peace. More positively, however, it has demonstrated the need to cooperate. It has shown that we are capable of working together towards United Nations goals when a common threat to our global community arises. It has also shown that we can do that even though bilateral and multilateral disputes may continue to disrupt regional peace.\nIn this regard, I think that regional Institutions have a most Important role to play in making aura that regions remain stable. Over the past two years we have been pleased to observe this taking place in Europe, America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.\nIn particular, we welcome recent developments in Cambodia as the parties and countries concerned with the conflict work towards its final comprehensive settlement.\nIn Korea, we believe that the regional framework for International cooperation which has promoted North-South dialogue has been most valuable.\nIn South Africa, we have seen how countries and international organisations finally persuaded the Pretoria regime to set about removing apartheid.\nSimilarly, in the Middle East, the initiatives taken by the United States, together with the actions of the International community and regional institutions, have brought us some renewed hope. We feel that a lasting peace and a just settlement within the terms of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) may ultimately be achieved.\nThere are of course many other areas of pressing concern. I think that countries can contribute much towards improving them through their various regional or international associations. I feel that it is important to recognize that regional dialogue serves to increase the sense of security felt by all parties. It will certainly help to ensure that one nation's security concern does not become another's security threat. In summary, I believe that a situation whereby regional bodies assert increasingly important roles in support of United Nations objectives is a realistic vision. \nToday I have offered some thoughts on problems which are still outstanding security concerns despite a new political climate. In their light I have also stressed that we have already in place some practical means of addressing them. We need to use them. He should accept that common global problems require unified action. He should not have to wait for bilateral or regional differences to be settled before taking such action. Responsible regional organizations can be of great assistance in deciding what form it should take. This situation, however, can only be brought about if nations demonstrate their political will when it comes to supporting international principles.\nIf this is done, a climate of cooperation and negotiation can truly emerge from a common perspective. I contend that the welfare and security of all people are increasingly served by a strong United Rations in which regional organizations play vital supporting roles. I believe that the means I have outlined are available to us. He can indeed create a situation whereby individual Member nations see solutions to problems in terms of collective security. Brunei Darussalam will lend its fullest support to all moves designed to encourage such a process.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI stand before this Assembly with a sense of pride and humility - pride, because I represent a Government freely elected and armed with the mandate of a people revitalized and dignified by the overthrow of an entrenched autocratic regime; humility, because I represent a country comparatively new on the world stage and still beset by the problems of underdevelopment.\nWhat message can I convey to this world body that is relevant to our rapidly changing times and can meaningfully contribute to its goals of peace, justice and development?\nI am emboldened by the consideration that the vast segment of the world's population and a majority of nation-States fall in the same category as Bangladesh. The new world order we all aim at cannot be realised without addressing our problems and reflecting our hopes and aspirations in the global decision-making process.\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to say how happy I am to see Ambassador Samir Shihabi presiding over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, not only because of his known skill and abilities but also because he belongs to a country with which we have the most cordial and fraternal relations. As always, we are indebted to our Secretary-General for his vision and tireless endeavours over a full decade in the cause of peace. We pay him our warmest tributes.\nI should like also to welcome warmly the seven new nations which have been admitted to membership of our Organization. We look forward to working in close cooperation with representatives of both Koreas, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\nTo our mind, the heart of the great experiment we call the United Nations is about or should be about people. Their yearning for peace, respect and dignity, tolerance and  good-neighbourliness, social progress and a better quality of life in larger freedom are the critical ingredients that the founding fathers have incorporated into the Preamble of the United Nations Charter. They form the essence of partnership, of human solidarity and interdependence that gives meaning to the expression of the very first words of the Charter, \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\".\nUnfortunately, this fact and these elements were obscured as the world turned to grapple with the more immediate compulsions of great-Power rivalry: regional conflicts, the division of ideology and the self-destructive arms race they fuelled. The ruling elites in the different countries have taken cover under the doctrines of State sovereignty and domestic jurisdiction to circumscribe the access of individuals to world forums. The perceptions, priorities and aspirations of peoples are more often than not clouded or forgotten.\nThe danger this poses is now all too apparent. Nationalistic, ethnic, communal and cultural rivalries have resurfaced virulently. They have generated powerful centrifugal and other forces that threaten established boundaries and have unleashed bigotry, extremism and violence in many countries and regions. Unprecedented numbers of terrified and vulnerable people in Europe, Asia and Africa have fled across national boundaries driven by oppression, discrimination and civil war. Economic and social deprivation has been a prime mover of discord leading to alienation between and within nations. Poverty and indiscriminate waste have damaged ecosystems world-wide. Drugs and terrorism have invaded all societies. Worst of all are the huge resources that continue to be diverted to means of destruction.\nThese realities are balanced by positive impulses that underscore the real potential of people for the good of the world. It is a time of rare opportunity to ensure that the benefits of human solidarity and cooperation outweigh the negative factors. There is now greater appreciation of - true interdependence. This is not based on any ideal vision of world government but on the practical realization that science and technology have closed the information and communication gap; that the economic forces and markets, especially the mobility of capital business and labour, have bound us irrevocably together.\nThere is a real chance today that common and collective security can be achieved by promoting the unfulfilled promises of the Charter; that nuclear and conventional disarmament can be advanced in all regions with resulting peace dividends; that the military culture and psychosis of comparative insecurity can be contained through reliance on economic strength and social cohesion.\nYet all these advances will remain aspirations unless we start at the beginning - the human condition. There is resurgent awareness that no social or political dispensation can or should endure that does not respect the dignity and worth of the human person, the equal rights of men and women, and nations, large and small. Human rights are no longer a subsidiary theme. It has assumed a dominant position in world affairs. It is no longer trite to say that the rope of our global society is as strong as its weakest strand. The real strength of society, and one that has enlightened human civilization, is the indomitable spirit of the human being.\nIn Bangladesh we have learned one paramount lesson: there is no short-cut to achieving progress, no matter how reliable or generous our friends may be. Whether it relates to achieving freedom from political oppression, vindicating human rights or seeking social and economic emancipation, a country must ultimately depend on itself. There is no substitute for action by peoples themselves. The fabric of self-reliance is thus intimately woven by three critical strands: democracy, development and human beings. The choice of democracy for us was not based on the goodness of the system, which may be debatable, but on the evil of dictatorship which was certain. The previous regime, which seized power illegally, was pre-doomed to isolation and ultimate failure. Without legitimacy its policies became atrophied. Efforts to short-circuit the mandate of the people through bribery or artificial devices proved in-fructuous. Economic and social activities were distorted to reflect the whims of the ruling elite and the preservation of its powers and privileges were exposed. Corruption permeated all levels. Overall deprivation was camouflaged by projects of high visibility. The inevitable result was alienation between the Government and people and marginalization of different segments of society. The absolute poor were distanced beyond the reach of any development.\nBangladesh's experience has been replicated in country after country. The myth that only an authoritarian government can ensure efficiency and take bold and decisive steps has been exploded. It is now plain that without mass participation in decision-making, without transparency, accountability and responsibility, for which democracy stands, economic growth and the core values and priorities of society cannot be effectively realized. The road to democracy for us was a difficult and painstaking process. Yet we have been fortified in this transition by tangible achievements. Uncompromising resistance, mass upsurge and a momentous agreement to restore democracy by all the major opposition parties enabled us to replace an entrenched dictatorship with a neutral care-taker government charged with the sole task of holding democratic elections.\nThe election that was held within the constitutional limit of 90 days was universally acknowledged as an exemplary model of peaceful democratic expression - this despite deep scepticism that a free, fair and peaceful election could be held at all given severe constraints of time, the formulation of acceptable procedures encompassing a vast electorate of 30 million voters and a past history replete with examples of violence, fraud and vote rigging.\nMany believed that the new Government would also seek to accrue power. Yet through consensus, forged among all parties, a historic transfer was effected from the presidential to the parliamentary system of government to curb any such tendency.\nA nation-wide referendum has now endorsed this change. Meanwhile, the Parliament is following through the task of ensuring checks and balances, weeding out bad laws, buttressing the rule of law and unshackling press controls.\nThis prelude to establishing democracy is all the more remarkable in the face of the coalescing crisis faced by the nation. Many believed that the new Government would not be able to handle or even survive the combined impact of the repercussions brought about by the aftermath of the Gulf war and the devastating cyclone disaster of April 1991.\nYet, this too was overcome with drive and determination, spontaneous humanitarian assistance from abroad and the courage and resilience of our people.\nIndeed, the 200 days that the Government has been in power have vindicated our faith in our ability to build upon democracy. It has reinforced our belief that solutions to the problems of democracy call for more democracy. That is true because our people have demonstrated that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people. They remain our real strength tempered and tested by recurrent trial.\nOur own experience has underlined certain basic truths. Without democracy a people's potential for socio-economic progress cannot flower. Equally, without improved standards of living and a vision of the future that can sustain hope, democracy will wither. Human rights become meaningless in the face of constraints of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy. No other right can take precedence over the amelioration of this condition.\nFor Bangladesh, the fight against poverty and steps to unlock growth remain the foremost challenge to shore up democracy. In this task we cannot follow any role model or set prescription. We must beat our own track.\nThe task ahead of us is profound. Poverty, rapid population growth and environmental degradation torment our people and our development prospects. They are superimposed on an economy with a narrow resource base, low productivity and savings, further compounded by lack of capital, technology and skilled manpower. Half the population is trapped below the poverty line and 80 per cent operate in an informal sector with very low levels of monetization. Annual per capita income growth has remained at a static 0.5 per cent over 20 years. These statistics alone highlight the plight of the absolute poor, long by-passed by development. Happily for us, the poor have proved they are an efficient group who provide us with an opportunity to tap their productivity and creative energies. One proof is that, despite these constraints, the spirit of freedom has not withered but instead burned into flame.\nDemocracy has influenced certain key perceptions that have influenced my Government's search for remedial action on the problems of development. We have taken concerted steps to provide a supportive policy environment that allows us to move gradually towards a free market economy. There is a vital recognition that to succeed, governments must spur productivity by intervening less, allow competition to govern prices and to concentrate on quality rather than quantity of investment.\nOur core strategy revolves around human resources development, a concept that combines peoples' participation, poverty alleviation, environmental supportive growth and advancement of human rights and welfare. Its fundamental goal is to bring the deprived and disadvantaged from the periphery to the centre of development.\nIn pursuit of this strategy, we have identified a number of areas for priority action. These include agriculture and small enterprises which generate the largest number of jobs and promote distributive justice; productive use of labour - our most abundant resource; targeting imaginative programmes to reach the poorest, and extend to them the basic social services, and building a physical infrastructure, especially communications. Most important of all is the need to invest in people - particularly to strengthen the rights and role of women.\nOur experience in microcosm bears certain lessons of validity for the larger community of nations. Perhaps the most important is that standards however ideal, cannot always be imposed from above but must evolve indigenously from within each country and its people. Certainly double standards can erode the whole edifice of truth since we should not preach what we ourselves do not follow.\nAs we turn to the great goals of this Organisation, this perception assumes some credibility. Peace with justice demands that each country and its people determine their own destiny without outside interference; that they be free to choose their own governments and follow their own political, social and economic systems. This has been dramatically brought home as Afghanistan and Cambodia move towards resolution of their problems. It is equally true that the right of self-determination of peoples under colonial rule or foreign occupation is an inherent right that cannot long be denied.\nOne look around this Assembly Hall bears out this fact, especially as we focus on Namibia and the newest incumbents of membership in our Organization. One major void remains: that of Palestine.\nThe Gulf war unambiguously demonstrated the unique convergence of action among the world community to reject attempts to usurp or compromise the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of a Member State. It also increased awareness of the danger of using differing standards by allowing Israel to continue its illegal occupation of Arab territories in the Middle East.\nHopes for disarmament have been raised by spectacular cut-backs in nuclear weapons, by the accession of France and China to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), by the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and by the means being used to establish a durable security regime in Europe. The unilateral initiative taken by President Bush for further reduction in nuclear weapons is another vital milestone. Yet the over-kill factor is more than prevalent in both nuclear and conventional weapons and massive resources continue to be diverted to unproductive means of destruction.\nWhile recognition grows that human rights must extend beyond the domestic plane, a universal culture embracing all the basic freedoms, including freedom from fear and want, freedom of expression and of participation and freedom from discrimination of all kinds on a global basis - such as a human rights culture - still has to evolve uniformly.\nIn South Africa, despite momentous changes, the struggle continues to dismantle the edifice of apartheid and to pursue negotiations that will result in a new constitution based on the freely expressed will of the people, the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nIn the Middle East, Israel continues unabated its policies to change the economic, social, cultural and demographic situation of the occupied Arab territories, to encourage Jewish immigrants, to expand settlements and pursue a brutal policy of repression against the Palestinian intifadah. These are glaring examples of the infringement of human rights that must be redressed.\nHowever, perhaps the most vital aspect of human rights that has yet to find universal acceptance is recognition that the right to development is the most fundamental right of all. Surely, peace and security cannot be achieved unless conditions are created to remove the root cause of war and conflicts - economic and social deprivation. Certainly, this requires us to eradicate poverty, tackle indebtedness, reverse environmental degradation, fight drug abuse and improve social justice and the quality of life of all peoples on Earth.\nI have already underscored the fact that development is the primary responsibility of each country itself. Yet, this approach can succeed only if it is supplemented by a conducive external environment. There is now widespread awareness of the stagnancy in the development cause and of the recourse to short-term crisis management that has been a sad legacy of the decade of the 1980s. We are encouraged by efforts to reverse this trend, revitalize growth and reduce poverty. There has been a growing convergence of strategies to redress the critical issues of decreased investment, reduction and restructuring of debt, trade promotion and technology transfer. Preferential treatment for the least developed countries must remain a continuing commitment in this regard.\nThe debate as to who is to blame for damage to the ecosystem and for environmental degradation has acquired some intensity. One fact, however, is indisputable: all countries - developed or developing - have a shared interest in finding remedial solutions. The question of burden-sharing must take into account the limited resources available to developing countries. For many of them, the impact of natural disasters linked to environmental degradation is fast becoming a question of survival. The question whether they have already crossed the threshold where depletion of the natural endowment has diminished their capacity to meet future needs is an issue of burning importance. It has underscored the need for a long-term perspective to determine the costs of such depletion. It has also dramatically underlined the fact that improved economic conditions are a sine qua non for improving the environment.\nThe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development looms large as a major event for finding cooperative solutions. Key elements will be practical means and costs of redressing specific environmental concerns; an energy dialogue for more efficient energy use; workable monitoring systems; definition of clear norms and sanctions governing environmental behaviour; and the adoption of conventions on climate and the preservation of biological diversity.\nAnother crucial element needs to be stressed. The development objective must be put in sharper focus than the theme of adjustment, which has long overshadowed it. Structural adjustment measures, though necessary, must be seen in the perspective of their inherent limitations. Not least of these are heavy costs, uncertainties, the long lead time involved and their social and humanitarian impact. The hardships necessarily involved often lead the poorest sectors of society to bear a disproportionate burden.\nIf this world Organization is to succeed and flourish, it will depend as much on the resilience of its Member States and their ability to prosper individually as on their ability to contribute constructively to its great goals and purposes. Positive efforts made by each country cumulatively strengthen the overall mandate of the United Nations. Bangladesh in its own small way has sought to make our contribution a priority commitment of our\nforeign policy. Among the major directions we are pursuing, I would like briefly to underline the following.\nFirst, the quest for a new world order must begin with putting our own house in order. He have thus actively sought to maintain the momentum and credibility of the South-Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and, by promoting its socio-economic mandate, to create a broad-based climate of confidence-building, to reduce tension in the region and to resolve outstanding differences through dialogue and negotiation.\nSecondly, in the world arena we support all measures designed to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to prevent war and resolve conflicts and to extend this capacity in new ways so as to preserve the security of small States and institute a system of global watch to anticipate, contain and prevent tension points.\nWe have purposefully contributed to the Organisation's peace-keeping efforts through the dispatch of military and civilian contingents to police cease-fire lines in the Gulf, help reconstruction efforts in Kuwait and monitor elections in Namibia. We stand ready to assist the United Nations peace process in Western Sahara and Cambodia. Moreover, we fully support strengthening the financial and institutional base of peace-keeping and its growth in imaginative directions, including the concept of preventive diplomacy, particularly in containing the impact not only of man-made, but also of natural, disasters.\nWe have striven through concrete initiatives to participate constructively and with moderation and pragmatism in all socio-economic forums, especially for the purpose of projecting the concerns of the least developed countries. Since the only real protection of small States is the\nrule of law, we have closely followed and actively contributed to the progressive development and codification of international law in such diverse fields as scarce resources, law of the environmental protection, refugees and migrants. Through national legislation, its regional extension and international participation, we have also helped to seek solutions to the global problems of drugs, terrorism and environmental protection. Clearly, our role in and contribution to strengthening multilateralism and the central role of the United Nations in the cooperative management of the world's problems remain an abiding commitment of my country.\nIn conclusion, let me say that we have reached a critical point in the world's struggle for stability and well-being. He are face to face with opportunities rare in history. Technological advances in all fields have strengthened the concept of an interdependent world. There is a new mass consciousness of rights that have led to dramatic breakthroughs in democracy, human rights and recognition of the contribution and participation of the people in decision-making. A climate of cooperation, mutual understanding and universal fraternity has been emerging despite many adverse legacies inherited from the past.\nThe United Nations has reasserted its importance and has tangibly demonstrated its potential for collective action. We must now go with this tide and carry forward the momentum peacefully to resolve regional disputes, promote disarmament, contain adverse global forces and strengthen the rule of law. The pre-eminent challenge remains to upgrade the quality of life of all peoples everywhere as the most potent means of demonstrating our common humanity. There is no doubt that the United Nations remains the only forum where we can meet the challenges of the future by drawing upon our combined solidarity and willingness to confront them together.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe social upheavals that have occurred in the world, whose consequences have for some time been steering international relations in a new direction, have recently been so forceful, rapid and profound that the entire international community is still examining their import, and particularly their impact on the very future of international relations.\nWhile it is true that that phenomenon can be broadly explained by the explosion of the contradictions born of the disappointed hopes and accumulated frustrations of many peoples over many years, it is nevertheless true that we are truly confronting a changing world, a world radically different from the one that determined the equilibrium of forces on which our Organization rests today, a world whose evolution, owing to its momentum, we cannot yet gauge with any precision.\nAnd yet we must try to harmony in the state of the world today with the development, of new international social factors in order to avoid aggravating the imbalance that, multilateralism has not managed to redress.\nThat is the line of thought the delegation of the Central African Republic would like to share with the Assembly, to which I am first, in duty bound to transmit the best wishes of His Excellency General Andre Kolingba, President of the Republic and Head of State, for the success of its work. I am also pleased to extend to Mr. Shihabi the warmest congratulations of the delegation of the Central African Republic on his election to the presidency of this session. His international know-how in this changing world promises a successful outcome for these deliberations, and he can be assured of our complete cooperation.\nThe competence and spirit of compromise with which his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, conducted the work of the last session deserves the appreciation of the delegation of the Central African Republic.\nThe Government of the Central African Republic would also like, as his term draws to a close, to assure our Secretary-General, His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar, of its great gratitude for the determination with which he helped to restore to the United Nations its credibility, prestige and authority, attributes so essential today to the action it is undertaking to ensure that conditions in the world will be in keeping with the principles of the Charter.\nThe admission of new Members to our midst, the highest manifestation of the realization of the aspirations of their peoples, is a striking stage in the efforts made by the Secretary General to endow the Organization with a universal character.\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic is therefore happy to extend its most heartfelt congratulations to the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with which my country enjoys cordial relations of friendship, which we hope will be strengthened by cooperation within the framework of the United Nations.\nThe international nodal realities of today's world demand an even greater affirmation of our will to set for them a course that will be in harmony with the ideals and principles of the Organisation. For where exactly do we stand? The conditions that have led to the advent of this nascent new world order are, to be sure, the result of the dynamism of international relations that has brought about the normalisation of relations between the two super Powers on the basis of the redefinition of the doctrine of collective security upon which they are engaged. We have good reason to be pleased that the outcome has been this positive trend, which has resulted in greater compromise on all international questions, beginning with those relating to international peace and security.\nThe evolution of the situation in those regions of the world that have been a source of concern to the international community is also significant in thin respect. Whether in Cambodia, in Western Sahara, in Afghanistan, in southern Africa or in the Korean peninsula. United Nations action, supported by the real political will of the parties involved, has made it possible to come up with or at least to initiate a solution in line with this trend towards compromise.\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic would also like to see that name spirit define the settlement of questions linked to the rise of nationalism throughout the world, as in Eastern Europe. But the indivisibility of peace must not prevent certain regions whose peoples rightly aspire to a life in peace from benefiting from the current, trends.\nFirst, there is the Middle East, where everything must be done to achieve a just and lasting settlement fully guaranteeing the national rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's legal right to exist. My delegation considers that the possible convening, in the near future, of a conference on peace in the Middle East will provide an opportunity to formulate such a settlement.\nThen there is South Africa, where the Pretoria government's desire to enact reforms has placed the national debate in a new light. We should encourage the continuation of ongoing efforts to transform South Africa into a truly democratic society boasting equal rights and completely rid of apartheid.\nSuch developments, made possible by the new climate in international relations, might have been extended also to other spheres of cooperation needed for balance in a changing world. But that has not happened, as witness the strictly limited cooperation among States in so fundamental an area as development. It is precisely there that we can see the gap between the aspirations of the majority of the world's peoples and the international community's response to those aspirations.\nIn the view of my delegation, that response must be modified by integrating the concept of development with that of security: strictly military security, while long the goal set end pursued by States for political reasons, has now been annulled because of the disappearance of the very underpinnings of the principle - the rivalry between the two blocs.\nDevelopment as a way of providing all the world's peoples with security in all areas ~ security of well-being, ecological security, food security - should provide the ideal framework for the cooperation that is sadly lacking in international relations. It looks as if third-world countries particularly those of Africa - are to remain excluded from development In the face of indifference from the developed countries.\nYet how many meetings, conferences, seminars and colloquiums have been organised everywhere, often with the assistance of the United Nations or other international institutions, to consider and attempt to resolve the situation of those countries? Though the ills have often been defined, it has never been possible to find a cure, and the situation in those countries has deteriorated over the years. Owing to the combined effects of the steady fall of commodity prices, the very heavy debt and debt-service burden, negative net financial flows and the growing protectionism of developed States, those countries will never enjoy the conditions necessary for sustained, lasting economic progress.\nThe recent assessment of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 confirms the limits of international action for African countries. At the same time there is a growing tendency towards the regionalization of economic activities among developed countries, which can only contribute to the marginalization of Africa.\nSo what economic future can we predict, for African countries which had legitimately hoped to be able, at this time of a general decrease in political tension, to use economic interdependence to find solutions to their problems? Like the Governments of other countries, the Government of the Central African Republic has defined, in agreement with international financial institutions, a new framework for development policies, at the cost of well-known sacrifices that should have aroused good will in the international community.\nThe round table held last April in Geneva with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) enabled UNDP to assess the difficulties my Government continues to experience in its efforts to stabilize the economy. I take this opportunity to thank all the participants in that round table who took an interest in the situation of the Central African Republic; we hope they will be able to meet their commitments towards my country.\nMy Government feels that the new trend in international relations should also extend to development; if it does not, the new world order for which the international community so ardently wishes will be in vain.\nThere should be more sustained efforts towards a solution of the problems of the commodity market consistent with the true value of those commodities, especially since African economies depend heavily on this market.\nLikewise, it is imperative to give higher priority to the search for a compromise on the question of debt and debt, servicing in the mutual interest, of creditors and debtors. The delegation of the Central African Republic has always called for an international conference that, could achieve this, and we hope that the present climate in relations among States will help bring this about.\nFor some time there has been a trend inspired by the developed countries towards setting an additional condition for aid or any other form of assistance to African countries: the effectiveness of efforts at democratisation and respect for human rights. Such an approach could have the major drawback of attaching lower priority to the interests of peoples still requiring a contribution by the international community If they are to enjoy Increased well-being.\nCountries such as the Central African Republic, which have already embarked on a confirmed course of democratisation, would like the international community to consider this new context to support the various efforts towards deepening and spreading democracy.\nIt is possible to follow international social trends in order to avoid a discrepancy between world social reality and the law of the United Nations. Cooperation among States, as set out in the Charter, has allowed international relations to move in a new political direction; it must also show States the means to realize those international social realities that reflect the aspirations of the majority of the world's peoples.\nWorld balance demands this, and the delegation of the Central African Republic, which believes in a future according with the purposes of the Charter, wants to join other Members in expressing the hope that this session will mark a new stage on the road towards effective development, cooperation among States.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease accept my sincere congratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, which we see as due recognition of your outstanding professional experience and of the role of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the contemporary world. I hope that relations between our two countries will develop in the best interest of our two peoples and of international cooperation. Allow me to wish you every success and to express my confidence that under your highly competent leadership this session will be a most successful one.\nI would also like to thank Mr. Guido de Marco, the President of the Assembly at its forty-fifth session, for his contribution to the efficient and fruitful work of that session.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express our special gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless and selfless efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and cooperation and at enhancing the role and prestige of the United Nations.\nWe welcome the admission of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to the big family of the United Nations. We believe that the universal nature of this Organisation is one of its greatest virtues and a major precondition for success. We are particularly delighted at the admission of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which is further recognition of the irreversibility of the democratic changes in today's world.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of historic changes, unprecedented in scope and depth, affecting various parts of the globe. Democracy has triumphed over totalitarianism. The decades-old bipolar model of the world that we all knew, a model primarily based on the military and political confrontation between the two systems, has been gradually giving way to a new state of international relations. Free of the icy breath of the cold war, this new state of international relations paves the way for normal communication between peoples from different countries and continents. Ideological rivalry and mutual suspicion are being superseded by understanding and confidence. A growing number of free and sovereign States are pooling together their efforts, seeking solutions to urgent global issues of peace, security, disarmament, economic development, ecology, health care and the elimination of famine, terrorism and drug trafficking.\nToday, all of us, together or individually, are seeking our place in the future, a future whose outlines are becoming increasingly clear. Any strategy, any philosophy can succeed only if and when it is guided by, and based on, universally recognized human democratic values. That is the foundation on which the new world order must be built.\nBut the present period of transition is not entirely free of danger. The world has not completely rid itself of forces which - as happened in Moscow last August - are ready and have the daring to raise a hand against the established constitutional democratic order in one country or another. Those forces cannot understand or accept the collapse of communism. And in many cases the result is that regional, or often even international security, is held hostage to national, ethnic, religious or social conflicts.\nToday's complex international situation requires an adequate response from the world community and the full and efficient utilisation of the experience accumulated over the years by the United Nations, Of particular importance to that end is the establishment of a multilateral approach to politics, which we see in terms of the common aspiration of nations large and small to seek peaceful settlement of disputes, to manifest solidarity in the face of aggression, to reduce and control military arsenals, and to re-channel funds thus released into the quest for solutions to world problems. Humanity will be able to confront the challenges of the future only if it strives for the establishment of a radically new system of global security in all its aspects, for fair and well-balanced trade and economic relations and for strict observance of human rights and liberties and of the inalienable right of all peoples to self-determination.\nIn the aftermath of the Gulf War, a different and surely more complex aspect of international solidarity has emerged: namely, how to provide compensation for those nations that suffered the gravest losses and damage in fulfilling their commitment to the relevant Security Council resolutions, which were the result of the will of the international community. \nAs one of the countries most affected in this respect, Bulgaria underscores the continuing validity of the Security Council decision of 12 December 1990, in relation to Article 50 of the United Nations Charter, as well as of the subsequent appeal (S/PV.2985) by the Council's President. We now look forward to the concrete practical measures that will ultimately come as a result of these decisions, and we are happy that the matter has not been ignored by the Secretary-General in his report (A/46/1) on the work of the Organization.\nThe positive developments in international relations are largely due to the collapse of Communism and to the swift democratic process in the eastern half of Europe. We are now witnessing a unique period in history, when all nations in this continent are joining their efforts in building the future European architecture. With the signing of the Paris Charter, the member States of the Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE) in Europe declared their determination to say goodbye to the legacy of the past and to establish genuine democracy, peace and a united Europe. Within the framework of this forum a system of security and stability has begun to take shape, with mutual confidence and partnership as its basic tenets.\nThe dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty and the ongoing transformation of the political and military strategy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are indeed steps of paramount historic importance. The emphasis is gradually being shifted from military deterrence to political factors and concrete steps towards restructuring and reducing armed forces. The entry into force and implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe will mark another major stage in the transition towards defensive sufficiency in that continent.\nAt the same time, there is an ever-increasing need to make yet another step forward in the near future, aimed at eliminating the destabilizing subregional imbalances in certain parts of the continent. I can assure the Assembly that my country, Bulgaria, is ready to take its share of the common responsibility of European States. It is in that light that we regard the forthcoming admission of Bulgaria to the Council of Europe and the political cooperation which our country has established and has been developing with NATO and the Western European Onion. At the same time, Bulgaria is entitled to have the understanding and support of its partners on the common road towards a united and free Europe, with full regard to the legitimate interests of its security.\nThe Balkans, which are part and parcel of Europe, have also undergone substantial transformations over the past year. Yet I feel duty-bound to note that this region is again charged with tremendous tension. We are particularly alarmed by the situation in Yugoslavia. It is clearly getting out of control. There is an escalation of the fighting and an increasingly real danger of an all-out civil war. The aggravation of the crisis is due to a large extent to the attempts forcibly to redraw borders between the Republics and redistribute territories. There is a danger of the inter-ethnic armed conflicts spreading to borderline areas, or even spilling over into the territories of neighbouring States.\nIn this alarming situation, Bulgaria has been actively supporting the efforts of the CSCE and the European Community in seeking a peaceful settlement to the crisis. However, we are bound to note with concern that the concrete results of these efforts to contribute to an adequate solution have not yet met expectations. Bulgaria is in favour of seeking a solution to the conflict by reasonable dialogue, with strict observance of human rights, the interests of all Republics and the legitimate expression of their will for self-determination and the free choice of form of government. These principles, however, should be implemented by peaceful means, in the language of diplomatic negotiations and political compromise. The revision by force of the existing borders is utterly unacceptable.\nWe believe that a viable cease-fire agreement strictly observed by all factions involved and a clear denunciation of the policy of fait accompli are indispensable for the progress of the negotiations. We support Security Council resolution 713 (1991) for a peaceful solution to the crisis. We stand ready to offer our active support for any initiative, whether launched by the world Organization or on a regional basis, aimed at promoting a political settlement of the crisis in compliance with the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the charter of Paris for a New Europe.\nWith respect to all-Balkan cooperation, Bulgaria highly appreciates this positive development, which it regards as an integral part of the European process. It is also necessary to extend cooperation in the Balkans into the political and military spheres, particularly in matters of confidence-building and security.\nLast year, addressing the General Assembly, the President of Bulgaria, Mr. Zhelyu Zhelev, voiced the determination of the Bulgarian people to break away from the totalitarian past and to become part of the democratic civilized world, building its future on the basis of universally recognized human values and norms. I am now happy to be able to state that we have not veered away from the chosen steep path of transition from a totalitarian towards a democratic civil society, from a centralized economy towards a free-market economy. A multi-party Parliament, the result of the first free and democratic elections in 40 years, held in Bulgaria in June 1990, a constitutionally elected President who himself epitomizes the struggle for democracy, a Government formed by members of the main political forces represented in Parliament - these are the motive forces and guarantees of the irreversible nature of the changes in my country.\nWe consider it our great achievement that we have managed to preserve the internal peace; this very fact is a stabilizing factor on a regional level. I have no doubt that the outcome of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Bulgaria, scheduled to be held on 13 October, will adequately reflect the general trend of change in my country and in Eastern Europe at large, and will further stimulate democracy.\nThe peaceful nature of the democratic process in Bulgaria may not be enough in itself to hold the daily attention of the international community, but there Should be no doubt that the ongoing transition in my country, in its scope and dimensions, is in full harmony with the most radical and irreversible changes in the budding European democracies. Such sweeping reforms have established Bulgaria as a nation with a new face, rapidly moving towards democracy. We have placed in the limelight the imperative necessity to respect, observe and guarantee all the basic human rights and fundamental freedoms - a sine qua non for building Bulgaria as a modern and democratic State where the rule of law is the basic premise.\nProtection against discrimination of any kind and for any reason whatsoever, the abolition of privileges, the guaranteed freedom of expression, the right to share in the governing of the country by participating in fair, democratic and regular elections, freedom of thought and religion, freedom of association and the division of power - those are but a few of the milestones on the road to democracy which form the core of the new Constitution of Bulgaria.\nWe are confident that the standards and norms in the sphere of human rights adopted and upheld by the United Nations nave played an invaluable role in inspiring and encouraging the democratic changes in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and in reforming their national legislations and administrative practices. The radically changed attitude of democratic Bulgaria towards the internationally recognized criteria on human rights has been evidenced in a series of new legislative acts providing sound guarantees for the complete and unconditional observance by my country of its international commitments.\nThese democratic changes have provided favourable conditions for laying the foundations of Bulgaria's new foreign policy, which is sovereign and independent. The principles, objectives and priorities of our foreign policy have been thoroughly revised. Rid of its previous ideological one-sidedness, this new foreign policy is designed to provide the best opportunities for the further development and deepening of the democratic process in my country, for Bulgaria's ever-closer commitment to the established European and world democratic values and structures.\nNaturally, it is the primary objective of Bulgaria's independent foreign policy to seek stronger guarantees for the country's territorial integrity and national security. In this, we shall explore the opportunities we have on a bilateral or regional and international level, as well as the mechanisms provided under the United Nations Charter.\nBulgaria consistently upholds the principle of the rule of law and the ensuing need to build an effective international legal order. The country's new constitution contains provisions explicitly stating the precedence of international treaties in force for Bulgaria over such clauses of its domestic legislation as may be at variance with them.\nThe years we are now going through mark a turning-point in the role of the United Nations in today's world. The entire development of mankind since the devastating Second World War has highlighted the timeless significance of the United Nations ideals as the basis and standard for international relations. We are convinced that, in the present circumstances, the United Nations will continue to consolidate its role as a unique forum of cooperation for harmonizing the interests of nations towards achieving mutually acceptable solutions and broader consensus, promoting freedom, democracy, the rule of law, economic well-being, prosperity and the observance of human rights as paramount requirements for all States. In this context, we deem it appropriate that a thorough revision be made of some outdated views and resolutions of the United Nations bearing the birthmarks of ideological confrontation, notably the notorious General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX). Also irrelevant today are the provisions in the United Nations Charter regarding the so-called enemy States. I am sure that there could, and there should, be a way to eliminate this anachronism.\nA particularly encouraging fact is the growing role of the United Nations in the keeping of international peace and security. After almost five decades, the Organization's activity is getting closer than ever to the original idea of its founders, providing adequate conditions for the efficient functioning of the system of international security which underlies the United Nations Charter. In the new international situation, this means, in practical terms, being ready and able to react to new kinds of destabilizing factors, very different from those characteristic of the recent past. At the same time, opportunities have been created for unbinding that part of its peace-making potential that, until recently, remained bound for ideological or political reasons. Some good cases in point are the resolutions of the Security Council on restoring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and, notably, the exemplary consensus among the Council's five permanent members. In our view, the experience accumulated and the precedents thus set are of substantial importance for further streamlining and harmonizing the action of the respective mechanisms within the system of international security. This is one of the roads for the United Nations to follow in its further development in order to remain and even become a more effective guarantor of international security as well as of the national security of each and every Member State.\nThe course of events over the past year definitely shows that the international community should rely to a greater extent on the potentials of preventive diplomacy. In the future, the United Nations could play an indispensable role in the early identification of crises. The setting up and efficient operation of such mechanisms will no doubt have a considerable general stabilizing effect.\nThe radical changes taking place in the international situation in recent years have made the United nations peace-keeping task considerably easier. The world Organization has done a great deal to ease tension in various hot spots around the globe. We are now witnessing a series of prompt and efficient international actions under United Nations auspices aimed at containing and seeking an effective settlement for a number of international conflicts. There are favourable possibilities and hopes for an early peaceful and just solution to such complex international issues as the Cyprus problem, peace in Cambodia, the situation in Afghanistan, the referendum in Western Sahara and so on. We are following, with keen interest, the changing situation in the Republic of South Africa, where a series of legislative steps were made that merit due respect and inspire hope for a radical constitutional reform in the near future, having as its aim the ultimate and complete abolition of the system of apartheid. We are also optimistic about the efforts that are being made to seek a lasting and just settlement for the Middle East conflict by all political means available.\nAs for the post-war situation in the Persian Gulf, it is in the best interest of peace and stability that the Iraqi authorities should comply with the respective Security Council resolutions and not create any obstacles for the United Nations teams in the fulfilment of the duties assigned them by the international community.\nThe new challenges in the international situation also pose new requirements for the United Nations functioning as an integral system, presupposing certain structural changes there. The matter should, in our view, be approached in a cautious and flexible manner, bearing fully in mind the interests of all Member States.\nThe international spirit of partnership and cooperation has also borne rich fruit in the sphere of arms control and disarmament. Only the other day, as we were discussing, here in this very Hall, the global problems of mankind, we witnessed the launching of a historic new initiative by President Bush that was welcomed with broad approval and appreciation by the international community - an approval and appreciation to which Bulgaria wholeheartedly subscribes.\nNew Bulgaria is looking towards the possibilities for peace and stability that a pragmatic approach to such problems may bring. We pay due attention to markedly global as well as to purely regional initiatives in this direction, as the prospects for Bulgaria's national security are equally related to both, bearing in mind that we live, and have to live, in a region where global strategic interests and the regional interests of a number of States have long been closely interwoven.\nBulgaria is striving to promote the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other destabilizing military technologies in more than one way: by stepping up its national exports control, as well as by offering assistance in the process of international harmonization of the underlying principles of a responsible arms-export policy, by means, inter alia, of the United Nations register of international arms supplies.\nWe welcome and appreciate the accession of all nuclear-weapons States to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the efforts to bring the negotiations on the convention on the universal ban and elimination of chemical weapons to an early and successful end. Bulgaria is preparing to abide strictly by its commitments under the future convention. \nThe lowering of the general level of confrontation has made it possible to release resources to enable the international community to address the common problems facing the entire world. Conversion of military resources and industries for civilian use in a number of States is already stimulating the growth of their national economies.\nNow more than ever the safeguarding of peace and security depends on the provision of suitable conditions for a steady social and economic development of all countries and regions. The United Nations should, therefore, occupy a befitting place in the process of harmonizing international economic cooperation with the new political realities.\nOne of the major factors for the stable and balanced functioning of the world economy is the establishment and maintenance of a favourable global economic climate. Eliminating the existing imbalances in international financial relations and the setting up of a system of open trade are, without question, priority tasks of paramount significance. It is vitally important that a lasting solution be found to the foreign debt issue. Promoting dialogue between debtors, creditors and international financial institutions with the active cooperation of the United Nations would certainly be helpful in this respect.\nAmong the common problems facing mankind, of particular urgency in recent years is that of protection of the environment. National boundaries are no barrier to polluted and contaminated air or waters, acid rain, the greenhouse effect or nuclear fallout. Only by the joint efforts of the international community could a solution be found to the question of the ecological survival of the planet. We believe that the World Conference on the Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, will develop a universal ecological policy to deal with such matters. \nThe successful transition of the countries in Eastern Europe to a free market economy and their integration into the world economic, trade and financial systems will provide a positive impetus for the world economy in the long term. This process will essentially become one of the main challenges of the 1990s and its successful implementation will largely determine whether there will be economic and political stability in the world.\nThe triumph of the ideas of liberty, democracy and human dignity today is a major source of new hopes for mankind. Whether these hopes will become a reality depends, to a great extent, on the activity of the United Nations, which we are certain will live up to the standards of the upcoming new era of global cooperation. It is the world Organisation that is called upon, and is indeed able, to become the hub and centre for pooling together the efforts of all countries and peoples to build a new, stable and prosperous world. And I should like to assure the Assembly that new, democratic Bulgaria will spare no effort to be a worthy participant in the drive to achieve these noble and lofty goals. As President Bush reminded us the other day: destiny is not a matter of chance, but a matter of choice. I should like to assure you that we in Bulgaria have made our choice and we shall be building our future in harmony with these very ideals of liberty, democracy and human dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first congratulate you, Mr. Vice-President, and, through you, the President, on your appointments to the high offices you hold. He are very confident that throughout the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly you and the President will carry forward our deliberations with the customary good order and good sense, and we wish you well in this task.\nLast year almost of all of us speaking from this rostrum spoke of the dramatic pace of international events. Perhaps we all expected that after those dramas there would be a return to the normal tenor of diplomatic life. But, in fact, during the last 12 months change has continued with a speed and intensity that no one could have foreseen. Some of this change has been beneficial, flowing from the end of the cold war, which we all welcomed. But other changes have reminded us how much hatred and bitterness can still shape the course of our world. This general debate is the right occasion for us to see if we can trace a pattern in all these events and draw the right lessons for the future of our Organisation.\nFirst I would like to add my welcome to the seven new Members of the United Nations, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. The presence of you all will enrich this Organisation. Mistrust between East and Meat kept Korea out of the United Nations for too long now the new approaches in international relations allow you to take the seats which should have been yours long ago.\n\nIt may be rash, but I believe that we are now watching the collapse of the principle of empire. By that, I mean the principle that people can be forced to work together under a central rule in which they do not themselves participate and which has no respect for their rights. In some places the end of this principle of empire is coming slowly. In others its collapse has been sudden. For example we are seeing beyond doubt the disintegration of the last of the great colonial empires of the last century, namely, that put together by the Russian Tsars. That system, which was transformed into a communist empire by Lenin and Stalin, is now smashed for good - and smashed not by its critics or competitors from outside but by the peoples whom it sought to imprison. That old system has gone; a new system is struggling to birth. The new system tries to accommodate the principle of national identity without following that principle into anarchy.\nNationalism is a legitimate expression of a people's aspirations; but we have all learned the hard way that nationalism is not enough. A new flag, an old flag revived, a new capital, a new parliament, new uniforms do not in themselves bring security and happiness. Nationalism can be sterile unless it respects the rights of individuals and minorities. Nationalism can be dangerous unless nation States work together for collective security and collective prosperity.\nSo consent within nations, cooperation between nations, must be the pattern at which we aim.\nThese or similar thoughts must have been in many of our minds as we watched the tragedy of Yugoslavia unfolding. I hope and believe that the Security Council, at its meeting this afternoon, can add its unique authority to the efforts already being made by the European Community and by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) to help those among all the peoples of Yugoslavia who want to see an end to bloodshed and the beginning of a new pattern for their future. I share the emotions and anxieties expressed a few minutes ago here by Hans Dietrich Genscher, on behalf of Germany, and all of us in the European Community will work strenuously, continuously, to help the Yugoslavs find that new pattern for their future.\nWe cannot prescribe or dictate this pattern either for the peoples of the Soviet Union or for the peoples of Yugoslavia. We can show sympathy, understanding and help for the huge task of reform now under way. In the Soviet Union when people are hungry this winter we can help to feed them out of the surpluses of the West and, I hope, of central and eastern Europe. We can provide - we are providing - technical assistance, particularly to help bring the food from the farms to the shops. We can build up our relationships with the Republics of the Soviet Union as they gain in authority. He can continue the friendly pressure for human rights embodied in the Charter of Paris of the CSCE, signed last November. It is not in the interests of the International community that the Soviet Union should entirely disintegrate, leaving no central authority to deal with those matters where central decisions are needed. Dramatic progress has been made over arms control and disarmament. That progress should not be dissipated or put at risk by lack of adequate coherent authority in the Soviet Union. The Republics are making their own arrangements with the centre to influence the course of foreign policy, and we look forward to the outcome. But it would be a pity, from the point of view of the United Nations, if the cooperation which we have recently come to expect from the Soviet Union on, for example, the Middle East, the problems of the Gulf, the problems of Africa, were dissipated just when its usefulness is most apparent.\nI mentioned South Africa. The situation there is entirely different, but there is one common thread. Here too we are watching the disappearance of a regime which was based on suppression and discrimination. No one can now suppose that apartheid can survive or can return. The courage shown by State President De Klerk, Mr. Nelson Mandela and other leaders of the South African people deserves to be recognized and encouraged. Here again, it is not for the outside world to decide on the constitutional pattern of the new South Africa, though I think we are entitled to urge forward those who are now beginning that task. It is for us, and particularly perhaps as far as we are concerned for the members of the Commonwealth at our forthcoming Heads of Government meeting in Harare, to consider how we can give practical help to the new South Africa. No one who studies the statistics of population growth in that country measured against economic production, no one who visits the townships outside Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town can doubt either the need or the urgency of this help if the new South Africa is to make a good start and establish itself as a helpful, supportive neighbour to the other countries of southern Africa.\nAgainst this background, against this pattern, how can we build up the performance of our United Nations? Nothing of course changes the elementary duty of the United Nations to do all it can to protect its Members by checking and reversing aggression. That is fundamental.\nIraq's invasion of Kuwait was an unusually clear example. Now that Iraq is out of Kuwait, the United Nations is insisting - for the first time - that a Member State forgo weapons of mass destruction and pay compensation to its victims. The United Nations is resolved to maintain sanctions until Iraq shows that it is playing a constructive part in regional stability, until Iraq observes the rules of international law. Iraq has to comply with the Security Council resolutions, which are mandatory. If it does not, it must face the consequences, and the consequences of persistent defiance would be grave indeed.\nSo we all share the responsibility to prevent the re-emergence of a danger such as the one we have experienced from Iraq. Everyone accepts that many States depend on arms imports to assure a reasonable level of security and the inherent right of self-defence, which is recognized in our Charter.\nBut the conflict in the Gulf showed how peace can be undermined when a country acquires an arsenal which goes way beyond the needs of self-defence, and in the United Nations have to make sure that that does not happen again. We believe that all States should observe and apply the three principles: transparency, consultation and action.\nAnd that is why, as a significant step towards transparency, Britain has proposed a universal register of arms transfers under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a register would alert the International community to an attempt by a country to build up holdings of conventional weapons beyond a reasonable level. With the support of our partners in the European Community, and others, Britain is sponsoring a draft resolution at this session of the General Assembly which we hope will result in the prompt establishment of such a register.\nThe process of consultations on arms exports is well under way. It has been discussed at many international gatherings in recent months, and we have been encouraged by the willingness of arms exporters, large and small, to exchange information about arms sales which hitherto has been jealously guarded. After that, we have to harmonize as best we can the criteria - the tests - by which each arms exporter judges a possible sale.\nOpenness of this kind will encourage confidence. Confidence allows action. In Europe we agreed on the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) last November. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the START Treaty in July. The main Powers, the main arms suppliers are beginning to reduce the level of their own armaments; they are not simply asking other people to do so. The search for this lower level of armaments is never going to be easy in the real world, and I think we are justified in taking it step by step, provided that one step does in fact follow another. We are justified in being realistic, provided that realism is not an excuse for inaction. The British Government announced yesterday that henceforth we shall adopt a policy of full-scope safeguards as a condition of the supply of significant new nuclear supplies. This means that such goods will not be exported to any country, other than the nuclear-weapon States, where there are any un-safeguarded nuclear installations.\nWe believe there is another lesson which comes from our experiences in the Middle East in the last year. It is the need to handle emergencies better. Tragedy has touched not just the Middle East, but Bangladesh and Africa, and I should like to pay tribute to the international agencies for all the devotion and effort they have put into tackling these tragedies. But we have learned again that coordination, early response, effective delivery are crucial.\nThat is why we are proposing a new and, we hope, more effective structure for handling emergencies and disasters starting with an inventory of human and material resources available from donors and non-governmental organizations. At the apex - at the top of this structure - we would like to see one high-powered official immediately under the Secretary-General. There needs to be prompt decision-making and funding in the critical early weeks of an emergency. Preparation is the key to success and would, under our proposal, be the responsibility of one person. The United Nations is best placed to deal with the human consequences of natural disasters.\nThe United Nations, as has already been stressed, can do more to protect the global environment. Agreement on how we conserve the resources of our planet and use them for sustainable development is equally vital for the future of the world. We have to establish clear priorities soon for what next year's Conference on Environment and Development, in Bio, can achieve.\nThe United Nations can also help with another problem which is looming larger in our world. I refer to the increasing number of migrants around the world. Eighty per cent of refugees are in the third world. Developed countries face an unprecedented growth in the numbers seeking asylum. Some of these are refugees as defined by the United Nations in its 1951 Convention.\nBut most are not. We would not be able to continue to offer political asylum in the present way if the system were overwhelmed by economic migrants. Such migrants can deprive the countries they come from of youth and talent and, as we see in Hong Kong - and begin to see in Western Europe - economic migration above a certain level can also create serious political and social strains in the receiving country.\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a vital role within its sphere and its sphere expands all the time. But the international community as a whole has to be increasingly aware of the fundamental nature of this problem.\nAnd so, resistance to aggression, search for disarmament, relief of suffering: these are all parts of the gigantic and I must say growing tasks laid on the United Nations. The Secretary-General has always laid a particular emphasis on preventive diplomacy, on trying to tackle a dispute or a danger before it explodes into violence and suffering. And we have learned to rely on his combination of skill, firmness and courtesy - a combination which he has made very much his own. El Salvador, Western Sahara, Angola: in all these the United Nations has been active either in seeking to prevent trouble or in steering a problem onto a new track away from the suffering which has already occurred. I welcome in particular, and most recently, the recognition by Guatemala of the independence of the State of Belize. This makes a big contribution to regional stability.\nIt is very good news also that in the last few days the remaining obstacles to a comprehensive political settlement on Cambodia have been overcome. This settlement now needs to be concluded with all speed. The United Nations will remain firmly engaged in carrying out the peace process and this will be an ambitious and, indeed, expensive, unprecedented undertaking. But the price here for Cambodia - for Indochina generally - is very great.\nMay I, on behalf of the country intimately involved in another of these problems - the affairs of Cyprus - wish the Secretary-General particular success in bringing that dispute to an agreed conclusion. He knows he has our full support in trying to persuade those closely concerned first into a negotiation and then into a settlement.\nThrough all these different events, these different problems - and many others I have not mentioned - we can see the same thrust. It is a thrust towards better government, more representative government, better cooperation between nations, greater concern for the individual and his or her rights. No one with any sense of history supposes that this current will run with the same strength and at the same time through all the countries and continents represented here. There will be bastions where authoritarian rule still meets only a faint challenge. There will be cruel and bloody quarrels resurrected from a past which we hoped was dead. There will be setbacks, occasions where hope is stimulated, then delayed or even reversed) and it would be patronizing for any one of us to suppose that there is only one model, only one type of institution which can reflect this trend. There is no Westminster model, no Paris model, no Washington model, certainly no Kremlin model which can be exported unchanged to Africa, Latin America, the Middle East or Asia. We all set about it in different ways.\nIn negotiations inside our European community, we are working hard for an important European step forward before the end of this year along the path of joint action by sovereign States. The peoples of the Soviet Union, as I have mentioned, faced with a quite different set of problems, will be working out their own answers. In Latin America, in Africa and Asia, the same trends are clearly visible. The age of alibis is over. The rhetoric of the 1950s and the 1960s - which as I remember used to echo rather wearily in this Hall - makes no sense any more. Imperialism can no longer, in 1991, be blamed for bad government. The capitalist system can no longer be blamed for lack of prosperity. The evidence, the facts, the experience of the last decade have proved the contrary. I believe that the United Nations, the Commonwealth to which we belong, the regional organizations can all help this realism to expand and deepen.\nHe are talking, are we not, about consent in place of command, freer trade, edging out protectionism, honest government replacing corruption, government based on elections rather than dictatorship, nations cooperating instead of seeking to dominate. These are the aims - clearly stated in our Charter, clearly stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Sometimes they have seemed far out of reach. I believe that, as a result of recent events and currents, they are no longer out of reach and we in Britain, the British Government, will work enthusiastically and energetically within the United Nations to bring them within the grasp of all.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to add my voice to those of the preceding speakers, and on behalf of my country congratulate Mr. Samir Shihabi on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty sixth session. His talent, experience and tact are guarantees of the success of our work.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, who so effectively guided the work of the forty-fifth session.\nSeven new countries have just joined the great United Nations family - the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the federated States of Micronesia and the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. On behalf of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and its President, Joao Bernardo Vieira, and Government, I would like to convey to these new Members and friends our best wishes for success In the United Nations. I assure them of Guinea-Bissau's full cooperation and support.\nWe also wish to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the tireless manner in which he has guided and inspired our Organisation. He has introduced a new spirit and new dynamics into the United Nations system.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time of both uneasiness and hope - while a new international order is being discussed, poverty and destitution persist, in contrast with wealth and abundance. This unfavourable situation to the countries of the third world is characterized by acute structural imbalances.\nOn the one hand the economies of the countries of the North are steadily forging ahead and, on the other, the overwhelming majority of those of the countries of the South are collapsing. The reverse financial and monetary flow and the inequitable distribution of wealth are gradually relegating the poor countries to the sidelines. Indeed, international economic relations continue to be based on injustice and Inequality.\nThe weakest, countries, especially the least, developed among them, are faced with many challenges and are bearing increasingly heavy burdens. In our opinion, there is an urgent need for international economic cooperation to be based on the growing interdependence of our economies.\nThe constant decline in commodity prices, the excessive foreign debt burden of the developing countries, reduced aid and the financial flow towards the developed countries, and the deterioration of the environment - all are challenges to the global economy.\nThe signing by the Heads of State or Government at Abuja of the Treaty setting up the African Economic Community is indeed timely.\nWe in Guinea-Bissau believe that immediate steps should be taken towards a real integration of transport and communications, with a view, in particular, to the marketing and distribution of our products. For this purpose, subregional economic projects as well as technical support institutions must be strengthened.\nWe also believe that our economic partners of the North should endeavour to allow our products greater access to their markets and to improve the impact of measures already taken in this direction.\nMost African countries are obliged to devote a large part of their meagre export, earnings to the Importing of foodstuffs. Guinea Bissau is no exception and food self sufficiency can be attained only if our small economies turn to productive activities such as improved agricultural practices and better marketing, storage and preservation techniques.\nThe burdens of debt and debt servicing are urgent problems that, must be resolved, and appropriate measures must be found to solve them. This may seem to be a problem between debtor and creditor countries but the fact is that a solution depends to a large extent on the political will of the creditor countries.\nWe appreciate the initiatives already taken by some States in this regard, and we wish to express our gratitude for their efforts. Unfortunately, however, we note that the results of these efforts have been insufficient, bringing economic growth and development in the African countries to a standstil1.\nGuinea-Bissau is striving to develop its human resources, for they are vital to economic growth for development. Thus, it is necessary to take into account the related social factors, such as health, education, housing and so on. Along these lines, we urge our partners of the developed world to come to our assistance, with a view to enhancing and developing our human resources.\nOur country is striving to provide its population with good education, adequate health care, literacy training and education for all children of school age. We are counting on international assistance to help us attain these goals, for all such measures also aim at providing greater opportunities for the entire population, above all, women, in education and training in order to improve their economic and social status. In so doing, we should like to assure the international community that we are aware of our responsibility as the primary beneficiary of our own social and economic development. None the less, we wish to make an appeal for greater understanding and sensitivity to our cause in mutually advantageous cooperation with our partners.\nAt this very moment, our National Assembly is in the process of adopting, in a climate of sincere and open dialogue, certain laws which formalize the process towards a multiparty system and the establishment of a pluralist democracy based on human rights and fundamental freedoms. As we see it, democracy means the participation of the people in decision-making concerning the future and sovereignty of the nation. We believe that the democratic pluralism to which we aspire will strengthen our national unity and benefit our country greatly by mobilizing all sectors for development, peace and security.\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau and its people deplore the recent events in Haiti. The government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, elected democratically by direct universal vote and, what is more, in an election held under the auspices of the United Nations, was overthrown by a handful of the military with a thirst for power. Guinea-Bissau vigorously condemns that deplorable act, which is anti-democratic and anti-constitutional, and calls for the immediate restoration of the legal government of Haiti.\n\nFollowing the release of the historic leader of the African National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, the government of Frederick de Klerk has taken steps towards the elimination of apartheid. Nevertheless, we see that the system continues to exist in flagrant violation of human rights. We welcome the attitude of Mr. Nelson Mandela and that of President Frederick de Klerk and encourage then in all their efforts to eradicate the shameful system of apartheid. We urge the De Klerk government to eliminate apartheid and establish a more just, democratic and multiracial society. Guinea-Bissau believes that the universal principle of one person, one vote, must be applied in the elections in South Africa. In other words, the right to direct universal suffrage must be granted to all South Africans.\nGuinea-Bissau is also deeply concerned about the Israeli-Arab conflict, which has now lasted 43 years. My country encourages all initiatives that might be taken with a view to settling that conflict. In fact, since the Gulf War, active diplomacy has been at work with a view to the organization of an international peace conference with the participation of all the parties to the conflict. That diplomacy has afforded new prospects for settlement of the problem.\nThe Middle East is a highly sensitive and unstable region. The cause of this instability is known to us all. With the steady deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories, the daily lot of the Palestinian people is one of bitterness and suffering. He are convinced that the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied since 1967 will lead to a just and lasting solution in compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions - resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Only in that way, we believe, will the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland be respected, together with the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized borders.\nOne year ago, here in this Assembly, we were discussing a flagrant violation of international law and the use and abuse of force in violation of good sense and international norms of behaviour. At that time, Guinea-Bissau  condemned the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. We are deeply gratified today at the complete restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait, a Member of the United Nations family and of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. Now that the crisis is over and that the rule of law has been restored, we appeal to the two fraternal countries to work together to bind the wounds caused by that sad and unfortunate war.\nThat crisis has had negative consequences for my country. Guinea-Bissau, as members are aware, belongs to the category of least developed countries and depends greatly on foreign aid. Because of this situation, we have had to redouble our efforts to meet the basic needs of our social and economic development.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we congratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations on his tireless efforts to find a just and comprehensive solution to the problem. He encourage the Secretary-General and his co-workers to persevere in that direction. He also urge the parties to the conflict to work together to reach a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the problem. The Secretary-General can rely on the complete support and cooperation of my country and of my Government for the implementation of any decision taken in a spirit of harmony and dialogue for the maintenance of the peace and security of the Sahara.\nThe Government and people of Guinea-Bissau support the people of East Timor in its just liberation struggle for self-determination and independence. Or the basis of the mandate given him by the General Assembly of the United Nations, we commend and encourage the efforts made by the Secretary-General for many years to find a just political solution to the problem of East Timor. The people of Guinea-Bissau, which has historic and  cultural ties with the people of East Timor, have witnessed with profound sadness and anguish the domination of our brothers under the unjust occupation of the invader. We are convinced that these abuses, which are known to the international community, must not only be condemned but must also come to an end. \nWe also urge the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to continue on the path of dialogue towards the reunification of the Korean peninsula. For our part, we are encouraged by the progress achieved in the dialogue and negotiation now under way in Cambodia, which should soon be crowned with success. We congratulate the parties involved, and particularly His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, on his courage, self-sacrificing spirit and great wisdom in dealing with the Cambodian question. \nAs for Yugoslavia, we urge the parties to the conflict to display good sense and wisdom, for the good of the Yugoslav population and for the defence of the Yugoslav homeland. We support the initiatives in this respect by Europeans and urge that they press forward with those initiatives.\nThe lack of significant progress on the question of Cyprus in spite of the unceasing, and commendable efforts by the Secretary-General, supported by the international community, is very regrettable. We believe that the withdrawal of all the foreign troops would facilitate understanding among the parties concerned. Respect for the independence and territorial integrity of nations and of States is a sacred principle for the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\nWe welcomed and hailed the signing on 31 May 1991 of the Estoril agreement between the Government of Angola and UNITA. This act, which united all the citizens of that country, will certainly contribute to social progress and viable economic development. We are grateful to all those, near and far, who contributed effectively and positively to the signing of that agreement, in particular Portugal, the United States of America, the Soviet Union and the United Nations.\nWe are certain that our brothers in Mozambique also will find the most appropriate way to speed up the process now under way so that in the near future promising results can be achieved in the negotiations between the various parties for the establishment of peace and security in that country and in the region.\nAs for Liberia, we urge the parties to the conflict to redouble their efforts in order rapidly to find a viable and just solution to the dispute.\nWe welcome the measures taken and the efforts made by the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to resolve the Liberian question and thereby establish an atmosphere of peace, understanding and security in the subregion.\nGuinea-Bissau is a country of peace and therefore its motto is fraternity, agreement and understanding among peoples and nations. That is why disarmament is a moral imperative for Guinea-Bissau and, we believe, for the international community at large, because it is the basis on which international peace, justice and security will be built.\nWe were pleased to learn of the recent disarmament initiatives taken by the two super-Powers. The Government of Guinea-Bissau congratulates these countries and their Governments on their courage and their determination to continue their efforts in this regard.\nWe are convinced that the considerable sums that will be released by arms reduction at the international level should be channelled towards development assistance, education and the struggle against disease, hunger and illiteracy.\nMy country hopes that the efforts by the African States to turn Africa into a denuclearised continent, as called for in the 1964 Cairo Declaration of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), will be given the necessary support by the international community.\nThe current threat to the environment is a phenomenon which must be curbed without delay. The population explosion increases the poverty of the developing countries. The threat to the environment is a danger to the future of mankind. The countries of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel. of which Guinea Bissau is a member, are faced with major natural disasters which jeopardise their socio-economic development. If the environment is to be protected, we must, speed up the development process in the poorest countries because, in our opinion, underdevelopment is a threat to the environment. We feel that protecting the environment also means improving the economic and social conditions of our peoples.\nWe in Guinea-Bissau hope that the new and supplementary financial resources should be substantially increased and then provided to the developing countries, and that the transfer of safe technologies should also be assured on preferential terms. Mutual recrimination will not solve our problems, because we are all in the same boat.\nIt is in this spirit that our delegations must participate together in the Conference on Environment and Development, which will take place in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. We agree with those who believe that the primary task is to harmonize respect for and preservation of the environment with the rational dynamics of development. In our view, the first step in solving this problem of the environment must be to eradicate poverty, misery, hunger and unemployment.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, first of all, please allow me to warmly congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-sixth session. I believe that, with your wisdom and experience, you will accomplish with distinction the noble task entrusted to you by the Assembly. Meanwhile I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to your predecessor, Mr. De Marco, for his positive contribution to the work of the last session.\nSeven new Members have been admitted at the current session to the United Nations. This is a gratifying event. I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the Democratic People\\\"3 Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania on their admission to membership in the United Nations.\nIt. is still fresh in people's memory that the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly was convened under the dark cloud of the ongoing Gulf crisis. As we gather here for the forty-sixth session, this dark cloud has already dispersed. Yet peace, security and development still face grave challenges in various regions and the world as a whole. And the people of all countries are anxious to see the establishment of a new international order which will make our world a better one to live in. Though the past year has seen some relaxation of tension in the international situation, more serious problems of instability and turbulence have emerged, with the sharpening of new conflicts and North-South contradictions. This has caused widespread concern on the part of the international community.\nThe tendency towards reduced tension and stability on the Korean peninsula accords with the aspirations of the Korean people and serves peace and security in Asia and the world at large. The simultaneous admission at the current session of North and South Korea an full Members of the United Nations is an important event conducive to the relaxation of tension on the Korean peninsula. We hope that both North and South Korea will continue to improve their relations through dialogue and consultations, expand their exchanges and cooperation and gradually remove antagonism and estrangement between them, looking towards the final independent and peaceful reunification of the nation.\nThe Cambodian Supreme National Council, under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has held several successful meetings, and, as the organ of supreme power in Cambodia, has sent its delegation to this session. Here we should like to express our warm welcome to the Cambodian delegation headed by Prince Sihanouk, Proceeding from their overall national interest, all the Cambodian parties are working to set aside their past mutual grievances and strengthen their unity and cooperation with a view to attaining soon a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian question on the basis of the United Nations framework document. They are making fruitful efforts to build an independent, peaceful, neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. For over 10 years the international community, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the other participants in the Paris International Conference on Cambodia have all made great efforts to achieve a political settlement of the Cambodian question. We wish to see an early resumption of the Paris conference and the official conclusion of an agreement on a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian question. We believe that a settlement of the Cambodian question will bring about peace and stability in South-East Asia and will create a favourable environment for cooperation between, and the economic development, of, all countries in the region.\nThe situation in southern Africa continues to improve. After 16 years of civil war, the Angolan Government and UNITA have finally signed a peace accord. Following the independence of Namibia, the people of South Africa have also won significant victories in their struggle against apartheid, and progress is being made towards a political settlement of the South African question. We welcome the positive measures taken by the South African Government, and hope that Government, will continue its efforts to remove obstacles to constitutional negotiations and accelerate the process aimed at a political settlement, of the South African question.\nWe are pleased that the question of Western Sahara is moving towards a political solution. China sincerely hopes that, with the concerted efforts of the international community and the parties concerned, a proper resolution will soon be found.\nWe are deeply concerned about the exacerbation of ethnic, racial and religious contradictions in a number of countries, including several in Europe. The national independence and territorial integrity of some countries are under threat, while intense civil strife and political turmoil have caused serious damage to others. We are deeply disturbed by the grave situation confronting Yugoslavia today. We call on the Yugoslav people of different nationalities to solve their differences by peaceful means and to refrain from intensifying the conflict so as to enable their country to re-embark on the road of peaceful development.\nIt is reassuring that, following the Gulf war, the sovereignty, independence and legitimate Government of Kuwait have been restored. However, peace and stability in the Gulf region have not yet materialized, and the Middle East region remains fraught with contradictions. The achievement of peace and stability in the Middle East hinges on the early resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China will join the rest of the international community in a continued effort to advance the Middle East peace process. We have always stood for a political settlement of the Middle East question on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, especially Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) end 338 (1973). The occupied Arab territories should be returned, the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people restored, and the sovereignty and security of all the countries in the Middle East, region, including Israel, respected and guaranteed.\nWe believe that the convening of an international peace conference at an appropriate time under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), would be the best means of achieving a final settlement of the Middle East question.\nPending the achievement of these targets, we support all the efforts of the parties concerned in that region that they deem appropriate and useful with a view to accelerating the Middle East peace process. To help move the peace process forward, we call upon all parties to undertake not to use force and to adopt effective measures to ease tension. The international community should endeavour to help to stop Israel's activities in establishing Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and suppressing the Palestinian inhabitants. Genuine and lasting peace can be achieved only through mutual recognition between the State of Palestine and the State of Israel for the purpose of facilitating the Middle East peace process, as well as peaceful coexistence of the Arab and the Jewish nations.\nThe discrepancies between North and South are aggravated by the widening economic gap and the increasing inequality between rich and poor. Such imbalance in development may lead to a more turbulent world situation. To make matters worse, more than a billion people around the world living in absolute poverty still do not have adequate food and clothing, and many are struggling against starvation and disease just to survive.\nIn the 1990s - the last decade of this century - the people of all countries are confronted with this increasingly acute question: where is our world going, and what kind of new international order should be established?\nThe establishment of a peaceful, stable, just and equitable new international order would accord with the will of the people and meet the needs of the times. It is the view of the Chinese Government that a new international order should conform to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, as well as those principles that have proved practical and are widely accepted by the international community. Facts have proved that five principles - mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual non-aggression; non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence - comprise the most fundamental norms governing international relations. Those principles are in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and reflect the characteristics essential to international relations of a new type. Therefore, we maintain that the new international order that is envisaged should be established on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.\nFor the purpose of exploring with all members of the Assembly the means of establishing a just and equitable new international order, I should like to set out, at this solemn forum, the position and opinions of the Chinese Government on the question of peace and security and on economic and social matters.\nFirst, Having suffered from the scourge of two world wars this century, mankind has come to appreciate and cherish peace all the more deeply. The development of every country and the progress of mankind require a peaceful international environment. In our view, the following points are essential to the maintenance of world peace. All countries should respect each other's sovereignty, treat each other as an equal, put differences aside in the search for common ground, engage in friendly cooperation and live in harmony. No country should seek hegemony or try to manipulate international affairs, or pursue power politics on the basis of the law of the jungle. All States - large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor - should participate in the discussion and settlement of international affairs as equal members of the international community. Every State has the right to choose independently its own social, political and economic systems and its own path of development in the light of its own national conditions. No country - in particular, no big Power - should impose its own ideology, values or mode of development on other countries. All countries should observe the principle of mutual respect, for territorial integrity and the inviolability of national borders, and no country should be allowed to invade or annex the territory of other countries, under whatever pretext, Disputes between States should be settled in a reasonable manner by peaceful means, and the use or threat of force is not permissible in international relations.\nSecondly, an important link in safeguarding the security of all States lies in an end to the arms race and in effective disarmament. This is an important means of easing international tension. All along, China has stood for the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and for the banning of research into, and the development of, new weapons of mass destruction of any type. We are also for the comprehensive and balanced non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through just, reasonable, necessary and appropriate measures. China pursues a policy of not advocating, encouraging or facilitating the development of nuclear weapons by other countries. To facilitate the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and to safeguard international peace, security and stability, China has announced its decision in principle to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In addition, China has always stood for the early conclusion of a convention banning chemical weapons and for greater effectiveness for the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological Weapons.\nNot long ago the United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on the reduction of their strategic nuclear weapons. We welcome this development. Nevertheless, the signing of this treaty is just an initial step in the reduction of the huge strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. Moreover, the treaty does not cover all types of nuclear weapons and does not prohibit continuing United States and Soviet efforts to improve the quality of their weapons and to create new weapons systems. Even after the prescribed reduction under this treaty, the two countries will still possess more than 90 per cent of the world's total nuclear weaponry and remain capable of destroying mankind several times over. The recent changes that occurred in the Soviet Union caused particular concern in the international community as to whether nuclear weapons can be strictly controlled. The United States and the Soviet Union, therefore, still have a long way to go in fulfilling their special responsibilities and obligations with regard to nuclear disarmament.\nIn principle, China is in favour of placing under fair, reasonable and effective control the trade in arms, including various sophisticated weapons. But this has to be decided by the international community through extensive consultations, with all countries on an equal footing, after full preparation.\nWe hold that military capabilities should be used only for the purpose of self-defence and that no country should seek a level of armament in excess of its reasonable defence needs. We support the proposal for a zone free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and comprehensive and balanced arms control in the region through consultations and negotiations with the countries concerned on an equal footing. The views and opinions of the countries in that region should be fully heard and respected, and the possibility of a few countries monopolizing the affair and imposing their views on others should be guarded against. Arms control is only a means, and a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is the objective. Arms control in the Middle East, therefore, should be linked to the Middle East peace process. The United Nations should fully play its due role in this connection and, when necessary, a conference on arms control in the Middle East should be convened with the participation of all the countries concerned.\nOuter space belongs to all mankind; it should be utilized only for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of mankind. No country should develop outer space weapons. The United States and the Soviet Union, first and foremost, should stop developing, testing and deploying such weapons and destroy all space weapons in their possession. The international community should start negotiations at an early date for the conclusion of an international agreement on the complete prohibition of outer space weapons with a view to stopping and preventing the arms race from extending into outer space.\nAn important characteristic of current international economic relations is the aggravation of North-South contradictions and the widening of their economic gap. The majority of the developing countries remain confronted with such difficulties as crushing debt burden, negative net flow of financial resources and worsening terms of trade.\nTo a large extent, the widening economic gap between the North and the South is the result of the existing inequitable and unfair international economic order. The present radical changes in the world situation have created new difficulties for the developing countries. To reverse the situation, it is necessary to establish step by step a new international economic order which should include the following elements:\nEvery country has the right to choose its own social system, economic model and road to development suited to its national conditions;\nEvery country has the right to exercise effective control over its own resources and their exploitation; All countries are entitled to participate in the handling of international economic affairs;\nThe developed countries should respect and accommodate the interests and needs of the developing countries and refrain from attaching political strings to their aid; and\nEfforts should be made to strengthen North-South dialogue and cooperation with a view to necessary adjustment and reform in commodity, trade, funds, debt, monetary, financial and other important fields of international economy.\nThe economy of the world is an interrelated and interdependent whole. While the developing countries need funds and technology from the developed countries, the latter also need the raw materials and markets of the former. In essence, the question of development hinges on North-South relations. Without a fundamental improvement in North-South relations, it will be difficult to ensure world peace and stability, and the situation will benefit neither the poor nor the rich countries. To promote common development, all countries must help each other, like passengers in the same boat, and endeavour to narrow the gap between the North and the South and establish a fair and rational international economic order based on mutual benefit and cooperation.\nThe environment is another outstanding problem facing the international community today. Improving the environment and protecting the Earth have a vital bearing on the very conditions for the survival of mankind.\nThe question of environment does not exist by itself. It is closely linked to economic growth and social development. Owing to historical reasons and economic backwardness, a vast number of developing countries are constrained in their ability to participate effectively in the protection of the global environment. Yet without their participation, there can be no fundamental improvement in the environment. We appeal to the countries with comparatively abundant financial and technological resources to take the lead in moving to protect the global environment and help the developing countries enhance their ability in environmental protection.\nChina attaches great importance to environmental protection, which has become one of its basic state policies. We have taken an active part in international cooperation in this field. Last June, at the invitation of the Chinese Government, the ministers of 41 developing countries met in Beijing for the Ministerial Conference of the Developing Countries on Environment and Development and issued the Beijing Declaration, which sets forth the principled position and basic views of the developing countries on ways to resolve the questions of global environment and development and gives expression to the common will and aspiration of three quarters of mankind for environmental protection and development. This will no doubt exert a positive influence on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development scheduled for 1992 in Brazil and the efforts for a rational solution to the problem of global environment.\nThe promotion of the universal attainment of human rights and fundamental freedoms is inextricably linked to the common interests of mankind. Over the past forty years or more, the international community has made positive contributions in safeguarding the purposes stated in the Charter of the United Nations pertaining to the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Thanks to the concerted efforts of its Member States, the United Nations has formulated nearly 70 international conventions, declarations and instruments on human rights which have played a positive role in promoting United Nations activities in the field of human rights.\nFor a long time, however, the human rights forum of the United Nations has been used by certain countries as a place for waging cold war, with the result that the United Nations efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights are subjected to the influence of abnormal phenomena. For example, human rights has been used as a means of pushing power politics and interfering in affairs that are basically within the jurisdiction of other States; the concept of human rights has been fragmented and double standards have been followed; some have made efforts to glorify themselves and attack others on the question of human rights and set up their own likes and dislikes as criteria of human rights in disregard of the international conventions and the specific conditions of other countries. All this not only runs counter to the purposes and principles of the Charter but also seriously hampers normal international cooperation in the field of human rights and impedes the universal realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThe Chinese Government has consistently supported and respected the principles of protecting human rights contained in the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant international instruments, and has actively participated in a wide range of human rights activities in the United Nations.\nWe believe that in order effectively to guarantee and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms of all mankind, it is necessary to recognize the various countries' different features - their different political economic and social systems and their different historical, religious and cultural backgrounds. In this regard, all countries, based on the principles of respect for each other's sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, should strive to achieve mutual understanding, seek common ground while putting aside differences and replace cold war with normal international cooperation.\nIn our view, racial discrimination, apartheid, colonialism, foreign aggression and occupation are gross violations of human rights that ought to be given full attention and halted by the international community. In the field of human rights equal importance should be attached to civil and political rights, as well as to economic, social, cultural and developmental rights. He must not emphasise some rights while belittling or even denying others. For the vast number of developing countries, the most fundamental human right is the right to subsistence and development.\nAs you all know, China is a developing country with a population of 1.15 billion. In spite of a successful family planning policy, our population still grows by 17 million every year. By feeding 22 per cent of the world's population with only 7 per cent of the world's arable land, China has made its utmost contribution to the protection of mankind's right to subsistence. The Chinese Government has also worked actively to safeguard and guarantee the lawful rights and interests of old and young, women and children and the disabled through legislation and other effective measures, and it has had marked success. Any unprejudiced person can readily see that China today enjoys political stability and economic growth and that its people are living in peace and contentment. China's stability and development are without doubt important factors contributing to peace and stability in Asia and in the world at large. Conversely, should China be plunged into turmoil, stability in Asia and the world would be seriously impaired. China needs stability, and the world needs a stable China.\nChina is advancing along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Over the past 10 years and more we have adhered to the policies of reform and opening to the outside world and have scored noticeable achievements in economic development. At present the Chinese people are implementing their Ten-Year Programme and their Eighth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. We will unswervingly deepen the reform, open the country still wider and gradually establish a new structure of planned commodity economy with a view to quadrupling the 1980 gross national product by the end of this century. In order to reach this target, a great deal of work needs to be accomplished and a huge number of large-scale projects completed. While deepening economic reform, we will also further the policy of opening to the outside world and carry out political restructuring step by step.\nThis past summer some regions of China were hit by severe floods, which brought the people tremendous losses in lives and property as well as in industrial and agricultural production. In some areas the loss was very heavy. The Chinese Government has adopted effective measures, funnelling large amounts of financial and material resources to assisting the disaster-stricken areas and minimizing the losses. In those areas there has been no occurrence of famine or pestilence and no influx of refugees to cities. China has been victorious in its efforts to combat the floods. It is estimated that China's gross national product will continue to grow at a rate of 6 per cent. In fighting the floods and in the subsequent relief operations, we have received sympathy and assistance from the governments and people of other countries, relevant United Nations agencies, international organizations and various quarters of the international community, for which we wish to express our heartfelt thanks.\nWe are happy to note that, as the most important global organization in the present world, the United Nations has in the past year played a major role in maintaining world peace, promoting the political settlement of burning issues, enhancing development in various countries and strengthening international cooperation. Facts have proved that the mechanism of the United nations remains effective. Here. I would like to point out in particular that Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar has for many years made fruitful efforts in this respect.\nIn the present complex and volatile international situation people the world over all hope that, in keeping with the purposes and principles of its Charter, the United Nations will work tirelessly to bring about fair and reasonable solutions to such regional conflicts as the on? Prevailing in the Middle East, promote North-South dialogue and help developing countries overcome their economic difficulties and develop their economies. We sincerely hope that the United Nations will play a positive role in advancing disarmament and in addressing the major problems facing mankind, such as environmental protection and drug control.\nIn this diversified international community, the search for consensus and commonality is not only the original objective set for the United Nations at its inception but also the distinctive feature of this largest international Organization. Faced with the stupendous changes occurring in the current international situation, the international community has come to regard the establishment of a new international order as a common aspiration. We hope and believe that the United Nations will play a significant role in the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international order.\nTwenty years have passed since the restoration of China's lawful seat the United Nations in 1971. Over these years China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has played a positive role in maintaining peace and promoting economic development In the world. In the future, China will, as always, continue to abide strictly by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to perform its duties conscientiously and to join the rest of the States Member of the United Nations in actively supporting the work of the Organisation, contributing its share to the promotion of world peace, security and development as well as to the establishment of a new international order,\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI take great pleasure in congratulating, on behalf of the delegation of Costa Rica, Ambassador Shihabi on his stewardship of this session of the General Assembly. His proven diplomatic experience is a harbinger of success and the highest standards.\nThe Secretary-General's work for international peace and security throughout his prolific career has made him worthy of the recognition of all the nations of the world. In the particular case of Central America, his interest in cooperation in the search for solutions to regional crises has resulted in an invaluable contribution that gives us cause for hope. I pay a public tribute of gratitude and express homage to him for his many endeavours at the head of the Secretariat.\nTwo centuries ago, there was already talk of the need for a State of nations - a civitas gentium - that would grow until it encompassed all the world's nations. In the United Nations we are approaching that ideal, as is demonstrated by the admission to membership of the Republic of Korea, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which we are pleased to welcome here. Their presence is a symbol of the new essence of international relations and of the rapid but profound transformation in the world situation. It is proof that the principle of universality has gone beyond rhetoric to become a tangible reality.\nThose who conceived and founded the United Nations in the dark aftermath of the Second World War dreamed of a world of peace and security in which this Organization would be the temple of right, the temple of the truth, the temple of brotherhood. But for decades the negative impact of a world situation marked by irrationality and confrontation made United Nations action difficult if not impossible.\nRecent developments in the international situation have made spectacular changes in this gloomy picture. Political and ideological blocs are crumbling; democracy and freedom are gaining ground everywhere; and the United Nations is finally playing the role it should always have played.\nCertainly, this opens new horizons for material and spiritual progress for mankind. But this is also a time when reflection is of the essence. The Gulf conflict, with all its tragic consequences, was a painful call to attention, and it must not be ignored. Indeed, as this Assembly meets, violence continues in Yugoslavia and El Salvador; Africa continues to suffer hunger; cholera and drug trafficking continue to be a scourge in Latin America; and flagrant violations of human rights continue in numerous States Members of the United Nations. This is a time not for deception, but for soul-searching. How solid is the new world order that is being built on foundations of peace, security and cooperation? To what extent are we States Members of the United Nations contributing effectively to ensuring that there is no going back? Excessive optimism may well make us ignore the facts and forget what remains to be done as we hail our achievements.\nThe case of Central America is particularly enlightening in that respect. Today there are democratic Governments in all the countries of the region; the war in Nicaragua has ended; and negotiations to resolve the conflicts in El Salvador and Guatemala are achieving tangible results. The process of integration has been strengthened. Panama has become a full partner in Central America's endeavours, and diplomatic relations have recently been established between Guatemala and Belize. For some, the Central American crisis is a closed case.\nWe do not deny that there has been considerable progress, but it is an illusion to think that the regional conflicts ore over. The ongoing situations in Guatemala and El Salvador have roots and consequences that go far beyond their borders. And, as shown by the Secretary-General's important and valuable role in the case of El Salvador, strong backing by the international community is indispensable to a solution of these conflicts. Nor have Nicaragua's problems been resolved by the existence of a freely elected Government; there have been disturbing outbreaks of violence in that sister country, making major support for the strengthening of the country's institutions and democracy imperative. While we Central Americans have assumed the leading role in solving our problems, political and economic support from the international community remains indispensable. It is absurd to claim that the crisis has ended so long as solid peace and stable democracy have not extended to all the countries of the isthmus.\nAs paradoxical as it may seem, our progress towards democracy and peace has had negative repercussions in terms of international cooperation in Central American development efforts. Some may think that the effects of so many years of dictatorship, war and destruction can be erased by political freedom and free elections under international observation. But the opposite is true in Central America, as in Eastern Europe, cooperation from the developed world is decisive if we are to achieve genuine peace and a strengthened democracy. Prosperity and well-being are the best foundations for democracy, and the developed countries know this better than anyone else. In that connection, Costa Rica has great hopes for the efforts of the Association for Democracy and Development in Central America, a body for strengthening democratic institutions in the region and attracting resources to spur the economic revitalization of our countries through the participation. Inter alia, of the members of the Group of 24 and of Latin American countries. We also attach great importance to strengthening the efforts of the Special Plan of Economic Cooperation for Central America, born within the United Nations, and to increase substantially development assistance programmes for Central American countries.\nIt is only logical that Central America should have to do its share, and it is doing so, at the cost of great sacrifice. But for Costa Rica there is one area where progress has been inadequate: disarmament. For more than a year, with the backing of the United Nations and the Organisation of American States, there have been negotiations among Central American countries on security, arms control and verification. Not having an army, Costa Rica is particularly interested in those issues. Little progress has been made thus far and we still feel that the size of some regional armed forces is disproportionate to the needs and capabilities of Central America. Me firmly believe that the triumph of democracy in all Central American countries should go hand in hand with a change in the perceived role of armies and with a reduction in military budgets. We know that such changes cannot occur overnight, but they will not begin so long as a Central America of freedom does not manifest a clear determination to become also a Central America of comity.\nEfforts to move the disarmament process forward, both in Central America and throughout the world, are vital if we are to lower military spending and increase international cooperation for development. In that connection, my delegation welcomes the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by the Soviet Union and the United States of America, and wishes to highlight the importance of the work of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which Costa Rica has recently joined.\nMy country also considers that there is an urgent need to give priority to international efforts to reduce the nuclear-arms race to a minimum, to avoid the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to cease all nuclear testing. Priority should also be given to regional and global Initiatives on limiting conventional weapons and on international weapons transfers. Costa Rica believes that it is necessary to pay more attention not or y to the problem of weapons sales, but also to gifts of arms and military equipment.\nThe flow of arms, either sold or donated to the third world, only increases the problems of our countries. During the tragic days of the Gulf war it was thought that when it ended strict regulation of this traffic would be established. It proved an empty hope. Arms and military assistance continue to arrive in suffering lands whose inhabitants have drained to the dregs the cup of violence. The third world has shed enough blood. It needs more food and fewer weapons, more doctors and fewer military advisers, more housing and fewer barracks, more access to technology for peace and less to technology for destruction, more scholarships for technical careers and fewer military training courses, more cooperation for economic and social development and fewer resources to kill human beings.\nThe impetus to achieve disarmament, in all its manifestations, is very much in keeping with the decision of the United Nations to dedicate the last 10 years of this millennium to international law and with the need to build a new world order of peace, security and cooperation, as outlined by the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.\nCosta Rica, which depends for its external security on the law of nations, believes that that law should become real and positive, avoiding armed conflict by strengthening preventive measures and machinery to achieve the peaceful settlement of disputes. The new world order should give diplomacy a more important role as an element to prevent conflicts and not merely to resolve them. With this in view, it is necessary to encourage pledges to bring the Organisation up to date with the new world realities and strengthen its actions in international relations.\nDuring its 1993 session the Assembly will consider the problem of rebuilding and revitalising the United Nations. However, it is appropriate to reflect now on some problems that undeniably face the Organization, stemming from the world context in which it was created. For example, in Costa Rica's view we must enhance the role of the General Assembly, where -ill States have one voice and one vote. The Secretary-General's powers must also be increased. It is appropriate to revise the structure and functions of the Security Council, improve the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes and strengthen the role of the International Court of Justice, as the court of last resort in disputes between States.\nBuilding a new world order also involves paying more attention to the economic and social problems of the developing countries. It would be regrettable if a North-South confrontation were substituted for the East-West confrontation. Progress in democracy and freedom must be accompanied by a resurgence of new and more realistic approaches to the problems of underdevelopment, external debt, hunger and poverty, which afflict a large number of the States represented in this Hall. The United Nations has a responsibility to ensure that the new world order overcomes the idea of blocs and introduces an order involving global cooperation for the benefit of all mankind. \nConcern for this common destiny is being shown, in an encouraging manner, is the work of the United Nations in preparing for the Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil next year. Costa Rica, which has emphasised the need to establish a new ecological order of international cooperation, is happy to welcome those most valuable efforts. We urge all Member States to cooperate enthusiastically in them and to define priority courses of action to follow up on the results of the Conference.\nThe problem of the progressive deterioration of the environment affects everyone. Yet ecological disasters continue increasing in number year after year, dimming our chances of making a reality of our desire to bequeath a healthy planet to our children. In this regard, my delegation considers there is an urgent need for the United Nations to play a more effective role in protecting the environment, raising the level of its bodies connected with the subject and the resources devoted to it. But above all Costa Rica believes it is essential to be more realistic. Threats to international security are no longer restricted to the military field. We must be aware that protecting the environment is an international responsibility and that threats to the environment are a threat to international security. Therefore, the new world order should contain functional, realistic machinery to protect the environment, making development possible without destroying the environment, which guarantees man his future. Brazil '92 offers a unique opportunity - perhaps the last - to reconcile differing interests and work together with vision to save our Earth from being turned into a sterile, uninhabitable rock. We Member States cannot and must not fail to take that opportunity.\nWith the same idea of a common destiny transcending frontiers, we should deal in the heart of the United Stations with problems of human rights. Costa Rica, which has made respect for fundamental human rights an essential principle in everyday life, attaches the utmost importance to the world Conference on the subject planned for 1993, and we are deeply grateful for the honour done us in the acceptance of our offer to host the regional meeting for Latin America and Caribbean of the Preparatory Committee for the Conference. We are well aware of the importance of this challenge and we shall spare no effort to ensure that the meeting is successful in every way, as it must be in view of the importance of its purposes. My delegation believes that the Conference will stimulate a strengthening of all the international instruments and mechanisms for protecting human rights and will be a fundamental step forward in ensuring that the twenty-first century is a century of profound respect for inalienable human rights.\nIn his first address in this Hall, on 7 December 1988, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said that International relations\n\\\"will fully reflect the genuine interests of the peoples and effectively serve the cause of their common security only when the human being and his concerns, rights and freedoms become the centre of all things.\\\" (A/43/PV.72, p. 23)\nThat view, which was recently enshrined in the human rights declaration issued in the Soviet Union, should be the cornerstone of the new world order.\nThe collapse of tyrannies and the progressive weakening of the totalitarian regimes that still insist on swimming against the tide of history have certainly resulted in greater respect for human rights.\nYet it is discouraging to note that there are still violations of human rights in many areas of the world that require the international community to make much more energetic efforts to put an end to them. Like the case of the environment, the status of human rights can no longer be regarded as the exclusive concern of States.\nNor should the progress achieved in human rights halt further efforts from being made. For example, although the measures taken to eradicate apartheid in the Republic of South Africa have raised our hopes, Costa Rica believes that it is urgent to achieve the total integration of all the population of that country into a true democracy based on the fundamental principle of absolute equality for all men.\nRespect for human rights and for international law as a whole is a decisive factor for the attainment of a lasting peace in every country of the world. We Costa Ricans, who for generations have enjoyed the benefits of living in peace, view with dismay the violence that continues to prevail in today's world.\nThe situation in the Middle East, which decade after decade fills the front pages of our newspapers, is a time-bomb and is incompatible with the ideal of a new order based on true international harmony. Thus, my delegation hopes for the success of efforts being made to bring about a peace conference in the Middle East at which present differences will be discussed and peacefully resolved through reconciliation, with respect for the human rights of all the peoples of the region. There must be a definitive peace in the Middle East. We are confident that it can be achieved and that its peoples will prove themselves worthy of the great spiritual legacies they have inherited. The three major religions that have enlightened the world all share ideals of brotherhood and recognise the value of forgiveness and reconciliation.\nThere is an equally urgent need to re-establish peace in Yugoslavia. Today, as in 1914, the world's attention is focused on the Balkans, and it is neither right nor realistic to ignore the upheavals occurring there and to argue that circumstances have changed and that the spectre of a world conflagration has disappeared. The United Nations cannot ignore the fact that what is happening in that region goes beyond the boundaries of Yugoslavia and poses a threat to all.\nThe terrible example of the Gulf War is too fresh in our minds for us to maintain that there can be conflicts that are merely local. Wherever breaches of the peace occur, wherever human rights are violated, wherever acts of violence lead to death, destruction and waves of refugees, peace is endangered and the prosperity of all peoples on earth imperilled.\nThe world is increasingly coming to realise a better sense of unity. The phenomenon of integration is occurring with increasing force in the most varied parts of the planet, and it lends greater cohesion to the efforts peoples are making to achieve social and economic development. There are many examples in our hemisphere. President Bush's initiative of the Americas, the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), the Tuxtla Gutierrez Accords, the integration efforts of the three countries of North America and the progressive and growing importance of the Andean Pact structures, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Central American Common Market all demonstrate that the idea of community is becoming ever-more deeply rooted in the soil of America where today - with one exception that we hope will soon cease to be one - democracy and liberty are flourishing and where men hope to build a future based on justice and development.\nCosta Rica hopes that the phenomenon now occurring in the Americas will prevail in the twenty-first century throughout the entire world. Costa Rica looks forward to living in a new millennium in a world of conciliation, not confrontation; a world which faces its problems and shares its successes; a world of democracy based on respect for the human person and human rights; a world in which peoples and countries will be brothers and sisters; a world with a shared horizon of development for all.\nAs the President of Costa Rica, Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, has stated:\n\\\"Today, mankind looks to the future with optimism and hope. He are moving firmly forward towards the construction of a new world in which the cruelty :>f war and the intolerance of ideological fanaticism will give way to the irrepressible power of dialogue and to solidarity and cooperation among peoples. We are building a world that will witness the arrival of a new century of democracy. Never before in history has mankind had such an opportunity to achieve its dreams and its ideals.\\\" All States and all men have the opportunity and the responsibility to make those dreams come true, to participate in the building of a new world, a new international order, and the United Nations, as the coordinator of those efforts, as the embodiment of the spirit of brotherhood that should guide mankind, must play the decisive role of designing and building the shining destiny opening up before us. Let us all contribute to making it a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly and to express our confidence in your ability to ensure the success of this forty-sixth session. Our appreciation is extended also to the outgoing President, Mr. Guido de Marco, for the manner in which he carried out his mandate and for his contribution to reforms in the work of the Assembly.\nThe mandate of the present Secretary-General of the Organisation is coming to an end. Portugal wishes to join all those who have expressed their deep appreciation for the dedication with which he has carried out his duties. This dedication has been decisive for the resolution of several crises and for the enhancement of the credibility of the United Nations as an instrument of peace.\nThe Charter of the United Nations has universal scope. Therefore, the admission of seven new countries is particularly significant because they enhance the representativity of this forum. I welcome the simultaneous admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea - an important sign of the Korean people's aspirations to reunification. And I also stress the special significance of the membership of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, whose commitment to independence and to democratic institutions prevailed over more than four decades of illegal occupation.\nWe are living through a time of change. We can state today that we are in the presence of an overwhelming movement that does not spare even those regions and political regimes that seemed unchangeable. I cannot think of a better example than the one provided by the peoples of the Soviet Union, who championed the restoration of democracy and pluralism. I reiterate here the positions expressed this morning by my Dutch colleague on behalf of the European Community and its member States. The members of the European Community will do everything within their reach to contribute to the economic and social development of all central and eastern European countries, including Albania, to their great efforts toward democratisation and economic reform.\nUnfortunately, there is not just hope and optimism in Europe. Portugal is following with great apprehension the tragic developments in Yugoslavia. The spectre of civil war and the resurgence of exacerbated nationalism in a historically key region for the stability of Europe have compelled the European Community and the member States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to seek a negotiated solution to the internal differences opposing the peoples of Yugoslavia. We consider the escalation of violence unacceptable and we appeal to all forums and to international public opinion to support any efforts aimed at an immediate cease-fire and to negotiations based on good faith.\nIt is a permanent concern of Portuguese foreign policy that the European Community should not stray from its commitments to other continents. In Africa, a continent to which Portugal is linked by historical and cultural ties, there have been developments to which the international community should not remain indifferent. The efforts of an increasing number of countries to democratize their regimes, as well as progress in the field of human rights and the creation of market economies, deserve international recognition.\nI point out the cases of Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe as remarkable examples of a process of political renewal. It is also in this context and in a very special way that Portugal salutes the Angolan nation. Peace in Angola is now a valuable fait accompli, and general elections, in line with the terms of the Estoril agreements, will take place next year. We are certain that with the active support of the international community all Angolans will be able to recover the time lost and rapidly transform their country into one of the major poles of development in southern Africa.\nIn this region of Africa, we continue to support efforts towards the building of a new South Africa, fully democratic and free from any form of discrimination. We welcome the measures already adopted to eliminate apartheid. We welcome too the dialogue that is being established between the main African forces. That dialogue will pave the way for a new South Africa.\nWe also hope that the conflict which has so deeply affected Mozambique will soon come to an end. We support without reservation all initiatives aimed at fostering a genuine peace in Mozambique. We are willing to offer our best cooperation to that end.\nPortugal will make all efforts within the framework of the international organizations of which it is a member, and in particular within the framework of the European Community, to prevent assistance from the industrialized countries to other regions from reducing the flow of financial aid and investments intended for Africa.\nLatin America is also moving gradually towards fuller compliance with the rules of democratic institutions and fundamental rights as well as towards new forms of economic integration and the strengthening of the market system. We reiterate our solidarity with the Governments that are pursuing these goals.\nMy country has a centuries-old history of friendly relations with this region, strengthened by the significant social, economic and cultural contributions of the Portuguese communities that settled in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela.\nI cannot but underline how important it is for the international community to sponsor programmes aimed at sustained and equitable economic development. We also favour creative and flexible plans to solve the question of the region's foreign debt, which continues to be a considerable hindrance to the progress and the future of its peoples.\nPortugal has also been following with great interest the peace process in Central America, a region where the United Nations has played a major role in the search for a negotiated solution to questions that are vital to the stability of the countries involved.\nIn this context we hope that current efforts will lead to true national reconciliation in El Salvador and in Guatemala. Within a framework of dialogue and cooperation, we hope that the eighth meeting of the San Jose conference, to be held in Lisbon, will give a significant impetus to real and harmonious progress in the region.\nThe dramatic changes and emerging trends we have been witnessing on the international scene give us reason to believe that the right of the people of East Timor to freedom and self-determination will not be forgotten after more than 15 years of illegal Indonesian occupation carried out by the use of force and in blatant disregard of the basic principles of the Charter and the resolutions of the both General Assembly and the Security Council, which have yet to be implemented.\nOne of the main lessons we can draw from the developments we are currently witnessing - the restoration of the rights of self-determination and independence of the Baltic States and the rejection of the illegal occupation of Kuwait - is that situations based on the suppression of the legitimate rights of peoples and of their cultural, social and linguistic identity are inherently fragile and are bound to fail. While the last of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are being led to the final stages of their decolonization processes - and I recall in this context the recent accession to independence and admission to the United Nations of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, both situated in the Pacific region and, like several other Member States of the United Nations, much smaller and less populous than East Timor - regrettable anachronisms still persist in East Timor in the last decade of the present century, a decade proclaimed by the United Nations as devoted to the eradication of colonialism.\nIn the case of East Timor - a Non-Self-Governing Territory for which Portugal is still responsible as the administering Power recognized by the United Nations - fundamental principles are at stake. The defence of those principles has been a determining factor in some of the most significant actions undertaken by this Organization and, in particular, by the Security Council. I am referring to the principles of the non-use of force and the inadmissibility of illegitimate military conquest as an acceptable claim for territorial enlargement; respect for the right to self-determination of colonial peoples; and upholding the basic human rights and freedoms of both peoples and individuals.\nWe are convinced that the international community as a whole, and the United Nations in particular, should be involved in a more consistent and committed manner in the search for a political settlement of this question based on respect for the principles I have just mentioned. In fact, it is those principles that are at stake in East Timor, and not an alleged bilateral dispute between Portugal and Indonesia. The last 15 years have proved that widespread repression and the use of force have not been able to consolidate the illegal status quo imposed upon the Territory. They have rather prompted the East Timorese people to a stubborn and undaunted resistance and to a protest movement that very few would have ever dared anticipate.\nPortugal, living up to its responsibilities, has been systematically drawing the international community's attention to the seriousness of the situation prevailing in East Timor and to the need to bring it to an end through the free exercise of the right to self-determination and through respect for the human rights and identity of the people. We have also cooperated closely with the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General. Under his auspices, an agreement was recently reached between Portugal and Indonesia on the terms of reference for a proposed visit to East Timor to be undertaken soon by a Portuguese parliamentary delegation in order to obtain first-hand information on the situation.\nWe hope that this Initiative will lead to the resumption of a real dialogue involving all parties legitimately concerned and contribute to increased awareness by the international community of the need to solve that problem in accordance with the universally accepted principles that the United Nations has the mandate to promote and defend.\nThe European Community declarations of Venice and Madrid constitute solid reference points for Portuguese foreign policy regarding the Middle East; in our view, respect for international legality - in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) - should guide all parties involved.\nIn this context we support the initiatives of the United States Administration based on a full commitment and a profound knowledge of the nature of the conflict. He call on the parties involved to take advantage of this historic opportunity.\nPortugal, a country with historical and cultural links with northern Africa, has been giving its support to the pioneering integration initiatives of the Arab Maghreb Union, which have greatly contributed to cooperation with Europe and to strengthening dialogue in the Mediterranean. I wish now to address briefly a few issues that, because of their significance, have increasingly become the focus of attention in the United Nations and, naturally in my country.\nI shall refer first to the preservation of the environment. The issues to be discussed in this area concern Governments and citizens, and industrialized and developing countries. The environmental policies established now will ultimately determine the inheritance of future generations. We must not fail in this endeavour.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development that will take place in June of next year in Rio de Janeiro deserves special mention. Portugal hopes that at the Conference all participants will pledge their firm political commitment to enable a rational exploration of natural resources and alleviate the damaging effects of environmental degradation.\nIn the human rights field, Portugal reaffirms its commitment to the cause of the immediate abolition of capital punishment, consistent with the positions that we have put forward in various forums, namely, within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Council of Europe and the United Nations. We welcome the recent entering into force of the Second Additional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which aims at the abolition of capital punishment. We appeal for the timely ratification of this instrument, whose geographical implementation is, unfortunately, still limited.\nPortugal joins the overwhelming majority of countries in their concern for the tragic situation faced by victims of natural disasters and conflicts over which, in most cases, they have no control. The solution to these situations must be provided by a better coordination of existing humanitarian aid mechanisms.\nTherefore, we hope that the Assembly will take into account the initiative of the States members of the European Community on emergency humanitarian aid and will approve a resolution on this issue. This is an instance where solidarity among the various countries and the United Nations can alleviate the suffering of millions.\nTo conclude, I should like to state the Portuguese position regarding the responsibility that the Member States should have in the future activities of our Organisation.\nThe developments I have been mentioning are raising expectations in world public opinion. Most answers can be found within the framework of the United Nations. In fact this forum is going through a crucial period of its history and for the first time, owing to the considerable easing of international tensions, is in a position to address pending issues related to the essential objectives of the Charter.\nPortugal urges all Member States to participate actively in this task and stresses that the United Nations of tomorrow will constitute a forum where the problems and conflicts still besetting the globe can be discussed freely, without any restriction.\nThis is a challenge for all of us, as we share the common responsibility of eliminating the deep political, social and economic imbalances that continue to affect the peoples of this planet, particularly in the context of North-South relations.\nOnly in an integrated way and through dialogue and international cooperation will it be possible to overcome the difficulties and roadblocks that affect the international community. Portugal will do everything within its power to achieve these goals. It is in this spirit that we are participating in the present session of the General Assembly. It is also in this spirit that we look forward to undertaking the presidency of the European Community in 1992.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYou have the delicate task, Mr. President, of presiding over the Assembly's work at a particularly sensitive time in the history of international relations. We assure you of our delegation's support; we know that we may have full confidence in you in view of your diplomatic talents and your experience. Your country and mine enjoy particularly good relations in a variety of fields, a clear sign of solid friendship and shared interests. I should also like. Sir, to express our great satisfaction with the work of your predecessor, Mr. Guido De Marco, in his conduct of the proceedings of the forty-fifth session.\nWe greet and welcome all those States that have just joined the community of the United Nations the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Estonia and the Republic of Lithuania.\nI also wish to express our whole-hearted appreciation of the Secretary-General's role at the head of our Organization. His patient and calm determination has given the United Nations a solid basis and enhanced its credibility.\nBurkina Paso, with a population of a little Mora than 9 million and covering 274,000 square kilometres of land-locked territory, desires en equal voice with others in the concert of nations in raising questions and making proposals.\nThe past 24 months have changed the international scene. Everywhere we hear appeals for cooperation and praise for the rapid change through which we are living. We are told that we are no longer in an era of outspoken demands. Bather, it is a time of conciliation and dialogue, because the forces at work seek not confrontation but the establishment of a new world order based on respect for human rights. That, briefly, is the background to our work.\nHowever, the after-effects and consequences of the East-West rivalry as well as its internal dynamics, for good or ill, continue to affect various regions of the world.\nWe are also witnessing the phenomena of fusion and fission. While we talk about regrouping, about the formation of largo groups, we see some large groups breaking up. At a time when we extend recognition, on the emergence of new sovereignties, we hear talk of a duty to intervene.\nAll these ideas are jostling with each other, without any focus on their future. It is natural in any period of major change to see the overturning of ideas and realities and the multiplication of the contradictions inherent in the sudden speeding up of history. Transitions - fraught as they are with those elements - are producing a balance of forces which is shaping the future. The question which arises is to what extent will the vast majority of mankind benefit from this evolution?\nDistressing events and upheavals are convulsing southern Africa. The apartheid of the Pretoria regime continues to jeopardise the economic health and stability of the front-line States. A particularly heavy price is being paid by Mozambique. RENAMO continues its grim work of sabotage and destruction; and it is impeding the talks which have begun. Burkina Faso recognizes the merit of the Mozambican authorities in continuing on the path of a negotiated settlement and a resumption of the negotiations and we wish to express our feelings of encouragement and solidarity to the people of Mozambique.\nIn Angola, the Alvor Agreements, with the cooperation of all countries, both inside and outside the subregion, must quite clearly improve the situation and promote peace.\nIn South Africa, we must welcome the abolition by Mr. de Klerk of the legislative pillars of apartheid. However, one of the bases of apartheid remains, namely its current Constitution. Also, we must deplore the manoeuvres of the Pretoria regime culminating in the violence which we have all helplessly witnessed in recent months. The international community - all ton familiar with those abominable methods - must maintain sanctions in order to accelerate the process of eliminating apartheid. Thus, Burkina Faso supports the continuation of negotiations in South Africa with a view to adopting the provisional measures necessary to create a totally democratic South Africa. In this spirit, together with the Non-aligned Movement, we support the idea of a democratically elected constituent assembly.\nIn West Africa, in the case of Liberia, the Yamoussokro Summit of 16 September is just one more effort undertaken by the Committee of Mediation and the Committee of Five, strongly supported by Burkina Faso within the framework of the implementation of the peace plan put forward by the Economic Community of West African States, to restore peace and to hold free and fair elections.\nIn Western Sahara, for the long process which began after the Spanish disengagement to succeed, we invite all parties to cooperate with the United Nations in order to hold a self-determination referendum after they have accepted the cease-fire of 6 September.\nIn the horn of Africa, tireless efforts must be continued and encouraged to bring about peace and stability in Somalia. Neighbouring Ethiopia has embarked upon a process of reconciliation and transition whose objective is the establishment of a lasting peace in democracy and justice.\nIn Rwanda, we hope that the efforts begun by the subregion and by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to bring about a negotiated and peaceful settlement will be successful.\nIn Central America, the conflicts which were of concern to us at previous sessions have been eased or solved. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General in El Salvador. We also welcome efforts undertaken in the region to make of it a zone of peace, freedom, democracy and development.\nIn Asia, the most recent developments in Cambodia are encouraging and positive and we urge all the parties to continue along this path in order to bring about a rapid, negotiated and peaceful settlement.\nSimilarly, we support the initiatives of the Secretary-General to bring about an overall political settlement in Afghanistan.\nWe also support the peaceful and independent reunification of North and South Korea on the basis of their joint communique of 4 July 1972. Once again, we bid them welcome hare. Kuwait has been liberated. At the time, we all condemned the invasion and we welcome the return of the Kuwaiti authorities and the restoration to the Kuwaiti people of its rights and prerogatives.\nThe sufferings they endured have left a very deep mark on the region and the work of reconciliation should be persistent and sustained. War is always horrible. Its ravages make no distinction between victims and aggressors. The first victims are always women and children. The conflict in the Gulf was no exception. It occurred at a time when East-West confrontation was fading and international relationships were being re-defined. Its beginning, development and conclusion, at both the military and political levels, has clearly changed the structure of international relations. The notion of a new world order had been mentioned long before 2 August 1990. However, at this time what do we know of its shape and its content? Have the Security Council and the United Nations - mobilised as never before - really lived up to the expectations of the international community? If so, are we entitled to expect the same determination, the same effectiveness, the same seal in solving present or future problems? Will the new world order be based on the universal message of the Charter or on the harsh and selective realities of the international balance of forces? In the circumstances, what is to be the role of the have-nots - the immense multitude of people who are suffering from hunger, thirst, ignorance and diaease7 In a word, are these unfortunates to remain outside or are they to enter our family house so that we can all sit down together as brothers, to share and to grow together?\nIf there is one part of the world which is troubled, if there is one region of the world which is torn apart, it is the Middle East which enjoys this doubtful privilege.\nThe questions which are still being asked when we examine the Palestinian question are: How can those who have suffered from the lack of a homeland in all conscience deny others the right to a homeland? How, today, can it be possible to confiscate from people land on which they have lived uninterruptedly for centuries to give it to new arrivals and to claim that the former are not really in their rightful homes? How can one want for oneself what one does not want for others? The United Nations Charter contains principles which repudiate this mode of thought and conduct.\nThat is why the United Nations has adopted the principle of an international peace conference for the Middle East, not to complicate matters but rather to lay down the foundations of a just and lasting peace. We cannot stifle the voice of a people fighting for its rights and if Burkina Faso today associates itself with other Members of the United Nations in bidding a warm welcome to Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, it is because a hiatus of 51 years has done nothing to dampen their national ardour or to erode the reality of their rights. And the same can be said for the fierce determination of the Palestinian people. Burkina Faso believes that the concessions made by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) three years ago deserve a response other than that of intransigence and rejection. He see that initiatives are under way to resolve the Middle East situation and we encourage them because they may lead to a just, lasting and fair peace which would take account of the fundamental rights of all parties.\nLebanon itself is emerging from a long and troubled period and we welcome these positive developments with a view to national reconciliation and the restoration of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. A tragedy is unfolding in Yugoslavia, where a civil war has begun. We can only deplore this tragedy, which has affected the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as a symbol and in its European region. Non-alignment was a repudiation of the East-West confrontation and its consequences. This confrontation is yielding to ever more open cooperation. Yugoslavia, a pioneer country, has been stricken at the moment of rapprochement.\nBetween fusion and fission, Europe is moving towards economic integration and a redrawing of political lines. The essence of this lies in the will of the peoples, while survival depends upon the solidarity of people and on an international system based on justice and equity. That system should be based on human rights and political pluralism.\nThe 9 million citizens of my country belong to the multitude of the South. The aspirations of North and South are the same: dignity and security. Human rights are indivisible and to strive for them is the most noble and fruitful thing one can do for humanity, because, beyond talk and manipulation, there is the clear and concrete affirmation that it is indeed the human person that is most important.\nWhen the international community rose up against apartheid, it was defending human rights. When the Non-Aligned Movement fought colonialism, it was defending human rights. When certain nations were colonising territories during the last century, they were claiming to put into practice a certain idea of human rights: their \\\"civilising mission\\\". When certain regions of the world are accused of corruption and the flagrant violation of the rights of the individual, very often those in the South who are corrupted have their counterparts and corrupters in the North, and sometimes vice versa, for such is the balance of the world.\nIf the world is changing, it must change for the better. The risk we all run is that of seeing a re-emergence of dangerous behaviour in the guise of Innocent or consensual ideas. He must not allow the \\\"civilising mission\\\" and human rights to be two sides of the same coin. In other words, the same protagonists must not be allowed in different costumes to act as they did in the past, forcing their way in all good conscience into our societies, which are no better or worse than their own but simply more vulnerable. Yesterday, encroachment took place in the guise of the civilising mission. Today, we must fear encroachment on the pretext of human rights.\nNo one is against human rights, for they are inherent in humanity itself. To entertain only one partial and fragmentary vision of human rights is tantamount to condemning humanity to exploitation and deprivation. The right to development, to food, to a roof over one's head, to basic health care and to education are all parts of human rights as well. Supporting this without recognising and accepting the fundamental nature of the rights of the individual would obviously be an imperfect way of defining and solving the problem. Similarly, to stress the rights of the individual while confining oneself solely to defending them is to refuse to see the world as it is today.\nAll that follows flows from what preceded it. Political pluralism is one form of democracy. Democracy can be political pluralism, but more is needed. That something more is the basis of democracy and overlaps with the rights I have just mentioned. A structurally unfavourable economic environment and a bad economic and social domestic situation are not the soil in which democracy flourishes. Burkina Faso believes that it is axiomatic today that the marriage between democracy and development is indissoluble, linked as these two elements are through permanent interaction. Unfortunately, however obvious it may be, this axiom has not produced its logical consequences.\nThus, the deterioration of the economic situation of Africa, together with its growing marginalization, has condemned 500 million people to stagnation, regression and continuing impoverishment. The 1980a were a lost decade in which the number of least developed countries increased from 28 to 42, the highest proportion of which were African.\nAfrica's external debt is an extremely heavy burden. This debt has increased to the present level of f270 billion. Debt servicing in Africa itself represents on the average more than 25 per cent of export earnings. In some countries of the continent, 100 per cent of export earnings are spent in this way. We should note that 85 to 95 per cent of African exports are primary commodities whose prices is constantly on the decline.\nIn 1980, the United Nations adopted a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Five years later, in spite of policies pursued and reforms undertaken by African countries despite their social and political costs, the industrialised countries have not made the contribution they promised. The consensus at the time described the African economic crisis as essentially structural, requiring for its solution a long-term process undertaken by both the African and the donor countries. The developed countries and international financial institutions were supposed to make a greater contribution not only in terms of an increase in financial flows but also in the terms and conditions of this assistance. But they have not done so. To continue on this path is to condemn Africa to a decade even worse than the 1980s.\nIn this regard, we support the proposal of the Secretary-General to convene an international conference on the financing of development. The Economic and Social Council has followed up on this proposal and invited the General Assembly to examine it at its current session. Similarly, we welcome the decision of the Japanese Government to organise an international conference in 1993 on development in Africa with the participation of African heads of State. For our part, the signing of the Treaty establishing the Pan-African Economic Community reflects our wish to bring about economic integration in order to meet current and future challenges.\nBurkina Faso has always stressed and continues to stress the importance of international cooperation based on justice and solidarity. Whether that cooperation is South-South or North-South, its goal must be to obtain balanced economic growth and development for all. That goal will not be achieved if there is no adequate support for development strategies and if we continue to see such protectionist practices on the part of the North as the Uruguay Round.\nIt therefore seems to us that it is of the utmost importance to reconcile human rights and the right to development in a period as crucial as that of the transition towards democracy. Upon this depends the success of the whole process under way in our countries. In this regard, on 2 June 1991, the people of Burkina Faso adopted by referendum a constitution which now governs the life of the nation. The process begun will be continued until the establishment of new institutions following pluralistic and free elections on 1 December 1991 for the presidency and on 12 January 1992 for the legislative assembly.\nWith regard to the environment, on the eve of the Brazil 1992 Conference, no one any longer questions the reality and gravity of the threat hanging over our planet because of the deterioration of our environment. We all know, developed and developing countries alike, that the developed countries by far bear the greatest responsibilities in the process of degradation. The series of preparatory meetings which have gone on since the adoption of resolution 44/228 of 22 December 1989, on the convening of the Rio de Janeiro Conference, demonstrates the awareness of the States and regions of the world.\nMeasures have now been taken locally by certain countries on the basis of the recommendations stemming from those preparatory meetings. That is the case with my own country, Burkina Faso. However, the more we think about it, it is becoming clear that the restoration and preservation of the environment is a long-term task, not to say a permanent task, and that will require enormous human, material, technological and financial resources which, for the most part, are beyond the range of our weak economies. Only joint action by North and South can succeed in meeting the task.\nBefore concluding I should like to reassert the conviction of Burkina Faso that most of the problems of our world can be solved only by dialogue and negotiation between developed and developing countries with a view to bringing about specific solutions through a multilateral approach to these problems.\nThe United Nations today numbers 166 Members which have ratified the Charter. The ideals of 1945 are still applicable today, although the world has changed a great deal. It is time to take another look not only at the goals but also at the kind of response that the Organization can give to the questions of the day and to its own functioning. For our part we should like to see an Organisation that is ever more efficient and involved for the greatest good of the greatest number. Never has mankind been so great and also so vulnerable; the world is experiencing both abundance and total destitution. It is time for our Organisation to bring to fruition all its patient and laborious work for the prosperity of mankind, for peace, security and a more just and more humane order.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe international order born out of the Second World Mar is dead. We have seen an end to a stage in history marked by the cold war, the bipolar division of world power and the division of the planet into two major areas of influence where small countries were mere geopolitical pawns of the major Powers and where mankind was subjected to the balance of terror. With the moat recent world events, a new epoch in history has dawned. It is characterised, from a political standpoint, by the democratisation of formerly authoritarian, centralised societies; in the economic field, by the establishment of major blocs, the opening up of markets, the removal of customs barriers and the free flow of goods, services, capital, technology and other production factors; on the international scene, by detente and the search for peace; and in the military sphere, by disarmament and the dismantling of the two major strategic alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact, which for so long kept mankind in a state of anxiety, living under the constant threat of death.\nThese changes took place so rapidly that we have barely been able to study them, interpret, them or fully grasp their hidden meaning. That is because history is being made at an increasingly rapid pace as a result of scientific and technological progress. Changes in human society are now occurring more rapidly in one decade than they used to In the span of a century.\nI would even say that the twentieth century is over, that it was born with the First World War - in 1914 - and ended with the crumbling of the Berlin Wall. Major events in the life of mankind are epoch-making and constitute milestones in history. Just as in the year 476 the downfall of the Roman Empire signalled the end of ancient times and the start of the Middle Ages; just as in 1492 the discovery of America gave rise to the modern era; just as the French Revolution is the demarcation between the modern era and our contemporary world; and just as the explosion of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ushered in the current era - so the fall of the Berlin Wall signified the end of the twentieth century. For that was not merely a wall that divided a city into two parts, but the symbol of the implacable hostility between two philosophical, political, economic and social systems.\nEvents in the Soviet Union, viewed from the standpoint of philosophical history, signify the fall of one of the major empires, for from the dialectical standpoint those events are only ephemeral stages in history. All products of nature, man, history and culture arise, develop, reach their zenith and then decline. This has happened throughout history, with the Persian, Roman, Muslim and Ottoman Empires, as well as with the many other power centres that arose over the centuries. Marxism had failed in practice. Those who embraced it strayed from its original essentially liberating intent; they hastened on the path of authoritarianism; they Imposed upon their societies the aberration of a single-party system; they suppressed the fertile power of freedom; they perpetuated the dictatorship of the proletariat, which through a series of supplantations resulted in the party replacing the proletariat, the apparat the party, and the leadership, the apparat and, ultimately, they placed power in the hands of a small group of eminent leaders who made all the decisions, who commanded and countermanded, did and undid everything in their respective societies.\nOn the other hand, the stratification of the means of production clearly resulted in a loss of the dynamism in their economies. Government control over the means of production soon led to the class interests of the high echelons of bureaucracy, and with that there re-emerged the old contradiction - which had already been condemned in the 1848 Communist Manifesto - between the oppressor and the oppressed. However, while that may be so, and while the political and economic theses of Marxism may have failed in their historical applications, one cannot but credit them for having been the first to denounce the insensitive moral values of an unjustly structured society; the abuses of the unbridled capitalism of the nineteenth century, and the economic selfishness of the ruling classes. Paradoxically, I would even say that the theses of Marxism failed in practice, but none the less they compelled the world to change course.\nWith the East-West controversy fading away, the North-South economic contradiction between the wide-ranging, dominant developed world and the backward, dependent developing world is becoming apparent. As regards Latin America, we are living through the paradoxical and tragic situation of a political democracy achieved after many years of great endeavour and of economic underdevelopment resulting in social injustice, want and dependency on the outside world. In reality, we have but scraps of democracy - that is, political democracy - but we lack economic and social democracy.\nIndeed, never before have the frontiers of political democracy seen as wide as they are today in Latin America; never have so many countries lived under democratic regimes in our region. Virtually all Latin American countries have Governments elected by popular vote. But political progress has not been translated into economic prosperity and social well-being. On the contrary, our democratic systems have inherited the heavy burden of crisis: reduced income, deterioration in the quality of life of the peoples, disproportionately high debt as compared with ability to pay, decrease in the influx of fresh capital for our economic development, serious problems in the external sector, worrisome macroeconomic disorders, long-suppressed social demands - and all this hand in hand with well-known structural deficiencies.\nThis brings about at least two dangers the first is that the democratic regimes find themselves in a situation in which they cannot provide appropriate answers and satisfactory solutions when they have to meet the longstanding, legitimate demands of their peoples; secondly, there is the issue of the ability to govern societies tormented by so many social problems. Clearly, this makes the task of government an extremely difficult enterprise. Our democracies are sailing through dangerous waters, and in the midst of the tempest we Latin American statesmen are trying to maintain the course, without abandoning our democratic goals and with an open debate of ideas with respect to human rights and a free press.\nThe United Nations has carried out an exceptionally important mission over the past 46 years in the maintenance of peace and security in the world. The United Nations had to face so many storms arising out of the cold wars the question of Palestine; the many conflicts in the Middle East; the Korean war; the problem of the Congo; the division of Cyprus; the civil war in the Dominican Republic in 1965; the dispute between India and Pakistan; the Viet Nam war; the Afghanistan conflict, whose settlement was the first step in the process of East-West detente and in which the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister, Diego Cordovea, played a major role; the question of Angola; the problem of Namibia; the pacification of Central America; the Iraq-Kuwait war; and so many other conflicts which were faced with resolve and with prudence by the world Organization.\nNevertheless, the new conditions in which the world is living demand that the United Nations play a new role. The cold war ended, but today we must wage war against poverty. We must finance peace instead of war. We must work for life and not for death. We must create a more ethical and rational world. The economic and social challenges are at the forefront of our task.\nImproving the quality of life of our peoples is an imperative, and international social justice is a prerequisite to establishing peace in the world. Therefore new prospects are opening up to the United Nations in the field of development and in promoting the human dimension of economic development, particularly with regard to the more backward areas of the globe.\nLet me take this opportunity to express on behalf of my Government and people our moat resolute support for the initiative taken by the United Nations Economic and Social Council to convene a summit meeting to deal more thoroughly with social development and seek new ways capable of assessing human development more precisely.\nPeace is a universal, indivisible benefit, and we must realize that when peace anywhere is threatened world peace is also undermined. This principle becomes increasingly important in scope and stature in relations among States. The people of Ecuador wish to live in peace. Ecuador is in fact an oasis of peace. To us, peace is the main economic resource for our development. We want to have peace based on justice, peace understood as respect for the rights of others, in accordance with the clear and always timely definition of the famous Mexican leader of the last century, Benito Juarez.\nThat peace must be linked to respect for the Amazonian rights of my country - a topic I should like to raise in the Assembly. Ecuador and Peru have for many years had a territorial dispute which remains unresolved. This problem continues to affect peace, security and regional integration, and it has long posed potentially dangerous tensions for the region. My Government has dealt with this subject with the utmost seriousness and responsibility.\nAs is well known, I came to power after three tries - that means that I had to go through three electoral campaigns, during which I made thousands of speeches. Yet, never in those speeches did I make use of the issue of the territorial problem with Peru, because I always felt that this question was of such importance to the very destiny of my country that it was inadmissible to bring it up in electoral campaign speeches. Ever since I became President, I have striven to create a climate of detente and cordiality with Peru to allow us to find a peaceful settlement of the problem. I was the first Ecuadorian President to visit Peru in the entire history of our country. Reciprocally, Alan Garcia was the first Peruvian Head of State to come to Ecuador. On 22 May of last year in the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu, in Peru, at the inauguration of the summit meeting of Presidents of the Andean Group, I stated \\\"The two visits stem from our mutual desire to create a climate of detente, peace, tranquillity, cordiality, understanding and mutual confidence, a climate in which at some point of time we shall be able to discuss our bilateral problems regarding which we have opposing views and opinions.\\\"\nMy conduct at all times has shown that I want peace and that I want to see peaceful solutions to our problem. With the moral authority vested in me, and in view of the fact that my country has at all times adhered to the tenets of the Charter on the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the rejection of territorial Acquisition by force and the refusal to acknowledge that military victory creates rights, 1 call upon Peru from this highest and most prestigious rostrum available to mankind to settle peacefully our long-standing problem and territorial dispute through the arbitration of Pope John Paul II. Arbitration is one of the peaceful means for the settlement of disputes recognized by international law. It demonstrated its effectiveness in the settlement of the dispute between Argentine end Chile not long ago on the Beagle question. The people of Ecuador and the people of Peru, both profoundly Christian, will abide by such a decision with respect. I propose to Peru that we live in peace and that we work together to foster development, social justice and the improvement of the quality of life of our peoples.\nI call upon Peru to join with us to decrease military expenditures, so that we may devote our best efforts, energies and financial resources to productive endeavours.\nI urge Peru to open an era of peace and mutual trust between our countries no that, free from the fear of the horrors of war, we may move forward together along the path of progress. 1 urge the Head of State of Peru and all the other Heads of State of South American countries to declare solemnly our region a zone of peace. Let us develop a concept of democratic security in keeping with economic and human development needs. Let us abandon the use or threat of force in the settlement of disputes. Let us make our borders places for encounter and friendship. Let us say \\\"no\\\" to armaments and \\\"no\\\" to the nuclearisation of Latin America. I propose this in the name of equity, justice and peace - all values of mankind's civilised coexistence.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure and an honour for me to extend to you, Mr. President, our congratulations on your assumption of your office, which reflects our unanimous recognition of your qualities. This is a tribute said to you by the forty-sixth session, as an expression of the high esteem with which it regards the values you stand for, and a reaffirmation of the Organisation's confidence in your country, in recognition of the outstanding role it has been playing in this Organization from the very beginning. This is a happy opportunity for me to convey the congratulations of Algeria to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to which we are bound by a heritage of culture, a common destiny and ties of constructive fraternal cooperation. As head of the Algerian delegation, I and my delegation will always be at your side to support you in the discharge of the noble and major task entrusted to you.\nYou have succeeded your predecessor, Mr. de Marco, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, who had demonstrated exemplary devotion in the service of world peace at one of the most critical times in the history of the Organisation, and I would sincerely commend him for his efforts.\nI also wish to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has spared no effort in upholding the values of peace throughout the world and who has lent his outstanding style to the work of the Organization. Because of his tireless efforts in the service of the purposes and principles of this Organisation, he deserves the thanks and appreciation of the entire international community.\nOur Assembly at this session has seen the admission to membership of seven new Members, and we warmly welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. We wish their peoples stability and prosperity and we will cooperate with them within this Organisation and in all fields.\nThe rapid events that we have seen recently remind us of the well-known idea that change is the only constant element in history. Indeed the collapse of the Berlin wall, the disappearance of an enormous military bloc overnight and the intensive endeavours to reconstruct the European home in an atmosphere that is charged with hope and danger at one and the same time - all these and many other events as well have brought to an end an historic phase that was based on bipolarity in international relations. Thus change has become the decisive word in all that is written or said in assessing the world situation. The terminology and ideas of the cold war era are no longer valid in describing that situation. However, while there are now peoples that are masters of their own fate, peoples that are able to chart their own future and ensure their security and prosperity, we must admit that there are vast regions of the world whose peoples are at the mercy of crises and problems and even wars. Those peoples, which wonder what the future holds for them, constitute the overwhelming majority of humanity. So far, they have not seen positive changes in their material or moral situation as a result of the historic changes that have taken place. Therefore, the question that is being asked insistently is: how can we move forward from the cold-war era, which has ended, to the new international order of which there is so much talk nowadays? We believe that the United Nations is at the same time the proper framework and indeed the only means that we can use if we wish to attain the goals and realize the aspirations of all and defend everyone's interests in an atmosphere of trust and equality between all countries, whether rich or poor, strong or weak, preserving absolute respect for the principles on which this Organization was built, and the goals it has set for itself.\nTurning to the Gulf crisis, this was a sore trial for the United Nations, because it led to an upheaval in the Arab world and has left an aftermath in the region which will be felt by the region and its peoples for a long time, because this aftermath is not confined to the bloodshed and the destruction of tremendous material resources. The United Nations is now working to deal with the causes which led to the eruption of that crisis in the Gulf, so as to avoid the repetition of a similar tragedy, to safeguard the sovereignty of all States of the region and their independence, to repair the damage that has been done and to restore rights.\nHowever, the credibility of the Organisation requires urgently that actions that are undertaken within the framework of the Organization do not lead to the punishment of a people which has been the primary victim of this tragedy whose consequences the international community is trying to eradicate. To be clear, we appeal to this Organisation and all States working in this context to see to it that the suffering of the people of Iraq is alleviated and that the sanctions that have been imposed on it are lifted as soon as possible.\nWe have known for a long time now that the question of Palestine and the question of South Africa are two problems which have a colonialist character. The consideration of this question is more difficult than the examination of any other similar questions. The two crises have seen parallel developments over the years, but now we are witnessing positive changes, which are very encouraging, in the case of South Africa, whereas the situation remains critical and complicated in the case of Palestine. I call upon this Assembly to consider this disparity. I also call upon the Assembly to analyse the causes of this disparity and to draw the necessary conclusions. Personally, I believe that the main cause of this disparity stems from the fact that the firm position of collective solidarity adopted by the international community vis-\u00e0-vis the minority in South Africa was the reason that made the Pretoria regime bow to the will of the international community, change its policies and move towards a position that is more compatible with the requirements of the age and international legality. \nAs for Palestine, the policy of tolerance and connivance adopted by the major States - States that have influence on Israel and its daily excesses - has encouraged the Israeli leaders to persist in this well-known intransigence and to disregard all resolutions and international conventions. Thus, on the one hand, the international pressures that were brought to bear on the white minority in South Africa have led to the independence of Namibia, the release of Nelson Mandela, the abolition of the basic laws of the apartheid regime, the closing down of the infamous Robben Island prison, and the emergence, as a result of all this, of a political climate that justifies optimism with regard to the future of that country, even if the skies there are not completely cloudless. On the other hand, Israel persists in its extremist intransigent policies. Its repressive practices are being escalated daily. Some time ago, Arab Jerusalem, as well as the Golan Heights, were annexed, and southern Lebanon is still under occupation. The Geneva Conventions are still being flouted. Palestinian lands are being confiscated every day. Thousands of Jewish immigrants are coming in from the Soviet Union and other regions. Settlements are being erected in all the occupied Arab territories, and every time the Palestinian and Arab sides make concessions, Israel, for its part, imposes conditions and makes new demands.\nToday, we are told that, in the context of the new international order, and in the wake of the Gulf crisis, the question of Palestine in particular and the Middle East conflict in general will find some solution in total respect for international law and in keeping with the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. From our point of view, the current efforts to achieve dynamic action leading to a comprehensive and just solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict are very important, and we appreciate the efforts of all the participants. But, despite all these efforts, the Palestinian people does not find therein even the minimum of its aspirations. We fear that the tolerant attitude that the international community adopts towards Israel may prevent those initiatives from having any positive results.\nToday, the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people are meeting in the capital of my country. They are doing all they can to shoulder their responsibility to facilitate the emergence of the solution for which we all hope.\nEveryone knows that my country supports the Palestinian people. We have always supported all peoples that have been victims of repression and have fought for their independence and dignity. We recognize the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, just as we recognize the African National Congress, which has raised high the standard of struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa. He still give assistance to the PLO, just as we continue to support the liberation movement in South Africa.\nWe support the efforts to arrive at a just and lasting solution to the Middle East crisis. At the same time, we support the work that is being done to lay the foundations for real democracy, under which an end will be put to the domination of the white minority regime in South Africa. We are fully prepared to shoulder our responsibilities by participating in the peace conference on the Middle East if we are firmly convinced that our participation would really contribute to the attainment of a just peace for all and, in particular, for the Palestinian people. \nThe negotiations on disarmament have led to achievements which we welcome. We sincerely hope that the efforts that are being made in various fields will continue with a view to achieving the goals that are set down in the many General Assembly resolutions concerning disarmament.\nIt is with satisfaction that we draw particular attention to the major progress that has been made in the Geneva Conference on Chemical Weapons. Algeria expresses its appreciation of these positive developments and takes this opportunity to announce its accession to four treaties: the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare; the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof; the Convention on the Prohibition of Military and any other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques; and the Treaty on the Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. This is the first stage of Algeria's contribution to the collective effort that is needed if the aspirations of the United Nations and those of the peoples of the world in the various fields of disarmament are to be realized.\nFor three years now, the countries of the Arab Maghreb have been implementing a constructive project that is of great interest to all countries of the region. It is now passing through a new stage, which seeks to consolidate the basis of the union and its institutional infrastructure, as well as its consultative and executive bodies. The plan for Maghreb unity seeks to consolidate peace in the region, and its goals are influenced objectively by every effort to consolidate peace, stability and cooperation in the Arab world - in Africa and in the Mediterranean basin.\nDue to the adoption by the Security Council resolution 690 (1991) which established the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara to monitor the Sahraoui people's referendum for self-determination, we are moving, at last, towards a final solution to that dispute. It is necessary that the settlement process be carried out within the timeframe established by the United Nations, and the parameters envisaged, that is to say without the exertion of any pressure by any party. Indeed, the entry into force of a cease-fire on the date established by the Secretary-General and the deployment of the United Nations Mission in the Western Sahara have restored trust in the international community and have revived the hope that peace can be achieved.\nAlgeria reaffirms once more its resolve with regard to the implementation of the settlement plan for Western Sahara and its confidence in the Secretary-General, who has earned the appreciation of the international community through his constant efforts and his patience.\nThere are conflicts in other regions as well, so we must make every effort to find solutions thereto.\nIn Afghanistan there is new hope that, between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the situation can be resolved peacefully, in cooperation with neighbouring countries and with the support of the United Nations.\nLikewise, everyone views the presence here of a delegation from Cambodia's Supreme National Council, the representative of the sovereign authority in that country, as proof of the confidence felt by the parties to the conflict. This is of great importance to our efforts to achieve national reconciliation in Cambodia.\nTurning to Cyprus, we hope that the Secretary-General's efforts will enable that country to recover its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.\nIn Lebanon the fighting has stopped and peace has been restored. The Lebanese authorities continue the work of national reconciliation and rebuilding national unity through implementation of the Taif agreements. The international community must shoulder its responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis the Lebanese people by ensuring that Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon, pursuant to Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and by establishing an international fund for the reconstruction of Lebanon.\nThe major transformations we have been witnessing in international relations have not produced similar positive changes in economic relations or international economic cooperation. The heavy burden of external debt and the restrictions imposed on the access to the markets of the developed countries by the commodities of developing countries; inflation; rising interest rates; deteriorating terms of trade; the drop in official development assistance; and meagre flows of foreign investment to developing countries: all these constitute heavy burdens that hamper the work of reform undertaken by developing countries. The deteriorating climate of international economic relations is widening the gap between the North and the South.\nTake for example the deteriorating situation in Africa, which is in stark contrast to international commitments undertaken in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development in Africa. The renaissance of the United Nations can achieve its goals completely only if the demands of developing countries are placed at the top of international agendas. In that connection, the Secretary-General's proposed international conference for development financing deserves support as it would provide the appropriate forum for concerted efforts to solve the basic problems facing us.\nWe attach particular importance to the decision of the Economic and Social Council that work should be done to ensure that capital is not directed to Eastern Europe to the detriment of the countries of the South.\nA genuine recovery of international cooperation through commitments undertaken at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly, on international economic cooperation, and through implementation of the goals and policies set out in the International Development Strategy, depends first and foremost on the political will of all Member States. Restructuring the economic and social sectors of the United Nations, revitalizing the Economic and Social Council and efforts to bolster the practical work carried out by the United Nations can all lend credibility and effectiveness to international action. That in turn can stimulate greater political collective will to meet these challenges.\nDeveloping countries know full well that development must depend above all on their own efforts. On that basis, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 have adopted the principle of collective and individual self-reliance for developing countries. For that reason, we have adopted agreements on establishing African economic union and on economic complementarity among the Maghreb countries, free-trade agreements with countries of Latin America as well as the dynamism of the economic groupings in Asia represent efforts to consolidate South-South cooperation, despite the many types of obstacles and difficulties we are facing.\nIn fact, those efforts do not reflect a tendency on the part of countries of the South towards isolation. Neither are they an alternative to the fabric of international economic relations or to cooperation between all States.\nThat is why those efforts in no way lessen the international community's responsibility to work for the development of the entire international community.\nThe domestic changes that we have seen in Algeria are primarily a response to what we hope will be the reflection of the aspirations of our society: a democratic, responsible life. The thrust of those changes can have some effect, which we hope will be positive, on peace, stability and cooperation throughout the region. The establishment of political associations, the independence of juridical power and the strict observance of human rights are all factors which affect all strata of society. They are factors that help further consolidate real democracy, which we are establishing in Algeria.\nDespite the difficulties involved in such an experiment, Algeria is determined to continue along this path and work for the consolidation of democracy. He hope that these efforts will lead to the achievement of human aspirations with the consolidation of the legitimate rights of individuals and society as a whole, and that this will be accompanied by proper international action breaking new ground to produce effective global cooperation.\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our commitment to real cooperation with all Member States to establish the new international order to which all peoples aspire, a new order based on consultation and dialogue, democratic practices and cooperation, and not on conditions imposed by the strong on the weak or the rich on the poor.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe meet today as the end a year that began with a crisis. The United Nations confronted that crisis and resolved it. Standing tall in the midst of that crisis, threatened but undaunted, welcoming assistance but marching out first, in the vanguard of its own defence and the redemption of its neighbours, was a proud nation called Saudi Arabia. It is fitting that the Assembly should now be presided over by a man from that nation, with an outstanding record of leadership in diplomatic engagements for his country, for his race, for his region and for the world. With Mr. Samir S. Shihabi as our President, we face a historic and most productive session.\nWe had one such session last year, when Mr. Guido de Marco of the Republic of Malta presided over the Assembly and led us to significant, indelible accomplishments towards the restructuring and reform of the United Nations. We congratulate Mr. de Marco as he yields the presidency to Mr. Shihabi.\nI am here to speak for my country, but permit me to note that while I speak for no other country I do stand here proud of our membership in, and this year of our being Chairman of, the Standing Committee of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), to which the Philippines is bound in ever-developing solidarity with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.\nThe history of the Organisation has been marked with calibrations. We are, for instance, at the moment in the middle of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, the International Decade for Eradication of Colonialism, and also the World Decade for Cultural Development. We have already celebrated international years for the woman and the children of the world. Since 1973 there have been on record 21 such United Nations salutes. These celebrations establish the character of the United Nations - and sculpt the milestones of the performance of humankind in this semi-century.\nI submit that our Decade for Action Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, from 1973 to 1983, furnished ideological fuel for the popular movement in South Africa that extracted this year an official declaration, though not yet adequately implemented, to dismantle apartheid. We solemnly marked the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in that year of 1988 during which there began the process for the final solution of the Cambodian crisis. That historic congruence in time, I submit, reminded the negotiators that the process, if it was to be successful, could only culminate in the universal human right of free democratic elections. That right, happily for history, is about to be implemented in Cambodia. We must felicitate the South Africans and the Cambodians on these two human triumphs which are part of an ennobling, victorious, current human momentum that we have so far failed to celebrate. It is the mounting momentum of the people and it has been in progress for a quarter of a century. People have been crushed before, and their momentum has been many times aborted. But \\\"there is no substitute for the people\\\", as Alexander Dubcek told me in Prague last year. The people and time are unconquerable allies.\nSo it began, predictably enough. In Greece, where in four days of November 1973 the people, initially quelled by the army, succeeded in replacing dictatorship with democracy. The power of the people swept southern Europe, leaped to Latin America, Asia, eastern Europe and now southern Africa. Not only heroic individuals but people, masses of people, are changing the face of the Earth, The Philippines could claim a modest share in the propulsion of this momentum of the people. A New York Times editorial has characterised scenes of Muscovites during the recent coup as \\\"reminiscent of Manila's people-power revolt\\\".\nThe power of the people is enshrined in the Philippine 1987 Constitution not only in general preambular terms but in operative provisions that have made us a direct, as well as a representative, democracy. One of the drafters of that document put it this way:\n\\\"The fact that the people elect representatives is not an act of complete trust in those representatives; the people retain the right to review their decisions.\\\"\nOur direct democracy is not only on the village level: it is national. \\\"Direct democracy\\\", says one of our Senators, \\\"is superior to representative democracy.\\\" At this very moment the people of the Philippines are gathering signatures for a national referendum on the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Security which we have signed with the United States of America and which has been rejected by the Philippine Senate. In our direct democracy, we respect our Senate but we also respect our people. Senatus Populusque Romanus: the Senate and the people must rule together.\nIs there a relevance in this to the mission of the United Nations? Ours has become a unipolar world. There are misgivings about this new global condition. It is asked, now that the bipolar balance is gone what is to restrain the solitary super-Power from overstating its duties as keeper of the new world order? The ultimate restraint on the, super Power is Its very system, in which the people are supreme.\nIt was the people in America that pulled this country from a war in South-East Asia which they perceived to be Irrelevant. It. was the same people that cheered America to a precision victory In a Gulf war that they acclaimed as inevitable. It is the same people that are keeping America sober in Its triumphal hour. Indeed, constitutional democracy is not a synonym for peace, nor is it a hard-bound warranty against international violence. But where can we find a more productive forum for peace? Where can we find a more fertile context for transparency and restraint.?\nToday the once theoretical paper dreams of constitutional accessibility and openness have become hard reality. Democratic constitutions have found a new ally: technology. The same laboratories that are enhancing the science of discriminate demolition have already made it possible for humankind to be the instant witness to tragedies of all kinds and in all places. Those scenes can horrify people into demanding openness from their leaders, but the people must be free to make the demands. Electronic transparency could lead to moral, official and diplomatic transparency, and that process could mobilize the restraining forces in society.\nWe must agree with another recent remarkable editorial of The New York Times which warns that outsiders should not redesign the internal policies of nations. But it adds that there is \\\"every reason to proclaim and promote democratic values\\\". The counsel was directed to America. But shall we leave it to America alone to shepherd the values of the world? Can we not find other proclaimers and promoters of democratic values? How about the United Nations? \nIt is wrong to say that the United Nations is only the theatre of States, the agora of International Ideas, the conciliator of multilateral contradictions; for it is more than those categories, however unique, historic and invaluable they may be. The United Nations, I submit. Is above all, indeed, a proclaimer and promoter of values; and let us not evade the words at this Juncture - the United Nations is a proclaimer and promoter of democratic values.\nWhat else is General Assembly resolution 217 A (III) of 10 December 1940, what else is this Universal Declaration of Human Rights, what, else Is this ringing document, but the inventory of constitutional democracy? It Is all there: the right to life, liberty, speech, property, movement., assembly, social services, non-discrimination, participation, down to the specific of \\\"periodic and genuine elections\\\", all essential and standard items in national bills of rights. The General Assembly \\\"proclaims\\\" these rights as \\\"a common standard for all peoples and all nations\\\" and enjoins \\\"every individual and every organ of society\\\" to \\\"promote\\\" them.\nThe United Nations proclaims and promotes democracy and along with it, transparency and restraint. Article 19 gives \\\"everyone\\\" the right \\\"to seek, receive and impart information\\\" and Article 21 identifies the basis of government authority - the \\\"trill of the people\\\", which is also the ultimate restrainer of official abuse.\nThirteen years before the Declaration of Human Rights, there was already an auspicious portent for it in the Charter that gave life to the United Nations in 1945. The Charter opened its preamble with a reaffirmation of \\\"faith in fundamental human rights\\\" and, at the first opportunity, in Article 73 b, in dealing with States in gestation, enjoined the United Nations to develop \\\"free political institutions\\\" in the lands under its trust.\nIndeed, in trust territories there is always the happy, challenging prospect of fresh beginnings. But so are these post-cold-war times a challenge to fresh beginnings.\nMany factors spelled the end of the cold war. But we would be mocking history if we did not recognize that the final verdict that tumbled the walls was rendered by a world of peoples - peoples wishing to end the shackling of their minds, their souls, their political institutions and their economies. The cooling winds of liberalization blew themselves into a gale of democracy which even now is still huffing and puffing at the residual ramparts of involuntary servitude.\nIf the United Nations intends to design a global strategy for peace that will not only dwell on the surface of the issue - or even just below it - but will strike at its roots, it must return to its own roots, recall its resonant declarations and re-sensitise itself to its commitment to the rights of human beings.\nNations are the vital constituents of this Organisation and, of course, the Organisation must never violate the sovereignty of those nations. But I have shown, I hope, that these very nations, united, have not abdicated, but refurbished their own sovereignty by urging themselves and \\\"all peoples ... every Individual and every organ of society\\\" (resolution 217 A (III). seventh preambular paragraph) to promote those values \u00ab-hat are nothing if not the very stuff of constitutional democracy.\nLet the United Nations leadership ensure that every assembly in the United Nations, every council, every court, every organ, shall re-immerse itself in this original mission.\nThere is a responsive, eager world awaiting this leadership. Large land masses have opened themselves to the world - in Eastern Europe, in Africa, in Asia. Our great neighbour, the People's Republic of China, has declared its determination \\\"to implement the policies of reform and opening to the outside world\\\". And this very United Nations has stretched its arms open in welcome to even more of the gallant peoples of the world.\nThe Philippines extends a special welcome to our Pacific neighbours to the East - the Republic of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nWe salute also our two neighbours to the North - the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - whose brotherly simultaneous ingress into our company may soon produce the resurrected unity of a single great nation.\nWe salute those three brave nations of the Baltic Sea - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - who are back at last in their rightful place in the community of nations.\nAnd one last salute to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, that great Asian - noble by blood and by principle - who now leads the Cambodian delegation to this assembly of nations.\nAll of these are triumphs of the people. Since 1973 the people of the world have been speaking and they have been winning. In the last two years the General Assembly has passed resolutions on human development proclaiming that human beings are the goal - not simply the means - of development.\nGross national product statistics are meaningless if they answer only the questions of how well-fed, how well-housed, how well-clothed the people are. The statistics of our computerized bureaus must also respond to the demanding enquiry: how free are these people?\nThe record of the United Nations must contain in detail the ongoing story of the ascent to dignity and freedom of humanity en masse.\nLet the nations of the world applaud the people of the world. For this, indeed, is the quarter century of the people.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should LIKE to convey to Ambassador Samir Shihabi the congratulations of Poland on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. It Is with particular pleasure that I welcome in this high office a representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, one of the founding Members of the Organisation. To the outgoing President, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, whom Poland was pleased to host recently, warm thanks are due for his remarkable leadership of the forty-fifth session. I also wish to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, our respect for and appreciation of his dedicated decade-long service to the United Nations.  We pay a tribute to him for his achievements.\nIt is with special gratification that I welcome in our midst seven new Members of the Organisation! the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Baltic Republics - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It is to be hoped that the admission of the two Korean States will prove to be helpful in unifying the Korean nation. As to the Baltic countries, I wish to say that the new Government of Poland has always supported the aspirations of these old nations to regain their independence. We are happy that the tragic chapter of their history has now finally been closed.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, democracy has been consolidated in Central and Eastern Europe. Recent events in the Soviet Union and the opposition to and failure of the coup d'etat have proved that democratic transformations are irreversible.\nThroughout the Gulf conflict, and after it, the Security Council and the international community at large have been upholding the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. This marks a watershed in the history\nof our Organization and in international relations. The action of the United Nations reaffirms the primacy of international law, sovereignty and equality of States, democratic values and respect for human rights.\nYet we have to make a great and systematic effort. In particular, conflicts and tensions that were, in a sense, immobilized or stabilized by the cold war should not be permitted to erupt. The community of nations faces formidable challenges regarding international security and the construction of the economic foundations of security. These tasks reflect the growing weight of North-South relationships, including their East-South component. The reactivation of growth in the developing countries and the reorientation of the economies of the new European democracies towards market rules are of paramount importance. The now defunct East-nest confrontation must not be superseded by a feud originating in tensions which are being bred by underdevelopment. In particular, the model of world trade must change: protectionism is wrong for consumers and, in the final analysis, is harmful for producers. The fragmentation of the world economy into rival blocs is of no advantage to anybody. The contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade must strive to reach a prompt and satisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round.\nThe success of the new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe is likely to constitute a useful example for some States of other continents to study and follow. Our success will lead to expanding market opportunities for the products of the South.\nThe experience of the Gulf conflict should lead to the consolidation of the Organization. First of all, we should maintain the effectiveness of the Security Council. He need an imaginative approach - peace-keeping operations\nshould be followed by peacemaking. While some provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter still await implementation, parallel means must be devised to allow the United Nations to prevent and discourage aggression, control arms build-ups and solve humanitarian and ecological problems resulting from armed conflict. The United Nations system no doubt needs reform in order to serve better the interests of Member States in a cost-effective manner. We support the concept of a unitary United Nations.\nThe consensus of the permanent members of the Security Council and their determination to discourage the threat or use of force are essential factors in creating a workable, post-cold-war international order. That order must, in the first place, be able to prevent conflicts. And when there has been a breach of the peace, the new order must provide for conflict and post-conflict management. The lesson of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is clear: we need more than mere deterrence.\nPoland agrees fully with the Secretary-General that there should be arrangements for alleviating the burdens incurred by countries which participate in economic measures against the offender State. Some of that State's economic partners may suffer considerably as a result of abiding by the decisions of the Organisation. It is clear that Article 50 of the Charter does not constitute a sufficient remedy. While that Article could be strengthened, another regulation dealing with a different aspect of security arrangements has long since become obsolete and should be deleted from the Charter. I refer here to Article 107 and the relevant part of Article 53. These provisions deal with the action - that is. Article 107, and, in particular, enforcement action - that is. Article 53, paragraph 1, to be taken \\\"in relation to any State which during the Second World War has been an enemy any signatory\\\" of the United Nations Charter. The category of \\\"enemy State\\\", which goes back to 1945, is no longer relevant in United Nations law end practice. These are anachronistic provisions which do not correspond to the legal and political reality of the Organisation, Article 107 is in Chapter XVII of the Charter, which describes its subject matter as \\\"transitional\\\". In fact, we have that transition behind us. I am convinced that there is consensus in the Assembly that these provisions should be struck out of the Charter and relegated to where they belong - that is, to history.\nIn this period of change, we should ask not only what this Organisation can do for us, but also what the Member States could and should do to turn the Organisation into an instrument of their dynamic policies in harmony with the Charter.\nInternational security begins with good relations with neighbors. The recent historical change in Polish-German relations is our common contribution to security in Europe and in the world. I pay a tribute to those Poles and Germans whose imagination and perseverance made this change possible and lasting.\nWe are doing our best to develop the creative process of interaction in Europe. New regional arrangements have a role to fulfill here: trilateral cooperation between Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary; Baltic cooperation; and the Hexagonale group. The functions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are essential and they are expanding. All this reflects the determination to build cooperative security in Europe.\nArmaments are a problem of our time. The limitation and monitoring of international arms transfers ought to be among the gears of conflict prevention and post-conflict management. He need an enhanced transparency in conventional arms transactions, especially in unstable and conflict-prone areas. Transparency would help to set up a kind of early warning system. Poland supports the initiative of the 12 member States of the European Community to establish a United Nations-administered register of conventional arms transfers. We are prepared to join in sponsoring an appropriate draft resolution.\nHowever, to be reliable the new international order must involve not only a check on the accumulation of arms; it must also stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of missile technology. An important step towards such a goal would be the prompt finalization of the convention on chemical weapons, and the enhancement of the effectiveness of the biological weapons convention. Hide adherence to the non-proliferation Treaty is of the utmost importance. He welcome the recent statements by France and China and some other nuclear-capable countries, including the Republic of South Africa, that they are willing to re-examine their attitude with respect to that Treaty. Experience resulting from the Gulf conflict indicates, in regard to the non-proliferation Treaty, that the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be further developed.\nThe Treaty on Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles and the strategic arms reduction Treaty (START) are big steps towards structuring global security. Recently there was a development of the utmost significance: 1 am referring to the disarmament initiatives announced on 27 September this year by the President of the United States of America. The changes effect the land, naval and air nuclear forces. This broad vision brings us closer to a much safer and better world order.\nI think that all would agree that global security can no longer be addressed in terms of one group of States or another. The developing world is spending 200 billion dollars annually on armaments. This is a share of the gross national product of those countries that is much higher than that of the developed States. The question is how to bring the \\\"peace dividend\\\" to bear on development needs.\nLet me make one particular point with regard to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. The changes within the Soviet Union must not endanger this Treaty. The process of its ratification and entry into force should be completed as soon as possible. Ratification of the Treaty in its present form has no bearing on, and especially does not restrict, the right of the Soviet republics to self-determination and independence. These are different issues that do not conflict with each other. Succession to the obligations resulting from the Treaty must take place with regard to all States emerging on Soviet territory. Strict implementation of the Treaty is of paramount importance to stability and security in Europe.\nNo world order is conceivable without the healing of the wounds of the Middle East. Poland pledges its support to a determined search for an equitable and enduring peace in the area. Such a peace is possible provided that the legitimate security interests of all countries and peoples of the region are safeguarded. A truly historic challenge and opportunity arise from the efforts to bring about, pursuant to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), a Middle East conference with United Nations participation. Such a conference would stand a better chance if antagonisms and mistrust were overcome. Nor should there be any room for false\naccusations. For these reasons Poland believes that the General Assembly should repeal resolution 3379 (XXX) of 10 November 1975 on Zionism. Let us add that the Solidarity movement in Poland and the new government have always been against that resolution. In the United Nations, its rescission has been long overdue. Consequently, Poland will join in sponsoring a draft resolution to this effect.\nThe Yugoslav crisis is cause for great concern. We fear that this crisis could have adverse consequences for European unity and for cooperation beyond Europe. Poland welcomes Security Council resolution 713 (1991) and will abide by it. In that resolution we see significant support for the steps that are being taken by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).\nI think that in the course of time, when the cease-fire is consolidated, there might be room for further peace initiatives regarding the Yugoslav crisis. After all the required conditions are met - and the consent of the parties figures prominently therein - the monitoring mission could be strengthened and other peace-keeping measures considered. Poland is ready to put its experience in that field at the disposal of the United Nations and of the competent European organisations. We are equally ready to participate in the mediation or conciliation process or other appropriate mechanisms. We welcome the recourse to arbitration.\nLet me add that the uses of peace-keeping in Europe may potentially have ramifications that will be wider than the Yugoslav conflict. Some areas of Europe are passing through a period of not always predictable transition. Yet Europe must remain a continent of peace, security and friendly cooperation. This broader perspective of peace-keeping and peace-management in Europe was recently envisaged by the President of the Republic of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mr. Lech Walesa, in his address to the Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia on 17 September 1991. This broader approach serves the aims of the United Nations and should enable us better to combine our peace efforts.\nLet me now turn to some of the global issues in fields other than the elimination of armed strife and the maintenance of military and political security.\nThe Economic and Social Council decided last May to authorize the Secretary-General to hold consultations with a view to convening a summit meeting on issues of social policies and development. We welcome this initiative as yet another manifestation of a departure from sterile, ideologically motivated disputes or. social issues in favor of the consideration of specific steps to strengthen the position of the individual and provide for better standards of life in greater freedom.\nThe importance of the Economic and Social Council initiatives derives also from the fact that, as the Human Development Report 1990 puts it, the lack of political commitment, not of financial resources, is often the real cause for human neglect.\nIn view of its past experience, Poland believes that economic development is inconceivable without its being firmly predicated on sound social development where the individual and his interests are overriding goals. We therefore welcome the preparations for the International Year of the Family, the broadest framework yet of an integrated approach to social questions at the United Nations. In line with the current trend in the Economic and Social Council, social and economic issues should be treated jointly, and this goes also for the world economic and social reports that are still being prepared separately.\nOne of the global challenges we face is the degradation of the environment. The success of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, will depend on the working out of specific programmes and cost estimates. Otherwise, there will be little chance for commitments on the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and on the modalities and procedures of such transfer. There is need for additional financial resources, and although estimates vary the amounts would be large by any standard. The new sources of funding might include, first, the conversion of a part of debts for ecological purposes and, secondly, users' fees and pollution charges. In any case, there must be predictability of resources to ensure the continuity of the flow of financial means. Those are some of the problems that should be carefully studied in preparing for the Conference.\nMay I add that the United Nations has a greater role to play in bringing help to victims of natural and man-made disasters.\nThe declaration by the General Assembly of a United Nations Decade of International Law should lead to an intellectual effort linked to coordination between various participants. The task, if taken seriously, is a tremendous one.\nAmong other initiatives, emphasis should be put on the implementation of international law in both the municipal and the intergovernmental spheres. There are various reasons why domestic application of international law by administrative organs and courts leaves much to be desired. There are a number of countries that would certainly benefit from more extensive and systematic information on the possible approaches to the problem of domestic implementation. But there is also room for improvement in some of the States where the rule of law is otherwise respected. Today there is such a massive influx of international law into the internal legal order of each State that the effectiveness of the process requires a very high level of expertise and very efficient functioning of the legislature, the executive and the courts. The Decade should be used to bring about progress in this field.\nThis is particularly important with regard to municipal implementation of international instruments on human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the protection of minorities. The Secretary-General deserves credit for stressing that\n\\\"the principle of non-interference with the essential domestic jurisdiction of States cannot be regarded as a protective barrier behind which human rights could be massively or systematically violated with\nIt should be made clear that the exception of domestic jurisdiction does not apply to any case where there is international regulation. Today, practically all the multifarious human rights and fundamental freedoms are subject to treaty or other obligations. Hence, their violation does not belong to the reserved domain of States, nor does individual or concerted action by Governments in defense of human rights constitute any interference or intervention in the internal affairs of the State.\nThe Decade of International Law should also draw our attention to the role of international tribunals. The recent frequent resort by States to the International Court of Justice is a positive development. The acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court should be encouraged. In particular, it would seem useful to study the possibility of extending the practice of States under the optional clause of the Statute of the International Court of \nJustice whereby States parties to a dispute would agree to go to the Court should the Security Council of the United Nations so recommend. I am referring to Article 36, paragraph 3, of the Charter and to Article 36 of the Court's Statute. Finally, because it entails flexibility and has other advantages, recourse to arbitration should be enhanced.\nAs our world becomes less and less divided, the role of law in strengthening the structure of international society becomes greater. Some say that there are situations in which there is a contradiction between national interest and the law of the Charter. That is not true, and our Organization is, I think, proving it. In the United Nations there is no alternative to cooperation and common action under the rule of law.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to convey to you, Sir, and to the other members of the Assembly, the greetings and good wishes of Sri Lanka's President, Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa. My President expresses the hope that the deliberations and decisions of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session will prove beneficial for the welfare of the peoples of the world.\nOn behalf of the delegation of Sri Lanka, let me congratulate Ambassador Sanir Shihabi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session.\nMe are meeting at a historic period in world affairs. Dramatic changes are occurring in many parts of the world. One year ago it would have been impossible to foresee, still less to forecast, what has taken place in the past several weeks. Relationships between nations are changing with breathtaking rapidity) old relationships are fading away, new relationships are emerging. Our President's friendly disposition, his diplomatic skills, his vast experience in the work of the United Nations are widely recognised. These qualities will no doubt stand us in good stead in our deliberations at this particularly important session.\nTo your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Malta, Professor Guido de Marco, we express our appreciation for the manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the Assembly's forty-fifth session. We are aware of his determined efforts towards the rationalisation and revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. We convey to him our best wishes for the years ahead.\nSeven new Member States, four from Asia and the Pacific region, have been admitted to the United Nations this year. We welcome accession of both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to full membership in the Organisation. May their membership in the United Nations result be in the fulfilment of the aspirations of their peoples.\nWe are glad that two Island States of the Pacific - the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia - have been admitted as Member States. We congratulate them and wish them wall. We are happy to welcome back to the community of nations the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania.\nThis world Organisation, founded in the aftermath of a world war, has more than trebled its membership since its inception. In 1945 its membership stood at 51. Today, 46 years later, it has risen to 166. In the intervening period, another world war has been averted. This is due, in no small measure, to the existence and the efforts of the United Nations and to the unremitting toil of all those who have laboured unceasingly to promote international peace and fellowship.\nThe United Nations is fortunate to have been served by a succession of distinguished Secretaries-General. Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar, during his 10 years in office, has shown courage and fortitude and a deep sense of commitment to the cause of peace and international understanding. His patient and quiet diplomacy has earned for him gratitude and appreciation worldwide. If the United Nations is now ready to move into a new era, much of the credit for sustaining it in the past decade would surely go to Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar.\nThe need for recourse to the United Nations on a number of occasions to seek solutions to problems of concern to the world community has resulted in renewed interest among Member States in the structures and procedures of the Organisation. There has been wide-ranging discussion on how the United Nations could be restructured and revitalised so as to make it more efficient in its functioning and more effective in the implementation of measures to secure peace and promote development.\nThe security and the development of a email country like Sri Lanka depends largely on the United Nations. Adherence by all Member States to the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual respect and equality, peaceful settlement of disputes and peaceful coexistence is fundamental. For a small country like Sri Lanka, what refuge is there other than the Charter of the United Nations?\nSri Lanka, in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations, is determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Despite a hostile external economic environment and a terrorist problem, we continue to maintain a relatively high index of development. Our economy is growing at over 6 per cent, inflation is being reduced, prices are stabilising, investments are increasing and so is production. We recognise the importance to development of the private sector. In the spheres of health care and education, we continue to provide services which have resulted in a reduction in infant and maternal mortality rates, an increased life expectancy and a further improvement in literacy.\nFor some years now Sri Lanka has suffered the trauma of civil strife. The Government of Sri Lanka has repeatedly affirmed its readiness for negotiations to resolve any grievances. Some of these grievances have already been solved. Others can, and must, be settled through negotiation. Whatever differences may exist among Sri Lankans, these differences can only be resolved by and among Sri Lankans through consultation, compromise and consensus.\nSri Lanka has a terrorist problem. The problem of terrorism is by no means peculiar to Sri Lanka. Attention has been focused by some on the human rights situation in our country. We make no attempt to conceal our problems; nor do we condone any violation of human rights. Sri Lanka is firmly committed to the observance of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Sights. We are a party to human rights Conventions. Sri Lanka reports to the United Nations bodies on human rights. Sri Lanka fulfils its obligations.\nAs to the process of development, the alleviation of poverty is a high priority on the agenda of development of the Government of Sri Lanka. It is pertinent to bear in mind that development cannot ignore cultural legacies rooted in history and firm traditional backgrounds. The harmonization of these cultural differences in welding together a national identity is important. We are striving for self-sustaining development aimed at improving living conditions while preserving cultural values derived from the religions and philosophies long cherished by our people.\nIn harmony with this concept of development, we have in Sri Lanka, under the leadership of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, a unique poverty alleviation programme, known locally as \\\"Janasaviya\\\" - which means \\\"the people's strength\\\". \\\"Janaaavlya\\\" is a development process based on human values. The family and the home are at the core of the efforts to implement this anti-poverty programme. As my President himself stated on the occasion of his inauguration on 2 January 1989:\n\\\"If we cannot help those who are deprived, we certainly cannot protect those who are privileged.\\\"\nSri Lanka's urban and rural housing programmes have been ballad internationally. It was on a proposal by President Premadasa that the United Nations observed the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless in 1987. Housing for all by the year 2000 is a goal that Sri Lanka is determined to achieve.\nThe ongoing international debate on environmental concerns and sustainable development has once again brought to the more the imperative of multilateralism and interdependence. In this context, the central role of the United Nations in the Conference on Environment and Development is necessary and appropriate. I do believe therefore that it is important that the General Assembly convey its views, clearly defined, to the relevant preparatory bodies so that viable and realistic proposals may be submitted to Rio de Janeiro.\nGlobal poverty, which is a common threat to the stability of national and international structures, is one of the major sources of environmental degradation. The persistence of appalling economic disparities between nations and within nations has no place in a new vision of the future world. Our one world cannot long endure part privileged, part deprived.\nFor over 40 years the world has been haunted by the spectre of a global nuclear war. However, the recent dramatic improvement in East-West relations is a markedly encouraging development in the quest for general and complete disarmament. We welcome the achievement of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range Missiles (INF Treaty) and the START Treaty and we look forward to further progress in the reduction and eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons.\nSri Lanka hopes that, with the acceptance of an intensified work programme in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, new substantive proposals which might form the basis of a consensus will be forthcoming to enable the adoption of the convention on chemical weapons by 1992. It is essential that the convention should retain its multilateral character in its implementation, and that it be non-discriminatory and supportive of international cooperation in economic and technological development for purposes not prohibited by the convention. In this light, Sri Lanka is actively considering becoming an original signatory to such a convention.\nSri Lanka welcomes in principle the initiative for the establishment of a register of international conventional arms transfers under the auspices of the United Nations. He are of the view that the recent conclusions reached and recommendations formulated by the United Nations group of experts on arms transfers would serve as a basis for further action in this field. The illicit trade in conventional arms is a cause for much concern. Such trade has provided arms to terrorists, drug traffickers, and other anti-social groups resulting in instability, suffering and destruction at the national, regional and international levels.\nIt was store than two decades ago, on the initiative of the 1970 non-aligned summit Conference in Lusaka, that Sri Lanka and Tanzania jointly presented a resolution to the United Nations on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. A Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly in 1971. An Ad Hoc Committee to implement this Declaration was appointed by the General Assembly in 1973. In 1979 the Conference of Littoral and Hinterland States, held in New York, adopted seven principles of agreement for the implementation of the Declaration. In 1980 the General Assembly requested the Ad Hoc Committee to engage in preparatory work for a conference on the Indian Ocean to be held in 1981. For a number of reasons the preparatory work of the Ad Hoc Committee could not be completed and the holding of the conference was delayed.\nActing on the renewed mandate of the General Assembly in resolution 45/77 of 12 December 1990, the Ad Hoc Committee held two sessions in April and July of this year. The Committee has completed the preparatory work to enable the convening of a Conference on the Indian Ocean in Colombo in 1992 in consultation with the host country, Sri Lanka.\nWe would welcome the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean in the proposed conference. Their cooperation would result in useful discussions to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.\nThe dramatic changes in international relations resulting from the ending of the cold war must necessarily extend to all regions of the world. If the rivalry between the great Powers has indeed ended, it must follow that the favourable developments in the international political scene enhancing peace, security and cooperation should have a positive impact on the Indian Ocean region as well.\nThe Charter of the United Nations provides specifically for regional arrangements for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action. Together with six other South Asian nations, Sri Lanka has the honour to belong to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which is making remarkable progress on several programmes of common interest. These are intended not only to enhance the living standards of the people of our region but also to contribute to world peace and progress. Sri Lanka has the honour and the distinction of hosting the sixth Summit Conference of SAARC in November of this year.\nWe welcome the trends towards the solution of a number of conflicts in different parts of the world in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation. In many of these conflicts the efforts of the United Nations and the Secretary-General have helped to bring about favourable developments. We urge the continuation of such efforts.\nThe preservation of Afghanistan's sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence is essential to a peaceful solution of the Afghanistan problem. We are confident that the five-point peace plan proposed by the Secretary-General would help to end this conflict soon. We are glad that the conflict in Cambodia has almost come to an end. Sri Lanka welcomes the recent peace agreement reached under the United Nations peace accord by the Phnom Penh Government and the three Cambodian guerrilla factions.\nWith regard to the situation in Cyprus, Sri Lanka appeals to all parties concerned to engage in meaningful discussions in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution. In this context, my delegation extends its fullest support and cooperation for an international conference under the guidance of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations should work towards the total eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic society guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all the people of South Africa.\nWe support all efforts to solve the problems associated with the violence and insecurity prevailing in the Middle Cast. We reiterate that a comprehensive solution to these problems is possible only with the restoration of the Inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. Only this can ensure the security of all States in the Middle East within secure and internationally recognised borders.\nWe stand on the threshold of an emerging international order. It is a matter for satisfaction and hope that all Member States are eager to participate in the endeavours of this Organisation recognising the central place of the United Nations in the international system.\nAs it nears the end of its fifth decade, the United Nations has won universal recognition for its untiring efforts in the promotion of global peace and development. It remains the only organisation which embraces all humankind. Nations and peoples who wish for, and are committed to, the amelioration of planet Earth have no other alternative. It is in this spirit, renewed and refreshed by encouraging recent developments, that we must continue the work entrusted to us in this Assembly. The opportunity for achievement is within our reach. Let it not once again slip from our grasp.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great pleasure for me to take this opportunity, now that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has become a Member of the United Nations, to explain the internal and external policies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its position on international affairs.\nFirst of all, may I extend my congratulations to Mr. Samir S. Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the current session and express my expectation that the General Assembly will achieve good results under his chairmanship.\nI should also like to express my gratitude to the Governments and representatives present here for the unanimous adoption of the resolution on the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations. I should like to affirm that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will discharge in good faith its duty as a Member State of the United Nations in conformity with the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nIt is an irreversible trend of the present time for all countries and nations to advance towards sovereignty, independence and peace, free from domination and subjugation. Therefore it is the task of all mankind to give a powerful impetus to this historic trend and build a free, peaceful new world. The United Nations serves as an important political forum for the carrying out of these current tasks, and thus the expectations of the world's people in regard to its role are growing dally.\nIt is regarded as necessary now to destroy the inequitable old international order, establish an equitable new one and effect the democratisation of international society so as to build the peaceful new world to which mankind aspires. A new international order should be established on the basis of the independent and equal rights of all countries and nations in the world, regardless of the size of their territories or their level of development. There can be large and small countries, developed and less developed nations in the world, but there must not be senior and junior countries, dominating nations and those destined to be dominated.\nAlthough my country is a small one, we strongly advocate greater independence and dignity. As an equal member of the international community, we will make active efforts to establish an equitable new international order which does not allow any privileges and arbitrariness in international relations. Today one cannot think about building a genuine new international order unless the gap between rich and poor, between the developed and the developing countries, which is growing wider with each passing day, is reduced.\nWe believe that the non-aligned countries, the developing countries, should consolidate and develop the Non-Aligned Movement into a force with more vitality, with a view to building a new international order, contributing to the cause of world peace and exercising the rights it has been granted. When the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement concert their efforts and promote friendship and cooperation in realising the principles and ideals of the Movement, the rehabilitation of countries and nations can be enhanced. The matter of relations with the developed countries can then be solved smoothly by promoting South-South cooperation. \nFurthermore, world peace can be firmly guaranteed only when a new international order is established and the gap between rich and poor, between North and South, is eliminated. Peace is the common desire of mankind. Today, the threat to peace comes from attempts to violate the independence of other countries and nations and to dominate others. To safeguard peace, every country and nation should maintain its independence, oppose power politics and engage in powerful, joint international action to prevent war.\nThe most pressing issue involved in ensuring a durable peace in the world is to effect arms reduction and abolish nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. As a nation exposed to continual nuclear threat, the Korean people have put forward the abolition of nuclear weapons as an urgent demand related to our national destiny. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regards the achievement of a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing within a short period of time as one of the most pressing tasks in the field of disarmament today. It will actively join the international community in its endeavours to prevent the testing and production of nuclear weapons, to reduce nuclear weapons and, eventually, to abolish all nuclear weapons.\nThe completion and conclusion of the global convention on chemical weapons is an important step in eliminating weapons of mass destruction. In keeping with our goal of comprehensive disarmament we support the idea of a ban on chemical weapons and will exert our efforts to make this convention an equitable, comprehensive and complete international legislative instrument.\nThe Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea holds that, if the world is to become peaceful and stable, both disputes between countries and nations and regional disputes and disturbances should first be settled. In the settling of all disputes account should be taken of the interests of the parties concerned and the cause of peace. Recently the United Nations has exerted considerable effort in coordinating disputes and has achieved some progress. We express our support for all endeavours to settle regional disputes through dialogue and negotiation and through political coordination. It is our position that all acts of infringement on the sovereignty of other countries, all interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and the establishment of unfair blockades and pressures should be ended immediately, and we support the just struggles of all peoples opposing such interventionist policies.\nToday, when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has formally entered the United Nations, my country's Government expects that the remnants of the pact relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United Nations prior to the country's admission to membership of the Organisation will be completely eradicated and that the United Nations will make a due contribution to the fair solution of the question of Korea's reunification.\nOriginally, Korea was a homogenous nation that existed for thousands of years in one land with the same language and sharing the same blood. The division of Korea was not brought about by contradictions within our nation; rather it was imposed upon us by foreign forces.\nToday, the question of Korean reunification has become not only a vital question related to the destiny of our nation, but also a pressing problem, the solution to which is directly linked with the peace of Asia and the rest of the world.\nOver the prolonged period of division in Korea, different systems have been established in the north and in the south. In the northern part of Korea, a man-centred socialist system, the embodiment of the Juche idea, has firmly taken root. Our socialism is neither imported from, nor a replica of, that in any foreign country. It is a unique socialism, which our people have chosen by themselves in keeping with the realities of our country, one which continues to grow stronger and to develop through the efforts of our people themselves.\nIn our country, the leader, the party and the popular masses are united and of one mind, and the entire people are iron strong in their faith and determination to defend our socialism. Therefore, our socialism will not be swayed, no matter in what direction the wind blows, and it will continue to stay firmly on its course.\nThere may be some temporary frustrations and twists and turns in the course of history's advance, but it is an inviolable law that mankind heads for the road to independence. The question is how firmly to rely on the popular masses, how highly to respect their will and how to represent their interests. It is our firm position that the question of the country's reunification must be resolved in conformity with the will and interests of our people.\nIt is from that standpoint that we consistently call for reunification by bringing down the barriers of division and attaining the greater unity of the nation. He cannot understand why there has been silence about the concrete wall built in the southern area of the Military Demarcation Line as the symbol of Korea's division and confrontation, while at the same time there has been\nacclaim for the demolition of the Berlin Wall and the crumbling of the barrier of the East-West cold war. We have already proposed the demolition of the concrete wall in the southern area of the Military Demarcation Line and free travel and a full opening up in all areas of politics, economy and culture. This is a powerful way to achieve national reconciliation and unity and to realise the country's reunification.\nIn the south of Korea there persists another system quite different from ours. We believe that, to resolve the question of reunification, the reality in our country should be the starting-point from which we must find a way that meets the specific conditions that exist in our country. If the stark realities existing in north and south are disregarded and reunification through unification of the systems is advocated, it will inevitably increase mistrust and confrontation, not reunification, and will lead, furthermore, to the recurrence of the national scourge of conflict and fratricidal war.\nTherefore we hold that Korea's reunification should be based on reunification of the nation - that is, uniting the North and the South as one nation - and not on unification of the systems through one side conquering or being conquered by the other. As the most realistic means of achieving this solution, our Government has proposed accomplishing reunification through a confederation based on one nation and one State, but two systems and two Governments. As a concrete means of achieving confederal reunification, we have proposed the establishment of a Democratic Confederal Republic of Korea.\nFurthermore, for the purpose of facilitating nationwide agreement, we have expressed our willingness to hold negotiations on our proposal that, in the interim, the regional autonomous Governments of the confederal Republic be vested with more powers and, in due course, the functioning of the central Government upgraded so that full reunification, in the form of a confederation, may be achieved eventually.\nWe believe that confederal reunification is the most realistic and peace-loving way, as it rules out both the prevalence of Communism and communisation, on the one hand, and a northward or a southward invasion, on the other. This proposal accords with the noble purpose of the United Nations, whose mission is to safeguard peace and justice in international relations.\nOur people have excellent traditions and experience to draw on. We have in the past achieved unity for the sake of the common cause of the nation, transcending differences in ideologies, ideals, political viewpoints and religious beliefs. When the entire people in the north and the south of Korea and overseas compatriots renew the tradition of national unity, when they work together for the great unity of the nation, they will definitely realise the national priority of the task of reunification.\nWe regard North-South dialogue as the main means of peaceful reunification. He desire progress in the high-level North-South talks, to pave the way for the peaceful reunification of Korea. If the high-level North-South talks come to a fruitful conclusion, talks at the highest level will be feasible. The North-South dialogue must be a dialogue for reunification, net for division. The reunification of the country is a nationwide cause, which cannot be achieved simply by a special stratum of the North or the South. All parties and organisations and people of all sectors who desire national reunification should harmonise their demands and actions for the purpose of achieving solidarity and unity.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposes that a political consultative conference for national reunification be convened, possibly at an early date. Representatives of the Governments and of political parties and organisations in the North and in the South would participate, with a view to achieving nationwide agreement on the ways and means of reunification.\nAlthough the north and the south of Korea have joined the United Nations separately, our position on national reunification is unchanged. Our people will actively strive to attain national reunification and thus unity of the whole nation, to bring closer the day when the reunified Korea will take one seat at the United Nations and contribute to the common cause of mankind. If a peaceful solution of the question of our national reunification is to be secured, the first and foremost task is to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula and to satisfy the prerequisites for peaceful reunification. We regard the adoption of the proposed North-South non-aggression declaration as the starting-point for removal of the military confrontation on the Korean peninsula and for a fundamental improvement in North-South relations.\nOn the Korean peninsula there stand, confronting one another across the military demarcation line, a million armed forces on full alert. The acute military confrontation on the Korean peninsula constitutes the main factor that spawns mistrust and misunderstanding between the North and the South. So long as the North and the South have their guns levelled at each other and keep daggers in their pockets, the situation will never be eased, and the tension on the Korean peninsula will not be removed.\nWe have long proposed the adoption of a non-aggression declaration between the North and the South as a direct step towards defusing the acute confrontation. If the non-aggression declaration is adopted it will help to open a decisive phase in replacing the unstable cease-fire system with a system of durable peace on the Korean peninsula and in easing the confrontation between the North and the South. We have proposed arms reductions in the North and the South, along with the adoption of the non-aggression declaration, with a view to ending military confrontation. Otherwise it will be impossible either to promote trust or to have a negotiated solution of the question of peaceful reunification between the north and the south of the Korean peninsula, where tension and the danger of war have reached a climax.\nOur Government has already advanced comprehensive arms-reduction proposals for the Korean peninsula. He hold that the North and the South should suspend all joint Military exercises with foreign forces and other large-scale military exercises in order to create an atmosphere of trust; should turn the demilitarised zone along the military demarcation line into a peace zone and enable it to be used for peaceful purposes; and should take security measures to prevent any accidental conflict that could lead to escalation.\nWe hold that, for the purpose of removing military confrontation, the North and the South should phase down their armed forces to fewer than 100,000 each within a period of three or four years; dissolve all civilian military organisations and civilian forces; cease the introduction of new military technological equipment and the development of armaments; and hold on-the-spot inspection to verify the implementation of arms-reduction measures.\nThe Government of our Republic has not only advanced a peace-oriented proposal for arms reduction but also taken the initiative of demobilising a large number of its armed forces. To our regret, however, our peace initiatives remain unilateral efforts; reciprocal steps have not followed. We believe that if the North and the South agree upon the idea of arms reduction, and embark on the process, the danger of armed conflict and war on the Korean peninsula will be removed, distrust between the North and the South dispelled, and a favourable environment for peaceful reunification created.\nSince the north and the south of Korea have both joined the United Nations we consider it necessary now to take measures to dissolve the \\\"United Nations command\\\" presence in South Korea, to have the \\\"United Nations forces\\\" withdrawn, and to replace the Korean armistice agreement with a peace agreement.\nFor a durable peace in Korea, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Korean peninsula now appears to be a realistic possibility. Out of our desire to eliminate the danger of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and to contribute to durable peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world, we have put forward a proposal to turn the Korean peninsula into a zone free of nuclear weapons. Last July, the Government of the Republic put forward a new proposal, according to which the north and the south of Korea would agree on and jointly declare a nuclear-weapon-free zone on the Korean peninsula; the United States, the Soviet Union and China - the nuclear-weapon States neighbouring the Korean peninsula - would legally guarantee the nuclear-weapon-free status of the Korean peninsula once an agreement had been reached and a declaration adopted to this effect; and the non-nuclear-weapon States in Asia would support the conversion of the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and respect its nuclear-weapon-free status. Our new proposal has been welcomed by the nuclear-weapon States and the parties concerned.\nWe consider it necessary for the north and the south of Korea to pledge themselves before the world to a ban on the testing, manufacture and possession of nuclear weapons and to a prohibition on the deployment or transit of nuclear weapons and on nuclear military exercises on their territory. If the north and the south of Korea jointly declare the Korean peninsula to be a nuclear-weapon-free zone and the nuclear-weapon States neighbouring the Korean peninsula legally guarantee its nuclear-weapon-free status, the danger of nuclear war in Korea would undoubtedly be removed once and for all and the establishment of a durable peace would be assisted.\nWith all clarity we reiterate that we have no intention of developing nuclear weapons, nor do we have the capability of so doing. The matter of nuclear inspections in our country cannot be resolved in isolation from the particular environment prevailing there: we expected that, as a matter of course, once our country adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the nuclear threat against us would be removed. The reality, however, is quite contrary to our expectations, and we remain exposed to an ever-increasing nuclear threat. The military exercises known as \\\"Team Spirit\\\", which are staged annually south of the military demarcation line, are in fact a nuclear-war exercise targeted against us.\nOurs is the only country in the world of the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that is faced directly with a nuclear threat. That being the case, the matter of removing the nuclear threat is for us a vital question relating to our nation's right to survival.\nAccording to the Treaty, the nuclear-weapon States commit themselves not to threaten the non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the Treaty. However, the problem cannot be resolved so long as the non-fulfilment of its Treaty obligation by the nuclear-weapon State which is now imposing a nuclear threat upon us is disregarded while at the same time we are being urged to agree to unilateral nuclear inspections even as we are exposed to nuclear threat.\nThe failure to conclude the nuclear safeguards agreement at the September meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency may also be attributed to the \\\"adoption\\\" of the \\\"resolution\\\" intended to apply international pressure upon us, which is tantamount to interference in our internal affairs. It is our position that it is difficult to resolve the problem so long as the nuclear threat against us continues and the one-aided international pressure on us persists.\nWe welcome the announcement by President Bush that the United States will eliminate short-range nuclear weapons based on land and at sea, and hope that his proposal will be implemented as soon as possible. It is our expectation, in the light of this plan, that nuclear weapons in South Korea will be eliminated. If the United States does indeed withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea, the road will be open for us to conclude a nuclear safeguards agreement.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a peace-loving country, and the Korean people value peace highly. The Government of our Republic and our people will make every possible effort to ensure peace in Korea and to defend world peace, the common cause of mankind.\nWe are convinced that our national desire to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula and to achieve its independent and peaceful reunification will enjoy the support and sympathy of the States Members of the United nations.\nIndependence, peace and friendship are the principal ideals of the foreign policy followed by the Government of our Republic. On the basis of these ideals, we shall promote friendship and unity with all the countries of the international community and shall make an active contribution to the cause of the United Nations for world peace and security, and shall do our utmost for the sound development of international relations and the further expansion and development of relations of friendship and cooperation between nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to convey to Ambassador Shihabi and, through him, to all members the warm greetings of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, and his good wishes for the success of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nLet me take this opportunity to extend to Ambassador Shihabi the warm congratulations of my delegation on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Given his wisdom and experience, I am confident that he will guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I should like also to put on record our appreciation of the skilful manner in which Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta conducted the proceedings of our last session.\nIt is with great sadness that we mark the end of our eminent Secretary-General's tenure. For 10 years all of us have been the beneficiaries of his inspired leadership and masterful diplomacy. His record is a long and unblemished list of brilliant achievements. Oftentimes his personal intervention has made the crucial difference towards creating favourable conditions for negotiation and effecting a breakthrough in a conflict. Most important, he has presided over an enhanced, reinvigorated United Nations, to which the world has in recent years increasingly looked for the solution of its problems. His sense of mission has indeed been unfailing. Our sincere appreciation and gratitude go to him for such remarkable dedication and service.\nThe Secretary-General's annual report is an illustration of this dedication. It is not merely a reprise of recent events but a blueprint for the present and future and a call to action. His recommendations deserve our utmost attention.\nI wish to extend a warm welcome to the Government and peoples of the Republic of Korea and of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on their long-overdue admission to the United Nations. Another vestige of the cold war has been shed. The admission of these countries, we believe, will give further momentum to the process of reunification that both countries desire. In this context, we fully support the three measures proposed by President Roh Tae Woo of the Republic of Korea, in his recent address to the General Assembly, for the building of a positive relationship on the foundation of the new phase of coexistence between the two Koreas.\nThe dawning of the new era also sees the admission of the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania to the United Nations. Following so rapidly in the wake of their independence, their membership is eloquent testimony to the love of freedom of their peoples and to the advancement of a more fully representative world body. We also extend a cordial welcome to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands on their admission to the United Nations. The world community can only benefit from this greater diversity.\nWe are living in extraordinary times. So much has happened so quickly that it is difficult to keep up with world events. With the end of the cold war, understanding, cooperation and an irreversible trend towards reconciliation between nations have prevailed. Old conflicts are ended; new opportunities and fresh thinking are evolving. What was once unthinkable has become a reality. Happily, Germany has become one nation again. And more changes occur daily, The transformation of the Soviet Onion is nothing less than amazing. After centuries of autocratic rule, the people are now arbiters of their own destiny. There is much uncertainty, and there are many variables, as at any turning-point in history; yet we cannot but see these changes as a happy augury for the whole world. As ideological conflicts are shelved, convergence of views becomes possible on critical points. The work of the United Nations is enhanced, strengthened and revitalised. There is greater willingness to work through the United Nations system. Such willingness made possible a swift, concerted response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and helped effect the liberation of the Emirate. As our Secretary-General has aptly pointed out,\n\\\"The United Nations, therefore, enters the post-cold-war era as a central point of constancy in the midst of flux.\\\" (A/45/1, p. 2) In the process, renewed respect for the rule of law has been established. This opens opportunities for the resolution of conflicts and paves the way for a new international order of peace and stability. The totality of the Charter thereby comes into full force. A world upholding the primacy of the rule of law turns its back on barbarism and self-destruction. We believe this marks an important step in the evolution of the political consciousness of mankind.\nMeanwhile, however, some regional conflicts drag on, old wounds fester, and new conflicts arise. Any one of these could turn into a general conflagration. Even in some areas where cease-fires have been arranged the peace remains precarious. Clearly, much remains to be done.\nOn the one hand, the liberation of Kuwait was a just victory for the rule of law and for the United Nations system. The country's sovereignty was restored under its rightful ruler. His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, a statesman of great wisdom and vision. This demonstrated that the sovereignty of all countries, large or small, is to be respected. Yet the war also left many problems in its wake. Hundreds of oil wells continue to burn out of control in Kuwait, spewing pollution into the atmosphere and blanketing much of that country in darkness. Oil slicks poison the Persian Gulf. The social and economic infrastructures have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people suffered at the hands of the aggressor.\nThe war threw into stark relief the problems of the Middle East as a whole, and set off warning bells that a comprehensive solution must be found. The plight of the Palestinians remains the crux of the problem. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) must be implemented, and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians granted, foremost among them being the right to self-determination, including the right to national self-determination in their homeland. A new momentum for peace is now under way. The region is poised on the threshold of a historic breakthrough for peace. We applaud the latest peace efforts of the United States to convene an international conference, which alone can bring about the resolution of this complex problem. We support the security and the right to exist in safety of all States in the area, including Israel.\nMy delegation is also encouraged by the events in Lebanon. At long last, after a brutal civil war that for 16 years tore the country apart, a fledgling peace is in place. We ardently hope that the suffering of the people is finally at an end, that the peace holds, and that the sovereignty and viability of the nation are firmly anchored.\nLooking to southern Africa, the independence of Namibia in March 1990 marked the successful culmination of long years of patient United Nations effort. The result has been a happy one, not only for Namibia but for much of the region as well. It is a harbinger of things to come within South Africa itself. Sadly, peace is still not a reality in Afghanistan. War, fuelled and maintained by outside interests, continues to ravage the country. Refugees have left by the hundreds of thousands. The country remains desperately poor. We call for an end to outside interference, for an end to the fighting, and for the establishment of a political process that will enable the Afghan people to exercise their right of self-determination and form a broad-based Government enjoying the confidence of the majority.\nA lasting solution to the Cambodian problem may be at hand. The process began with the five permanent members of the Security Council working for a comprehensive solution and the invaluable work of the Association of South-East Asian Rations (ASEAN) to get the parties to the conflict to negotiate. The situation is now entering a decisive stage with the Pattaya agreement, under which the Cambodian Government and rebel groups will disband 70 per cent of their military forces and put the rest under the supervision of the United Nations. This marks a turning-point. The formation of the Cambodian Supreme National Council was another major breakthrough. The initiatives resulting from the Paris Conference of last December kept dialogue going and laid the groundwork for the current agreement. Now at last the parties appear to be working toward the ultimate goal - the restoration of the country's independence and territorial integrity under a truly representative government. We welcome these developments and we wish the people of Cambodia well in their efforts to build a new future for themselves. Overarching such regional problems and uncertainties are those issues that are global in scope.\nDisarmament is our greatest challenge today. The signing of the strategic arms reduction Treaty in July this year marked another important step on the road to disarmament. Yet large stockpiles of weapons remain. We must press for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. In this context, we welcome the recent proposal of President George Bush for the elimination of all tactical nuclear weapons on land and at sea in Europe and Asia. Furthermore, we believe that priority must be given to a truly comprehensive test-ban treaty. The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons therefore deserves a high place on the agenda as well. Nuclear weapons are not the only danger. Chemical and bacteriological weapons pose serious threats. We call for a fourth special session on disarmament to address these issues and to forge concrete steps for the creation of a nuclear-free world.\nA psychology of peace must replace the psychology of war. In so doing we opt for a saner and more secure world.\nSadly, the expected peace dividend has not translated into greater benefits for the developing nations nor a more equitable international economic order. A burgeoning arms trade continues unhindered, distorting priorities and gobbling up a staggering one fifth of the national budgets in many countries. Thus a vicious cycle of poverty, instability and cruel social conditions is perpetuated. The old, rusty machinery powered by the unjust system of economic relations lumbers on, but with a difference - the status quo is not maintained; rather, we see a steady drop in living standards for the vast majority of mankind. Overall, there has been a dramatic increase in poverty, disease, and deprivation. the past 10 years especially have taken their toll. For many of the developing countries, growth and development have been replaced by stagnation and decline. The reasons for this are hydra-headed and complex, but include, among other factors, depressed commodity prices, an increasing debt-servicing burden, and under-funded structural adjustment programmes, on the one hand, and unfair terms of trade, restricted access of goods and an increase in taxes and higher interest rates, on the other. The ongoing Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations must address these problems. The further liberalisation of trade by the removal of protectionist barriers and the institution of more remunerative commodity prices would be a good start. So too would the emplacement of a more stable exchange rate system.\nThe Economic and Social Council has an invaluable part to play. In this context we fully support the excellent recommendations of the resumed forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, on the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields. The resulting restructuring and revitalization of the Economic and Social Council will we believe enhance its impact and effectiveness.\nThe North-South dialogue must be increased and must continue, with the ultimate goal of bridging the gap between rich and poor nations. South-South cooperation, most recently affirmed and strengthened at the ministerial meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries held in Accra, has been of immeasurable assistance to the developing countries. We are building the foundation of what we hope will embrace a world-wide network of creative partnerships and associations of mutual advantage. We are working towards dynamic relationships making optimal use of the world's resources, skills and technology. This is we believe our best hope for global peace and stability. Above all it is workable and practical, a demonstrable application of enlightened self-interest.\nA necessary corollary is the responsible stewardship of the world's resources. We are far from this goal. Indeed, every day brings alarming evidence of the diminishing capacity of the planet to sustain life. Ominous signs of the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer include climatic changes and an increase in certain health problems. Air and water pollution, soil degradation, desertification and deforestation threaten the world's food supplies and living conditions. Overpopulation puts further strains and pressures on the environment. The picture would be unbelievably bleak but for some eleventh-hour attempts at our salvation.\nThe Montreal Protocol on ozone depletion represents a serious effort to restore our planet to ecological health. Clearly, however, we need to go much further. The environment is our primary source of life and as such requires our urgent consideration. We have expectations that the Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Bio de Janeiro in June next year, will adopt a concerted and comprehensive programme to tackle all of the major environmental problems and issues. He hope the opportunity provided by this Conference will be fully utilised to deal with the question of environment and development on an integrated basis.\nIn my own country, Bhutan, our development goes hand in hand with unfailing concern for and sensitivity to the environment. He take pride in the fact that environmental concerns have been merged in economic decision-making. At the same time, our economic infrastructure remains inadequate and the country's communications and transportation systems are still nascent. In addition to sharing the problems of many other least developed countries, Bhutan is handicapped by being land-locked. Outside assistance is therefore crucial to our development. Here I should like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of our development partners, particularly India, Japan, Kuwait, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Norway, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany, and the various specialised agencies and bodies of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICBF), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Volunteers (UNV), the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations Department of Technical Cooperation for Development (UNDTCD), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), in helping us to reach our development goals. Through their assistance we are working steadily towards self-reliance.\nI might add that we in Bhutan are hopeful about the Programme of Action adopted during the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, in Paris last September. After only a year it is perhaps too early to assess its impact. Yet we are optimistic that the implementation of the Programme of Action will accelerate economic growth and alleviate the sufferings of the people in the least developed countries.\nAfter two world wars and innumerable conflicts that have taken an appalling toll, the darker side of humanity might seem to have eclipsed the exuberant hopes of an earlier age. Yet this is not so. The United Nations, revived and strengthened and the repository of more of the world's hopes and dreams than at any time since its founding, is proof that we believe in the future, that we invest in it. As we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century, we have much to celebrate - as well as many challenges to meet. The post-cold-war era presents us with myriad opportunities. Let us seize the day and fulfil the promise of the new age.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to express, on behalf of my country and on my own behalf, my wholehearted congratulations upon your election as President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The strong bonds of brotherhood and close cooperation that exist between Tunisia and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia make us additionally proud of this appropriate choice, which is an expression of the high regard in which the international community holds your brotherly country, which has done its utmost for cooperation among nations. It is, at the same time, a tribute to your knowledge and wisdom, qualities that will be, God willing, of great assistance to us in attaining positive results during this session.\nI am also pleased to join other speakers in extending to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, our deepest appreciation for his great services and high competence during his presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I should also like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt regards and respect to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuallar, who for 10 years has shouldered the responsibility of the Secretariat of the Organisation during one of the most difficult periods ever experienced by the international community. Mow that he is getting ready to bring to completion his task at the head of the world Organisation, Tunisia would like to assure him of its deep appreciation for his important and tireless efforts on behalf of peace and cooperation among nations.\nWe also welcome the new Members of our Organization: the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Tunisia views the accession to the membership of the United Nations by the three Baltic Republics as yet another indication of the profound changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union on the basis of respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and adherence to international legality. Such changes could have never taken place were it not for the policy of perestroika pursued by President Mikhail Gorbachev since he assumed the highest post in his country. We are convinced that the Soviet Union will continue to play its constructive role in the service of peace and security in the world.\nOn the threshold of a new century, the international community is entering upon a delicate and difficult phase characterized principally by the painstaking search for ways and means of establishing a new and more equitable world order in which will prevail the lofty values of solidarity among human beings and stability, peace and security for mankind in keeping with the principles of equality and justice. Tunisia, being a peace-loving country that is devoted to the United Nations Charter and its principles and a country that upholds the right of all peoples to live in dignity, has always done its utmost to implement those noble principles both at the national and international levels. I should like to inform the Assembly of some of Tunisia's contributions in this connection since the last session of the General Assembly.\nAt the national level, Tunisia has continued to strengthen its achievements in building a new society in which human rights will be protected, the principles of freedom, democracy and political plurality will flourish, and the rule of law will prevail. Having become aware early on of the demands of our times, and determined to meet those demands, since the changes that took place on 7 November 1987 Tunisia has declared its commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. It has undertaken to create the conditions necessary to protect those rights. President Ben Ali's decision in January 1991 to establish the High Commission on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was further confirmation of our firm commitment in that regard.\nWe would like to emphasize from this rostrum that this democratic policy is a key change in my country. Without any reservations, Tunisia has ratified the United Nations Convention against torture and was honoured to be chosen to host the Arab Institute for Human Rights. We have also authorized Amnesty International to open an office in Tunisia. Tunisia, which has always condemned all forms of discrimination on the basis of race, faith or gender, and which is a signatory of various United Nations conventions relating to human rights, wishes at this time to reaffirm its determination to work tirelessly in order to enrich its legislation and strengthen its institutions concerned with the protection of the citizen's rights and freedoms in every field.\nWe would like to reaffirm in this connection that our country, which aspires after an open and tolerant society, unambiguously rejects extremism in every shape and form, as we believe that extremism and its attendant bigotries and violence are the worst enemies of human rights, including the right to a secure life and freedom of thought. He sincerely hope that the international community will take note of this, so that we may fight together against this dangerous phenomenon which threatens the very stability of our societies and which finds support and encouragement from certain parties. The international community must militate against such criminal activities.\nWhile progress in any society hinges upon the level of that society's internal stability and peace, we believe that it equally depends on the external environment in international relations as a whole. Hence Tunisia, which strives to ensure social peace and stability so that it may be able to mobilize its resources for its own development, gives a very high priority to the establishment of world peace.\nThis became obvious in Tunisia's position vis-\u00e0-vis the Gulf crisis. While it supported Security Council resolutions and implemented them in full - despite their serious and ongoing negative impact on our economy - it did its utmost to avoid the war and subsequently to end it. We would like to express our deep regret at the crisis, and we hope that the international community will work together in order to eliminate the remaining effects of the war so that stability and peace might be restored in the area on the basis of full respect for international legality.\nIn this respect, while affirming our unswerving devotion to international legality and our continuing support for the role of the United Nations in solving world problems, we call upon the international community to take cognisance, for strictly humanitarian reasons, of the suffering of large sectors of the Iraqi people, particularly new-born infants and the elderly, who are adversely affected and suffer under nourishment and a lack of basic health care.\nThe same humanitarian considerations, as well as our sincere desire to look beyond this painful past, make us follow closely the question of the Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq. We strongly hope that this question will be solved in a way that would ensure the return of those prisoners to their families as soon as possible, thus allowing the Iraqi and Kuwaiti peoples to open a new era in their relations based on good-neighbourliness and a forward-looking attitude characterized by trust, peace and brotherhood. Tunisia, which has supported United Nations peace efforts in various parts of the world by contributing troops to the United Nations missions to the Congo in the 1960s and, more recently, to Namibia, wishes today to reaffirm its commitment to Arab and international efforts to re-establish peace and stability in the Gulf and in all other areas of tension in the world.\nMy country's devotion to peace is seen also in our ongoing efforts to contribute to the resolution of the Palestinian problem, which remains the core issue in the Middle East conflict. As we firmly support the right of Palestinians freely to make their own decisions, we have encouraged the approach of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) since its declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988, an approach that relies on negotiations as a means of resolving the Palestinian problem.\nMy country, which hosted the beginnings of the Palestinian-United States dialogue and worked for its success, welcomes today United States and international efforts to convene a peace conference in the Middle East and the positive attitude of the Palestine National Council towards that conference. We reaffirm our readiness to participate in the peace process in the framework of the efforts of the Arab Maghreb Union countries, in such a way as to strengthen our Palestinian brothers and help preserve legitimate Palestinian and Arab rights.\nIn this respect, we do hope to witness a clearer and more firm determination on the part of the international community to impose peace on all those who create obstacles to peace. While we draw attention to the dangerous consequences of allowing Israel to continue to defy General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on this issue, to pursue its violent acts of repression against the civilian population and to continue its colonization policies aimed at imposing a fait accompli, we wish to state that it is our conviction that there can be no just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless all parties concerned, including the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people, participate in the peace process and unless the goal of the process is to recognise all legitimate Palestinian rights and to secure Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, including the Holy City of Al-Quds.\nThere is no doubt that a major prerequisite of success in Middle East peace efforts is confidence-building among all parties concerned, both before and during the negotiations. We believe, therefore, that the international community should demand that Israel adopt an approach that bespeaks a real desire to go ahead with the peace process, instead of persisting in acts that further complicate a peace process which calls for responsible behaviour, not arrogance and rejection.\nIn that context, the policy of settlements in the occupied Arab territories, including Al-Quds, a policy Israel relentlessly pursues and even accelerates, is an obstacle to real, equitable peace. The international community should wonder whether Israel's desire for peace is genuine. If Israel wants to demonstrate such a genuine will for peace, it should end its policy of settlements, deportations and repression. That would make mutual trust possible among the parties to the conflict, which could help create a new relationship between Arabs and Israelis. That could, in turn, lead to a new stance on the boycott question, and could accelerate the peace process among all parties concerned.\nA just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict places a heavy burden of responsibility on the United\nNations. We are sure the Organisation can shoulder that burden, thereby strengthening its position, increasing its credibility and convincing all Members that United Nations decisions must be implemented. Success in this would undoubtedly enhance the Organisation's effectiveness in dealing with other pending issues such as those relating to Cyprus, southern Lebanon, Kashmir and Cambodia, both through ongoing United Nations efforts and through the endeavours of humanitarian organisations whose purpose is to alleviate the suffering of people in those areas.\nIn that context, we express our satisfaction at the positive developments taking place in various crisis areas, where dialogue and reconciliation are prevailing over violence and anarchy.\nWe are pleased at the great progress made by brotherly Lebanon towards national unity and stability thanks to the implementation of the Taif agreement, which saved the country from a perilous situation. We wish the Lebanese State full success in building a new peaceful, independent and prosperous Lebanon.\nWe also support attempts to restore harmony and understanding in Yugoslavia, a friendly country with which we have longstanding relations of cooperation and mutual respect.\nWe welcome progress towards solving the Cambodian problem. The agreement signed last July at Beijing opens new prospects for restoring peace in the area and for creating a climate of reconciliation and understanding among all Cambodians. This gives them the chance to build a new independent and democratic Cambodia free from foreign intervention. We take this opportunity to convey our friendly greetings to the delegation present in this Hall representing the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, and to its Chairman, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\nTurning to Afghanistan, my delegation hopes that the Secretary-General's five-point plan of May 1991 will put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people, especially since the agreement has been accepted by all the parties concerned in that country. We believe the talks that began on the basis of that plan should continue with support from the international community in order speedily to reach a final solution to this long-standing problem. In that connection, we welcome the joint decision by the Soviet Union and the United States of America to halt all deliveries of weapons to the parties to the conflict. That constitutes a decisive step forward that will unquestionably help stop the bloodshed. The positive decision I have just mentioned reminds us once again of the essential role disarmament could play in reducing tension in many parts of the world.\nThe armed conflicts witnessed in the Gulf area and the Middle East and the persistence of unresolved problems show that peace and security are still threatened, and that in searching for a better future today's world must consider disarmament as one of its main objectives until a real reduction of all kinds of arms is achieved. Tunisia, which has always striven to make the Mediterranean a lake of peace and cooperation, notes with interest the efforts made here to achieve disarmament in the Middle East. We hope that such efforts will be carried out in a spirit of justice, and that they will cover all countries of the region and all types of armaments, in order to avoid aggravating the present imbalance, and will thus contribute to the ongoing disarmament process which has started to achieve some encouraging successes in other parts of the world. Indeed, we have witnessed a number of positive steps taken in that direction in the span of one year.\nWe welcome the important decision announced by President Bush on 27 September on reducing various types of short-range nuclear weapons and other weapons currently deployed on land, at sea and in the air. We hope that this decision will be followed by similar measures by the other nuclear Powers. Moreover, multilateral negotiations on chemical weapons are about to be concluded, and a number of countries have expressed their readiness to become parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty on nuclear weapons.\nWe also note with satisfaction positive signs in the reduction of defence budgets in favour of development and the environment, as well as the destruction of some existing weapons and the setting up of an effective mechanism for monitoring and on-the-spot inspection.\nWhile these developments are undoubtedly positive, we must all recognise that the gap between resources spent on armaments and those used for development Is still extremely wide and that the existence of huge arsenals all over the world remains a cause of deep concern. That is why we find it useful to consider the proposal for establishing, under the authority of the United Nations, a system for control of the proliferation, production and transfer of all types of weapons.\nThe establishment of world peace, as well as the strengthening of peace, security and stability the world over, is certainly a necessary condition for the progress and prosperity of mankind. But in our view this would not be enough. There must also be real cooperation between countries, especially at the regional level. Tunisia has been in the forefront of those contributing to this by helping establish the Arab Maghreb Union and ensuring its joint progress towards the attainment of our development expectations.\nThe last session of the Presidential Council, consisting of Heads of State of members of the Union, which took place in Casablanca, offered our five countries the opportunity to reaffirm their determination to pursue their integration efforts in all fields. The main outcome of the session was the establishment of the institutions of the Union as well as the adoption of a number of important decisions which will undoubtedly contribute to the promotion of cooperation between members of the Union and their neighbours.\nSince its inception, the Arab Maghreb Union has given high priority to dialogue with the European Economic Community as a whole and with the four European countries situated on the western shore of the Mediterranean. Our objective in doing so is to establish a new form of relations between Europe and the Maghreb which will contribute to the strengthening of peace, security and cooperation in the Mediterranean area as a whole. Tunisia, which will host the summit of the group of nine western Mediterranean countries, scheduled for early next year, is committed to pursue, along with its partners in the Maghreb and Europe, its efforts to ensure the success of this promising dialogue and to contribute to the promotion of North-South cooperation.\nTunisia, which has always wanted to strengthen the Arab role on the international scene, was honoured to host the Arab League for more than 10 years, during which it put at its disposal all possible facilities, allowing it to strengthen its institutions, improve its procedures and efficiency and gain more international credibility. The same sense of responsibility made us respond to the wish of the Arab world - expressed at a time when Arab and world conditions were going through a difficult period - to relocate the League's headquarters from Tunis to Cairo.\nToday we cannot but express our satisfaction that this great Arab institution was able - thanks to the collective will of Arab leadership - to overcome the effects of the painful Gulf crisis. Tunisia is working hard to resume Arab collective efforts based on confidence, mutual respect and brotherly cooperation, to further the cause of peace, security and stability in the Arab world and the world at large.\nThe Gulf crisis, with its effects on the Muslim Umma, showed that this group of countries is able to stand up and preserve its unity, thanks to the real political will of Muslim leaders and the hard work done by the Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, efforts which he is continuing in order to build new confidence and open up real possibilities for a new start in collective Muslim action. We hope that the coming summit of Muslim countries in Dakar will offer an opportunity for reconciliation and give further impetus to relations between Muslim countries in this important phase of international relations.\nTunisia views with satisfaction the progress made in Africa in seeking solutions to bilateral conflicts, which have been a source of concern to us all. These problems include the question of Western Sahara, which we follow with special attention because of its bearing on security in the Maghreb region and on the future of the Arab Maghreb Onion. We are optimistic that a settlement to this problem will be found. Such a settlement will strengthen peace and security in our region and promote cooperation and complementarity between nations in the Maghreb.\nAs for South Africa, Tunisia, like all other countries, welcomes the abrogation of the apartheid laws. This important development could not have taken place without the international pressure and the economic boycott measures taken against Pretoria. However, it is even more important that this step should be crystallized and made effective in such a way that it becomes felt in everyday life, especially on the political level.\nWe take pride in the launching of the African Economic Community at the last African Summit held in Abuja.\nWe are hopeful that this new and all-embracing framework of South-South cooperation would make it possible for African countries to achieve economic integration in the interest of all our peoples. This would also contribute to consolidating the foundations of justice, solidarity and equality, the two pillars upon which the new international order must rest.\nTunisia, which deeply believes in the importance of international cooperation, is convinced that the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the international arena requires a parallel strengthening of its role in promoting multilateral economic cooperation. In today's increasingly interdependent world the United Nations must effectively participate in promoting comprehensive and equitable development. The Organization must also intensify constructive consultation on such important matters as customs barriers, indebtedness, the negative transfer of resources and the restrictions imposed on free trade among nations.\nIn this connection, we believe that the present tendency of solving economic problems on a bilateral basis must not take precedence over the multilateral approach. In this context, Tunisia welcomes the commitment recently made in London by the group of the seven most-industrialized countries to promote the establishment of a world order in which development will be a responsibility shared by all countries of the world.\nWhile changes that are taking place in Eastern and Central Europe have led to the crumbling of the walls and the eradication of obstacles between East and West, they have also thrown into bold relief the differences that exist between rich, industrialized countries, on the one hand, and the impoverished developing world, on the other. It would be regrettable indeed were the attention of the international community to be focused solely on the building of bridges of cooperation between East and West. Developing countries, in general, and the countries of Africa, in particular, are well aware of the importance of the changes now taking place in the world economic situation and are fully conscious of their national responsibilities in this context. That is why Tunisia has taken it upon itself, since 7 November 1987, to enhance its credibility vis-\u00e0-vis its trading partners, through a series of measures aimed at readjusting its economic and social life. This is an objective we are determined to achieve through the optimum utilization of our disposable resources. Despite the reduction in our external financial resources and the adverse effects of the Gulf crisis, Tunisia is working hard to mobilise all its resources to enhance its economic capabilities. In so doing, it is trying to involve all sectors of society in the development process, with a view to promoting technological progress and the creation of job opportunities. However, we feel that the results of those endeavours, despite all our sacrifice, are still not fully satisfactory owing to the adverse impact of the world economic environment. Still, our confidence in the efficacy of international cooperation will remain as strong as ever.\nFive years ago developing countries felt encouraged when the multilateral trade negotiations were launched in Punta del Este with the adoption of the ministerial declaration the Uruguay Round. Indeed, we expected the Round to contribute positively towards putting an end to protectionist tendencies and allowing developing countries to play a more effective role in world trade in a way that would respond to their present and future development needs. We continue to hope that the trade negotiations will lead to concrete, equitable and useful results for both developed and developing countries, for we believe that the promotion of multilateral cooperation and reassurance of economic partners throughout the world with regard to the soundness of world trade are essential and urgent tasks that must be performed if we are to ensure a stable and larger flow of world trade.\nThe forthcoming eighth meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) could, we believe, contribute to attaining some of our common goals, given the necessary political will. Indeed, UNCTAD offers a suitable framework for strengthening world trade in a way that would improve its effectiveness and make it more equitable by allowing developing countries to play a greater role in the decision-making process and to enhance their involvement in world trade. We believe that the restructuring trends we can now observe in Eastern and Central Europe promise the dawning of a new era of cooperation between East and West and, at the same time, between North and South.\nThe current profound world changes that are taking place on the political, economic and technological levels demand the adoption of a new outlook and an approach based on a comprehensive treatment of various world problems. We must adopt a dialogue based on solidarity and mutual respect as our common rule. That in turn means that all countries must be given equal opportunities, without discrimination or exclusivity.\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has called from this very rostrum for the adoption of a pact for peace and development in the world, one that would give concrete form to the principle of effective solidarity between developing and developed countries. While reiterating that proposal, we reaffirm our belief that the United Nations, as the most appropriate forum for dialogue and consultations on the international level, is the best setting for the consideration of this issue.\nTunisia, which looks forward to the attainment of that far-reaching objective, continues for its part, and in the framework of Its own geographic environment, to work towards that goal. It is in this context that we seek the adoption of a programme of cooperation and understanding in the Mediterranean basin on the basis of what we call \\\"co-development\\\". In our view, this is the best way to promote progress and security on both shores of the Mediterranean and the means of narrowing the economic and technological gaps that exist between the Mediterranean countries through the adoption of a resolute policy involving problem-identification and the finding of the means capable of dealing with such problems collectively. We believe that this formula, which can be adopted in other parts of the world as well, cannot be put into effect unless it is accompanied by a number of parallel measures that, in our view, should focus on three basic issues, namely, indebtedness, emigration and environment.\nThe debt problem which obstructs development, has been seriously aggravated as a result of the deviation of the flow of external resources. I would emphasise here the danger inherent in these factors for the political and social stability of developing countries. We call upon the international community to give serious consideration to the Craxi report, which contains proposals that, we believe, properly express the concerns of our countries in this respect. We would certainly be gratified if such proposals were to be accepted and implemented. If that were to be done, the international community will have removed a serious obstacle that obstructs the developing countries' efforts to resume their development and progress.\nThis session is also called upon to assess the implementation of resolution 214/45, pertaining to the issue of debt and development. In this connection, it would be appropriate for us to examine all ways and means of avoiding the exclusion of any group of developing countries from the benefits of debt relief measures, especially the medium-income group of countries. In this regard, allow me to express again my sincere hope that all our partners will find it possible to give effect to the idea of recycling developing countries' debts into certain agreed development projects. This is an idea that has already begun to be implemented.\nOur Organisation and its specialized agencies have time and again stressed man's right to live in a proper environment free from any kind of pollution. This leads Tunisia to give particular importance to environment protection and preservation at both the national and the regional levels. We believe that this is an issue that must be given special priority in any serious vision of the new world order. We do hope that the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 in Brazil will be successful in formulating a plan which the world must put into effect to protect future generations from the dangers of tampering with the delicate natural balances and over-utilization of our finite resources.\nWe are today at the threshold of a new world order whose shape and objectives we must all help define. Tunisia hopes to bring its contribution, through its continuous efforts to consolidate world peace and international cooperation and through its modest inputs in the search for solutions to current problems. Let me emphasise once again that development, security and peace are dependent on dialogue and consultation at the international level. This will require from all of us strict adherence to the United Nations Charter and wholehearted commitment to its goals and objectives. What is at stake today is the very future of mankind. That future can be ensured only through real solidarity.\nThis conviction leads Tunisia to nurture the hope that the United Nations will focus most firmly on development problems, thus allowing all nations to join efforts for the common purpose of achieving everlasting peace and security for all, these being the basis for any human progress.\nI thank you for your kind attention, and I present to you again my greetings and those of my country, Tunisia.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is indeed a pleasure to congratulate you, Mr. President, upon your election to this high office at a time of such great achievement and promise for the United Nations. It is also a great pleasure to see the new Member States present and particularly to welcome Norway's close neighbours the Baltic States, which have now regained their rightful place among the free and independent countries. We stand before a new horizon and a changing political map. Our abilities to cope with a wide spectrum of common concerns are greatly improved by the convergence of interests of major Powers and between the North and the South. \nPeace, democracy, environment and development - these are the core issues of our common agenda for the twenty-first century. These are not separate issues; they are closely linked. Working together, not against each other, we can have a vision of a better-managed world, of better governance, and of global adherence to the fundamental principles of democracy, to market economies with a strong social dimension and a human face, and to the understanding that economic and social development must be sustainable.\nThe profound changes in the Soviet Union are among the four or five most decisive events of this century. Soon we hope to see 700 million people in Europe alone enjoying democracy and common economic market conditions. The signed arms reduction treaties must now be ratified without delay in order to consolidate the political East-West acquis and to accelerate the integration of the East into the world economy.\nWe firmly believe that stability and economic growth in the Soviet Union are essential, for the people of the Soviet Union, for Europe and for the world. In order to support the ongoing transition and to support the integration of the Soviet Union into the world economy, we urgently need both economic and democratic lifelines between the Union, the Republics and the democratic world. We cannot just sit and wait for the situation to become more orderly. The greatest risk we can run is to take no risks at all.\nThe United Nations must adapt to the changing world. We who as a matter of policy and conviction have always supported the United Nations also have the foremost duty to stress the need for continued United Nations reform. We need a more dynamic, better focused and securely financed United Nations which sets the priorities based on present and future needs. This cannot be a General Assembly doing business as usual.\nHaving recently withstood severe tests, the United Nations now can proceed with confidence and assertiveness. Let us imagine what it would have been like to assemble here in New York in September 1991 if Iraqi occupation forces had still been in Kuwait. What kind of credibility would any discussion of peace-making, peace-keeping and conflict prevention have had if we had failed to counter such flagrant aggression? But the United Nations rose to the challenge and brought us closer to the collective system for international peace and security envisaged in the Charter. Any potential aggressor must now think more than twice, and all countries can be more secure with the major Powers now working together - not against each other - here in the Security Council.\nThe Security Council is and must remain the foremost guardian of our collective security. To meet the present and future challenges it is important that the full weight of the Security Council be brought to bear.\nSimilarly, the high office of the Secretary-General has clearly defined responsibilities. His role in preventive diplomacy should be further strengthened. We must give him and the United Nations the means as well as the clout. Nothing less will serve us.\nAn essential part of the security problem is the arms culture which we have allowed to flourish. How could we allow the enormous clandestine build-up of power in some countries? Governments and the private sector alike are responsible. Governments have failed to establish the necessary international rules, and the private sector has exploited that vacuum in pursuit of profit.\nNever again can we allow dictators to arm for aggression. Irresponsible regimes must be denied access to weapons of mass destruction. He must have a world-wide ban on chemical weapons and limit trade in arms. We support the idea of a register of all arms sales. The United Nations needs to give this issue top priority. If the five permanent members of the Security Council, which are the principal manufacturers and exporters of arms, can cooperate also in this important field, we have a chance to improve the situation.\nIn too many countries we see military budgets of astonishing proportions. The international community is likely to examine such national priorities. How can there be any justification for allocating 10 per cent, 15 per cent or even higher percentages of State budgets to military spending when education and health receive far less, and when the future of those countries lies not in arming but in educating a healthy population?\nWe must address issues of peace in a precautionary manner. True conflict prevention means vigorously addressing all the underlying causes of human conflict and distress.\nAbove all we must be uncompromising in our determination to alleviate poverty. Look at sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of the population is being robbed of any hope of a decent future. Just look at the appalling gaps between the opulent wealthy and the most miserable poor. It is appalling that hundreds of millions of people live on less than a dollar a day. How can we live with a situation where 40,000 children die each day of malnutrition and disease?\nWe must break that vicious circle. Poverty is both a cause and an effect of the devastating environmental breakdowns in many developing countries, which threaten vital life-support systems on which future generations depend. We must break the deadlock of poverty causing large-scale migration and ever-increasing numbers of refugees.\nIf we fail to resolve the poverty issue now, our problems will multiply. The population explosion is likely to double or triple our numbers, with 90 per cent of that increase occurring in developing countries.\nDebt relief is necessary. How can developing countries make the investments needed to provide health, education and basic amenities for such growing populations when today they are suffocating under crushing burdens of debt and when financial flows are going from poor countries to the rich?\nCreating economic growth in developing countries is essential, and the concept of growth must be adjusted to the requirements of sustainable development. People must have a real chance to acquire the means whereby they can make their own choices and take responsibility for their own future. We must create a world economy in which all countries can participate on an equal footing.\nTo get out of the crisis, we need to improve developing countries' access to the world market. A striking illustration has been offered by the World Bank: developing countries would have the benefit of some $ 55 billion if they were granted unrestricted access to the markets of the industrialised countries. This is equivalent to what they now receive in aid.\nThe Uruguay Round is vital and must be successfully concluded. World trade must be governed by common rules. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) must be the stronghold of trade discipline. Enforcing mechanisms are important, particularly for weaker parties.\nMoreover, we need coordinated macroeconomic policies and the advisory roles of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nWhile economic policies are important, all evidence supports the assertion that social development depends on democracy and on pluralism. Alone, even the best economic policies will not suffice unless the human potential of a healthy and educated population can be unleashed and unless people can participate in political life without fear.\nAid will remain important, in particular for Africa. Many donor countries can increase the quantity of their aid and improve its quality. I feel I can point to this since Norway maintains its development assistance in excess of 1 per cent of GDP, the highest in the world. Yet, aid alone can never solve the poverty problem. Aid must be designed to help in building sound economies and in implementing policies of social reform.\nIn less than nine months, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will be held in Brazil. Our ambitions for this Conference must match the nature and the magnitude of the problems facing us. Scientific evidence shows how serious these problems are. We are overloading the planet's ability to absorb the effects of human activities in ways never before experienced in human history. While we still have time to make necessary changes, that time is fast running out.\nFor the Rio Conference to be truly successful, it is essential that governments become involved at the highest level in the preparations and that they not wait until the Conference itself.\nThe large number of non-governmental organisations and independent conferences now preparing their contributions to the Conference are presenting positive challenges to governments. Public forums are being held in all regions of the world. All these activities demonstrate that sustainable development is a participatory process on which we all should build.\nIndustrialized countries are still the biggest polluters. But we need a climate of cooperation between the North and the South if we are to conclude the international agreements that we need. And unless we are able to provide additional money and technological cooperation to developing countries in order to tackle their existing environmental and developmental problems, chances are less that they will see their best interests served by global agreements. Additionality, equity and efficiency are the only options that will work.\nEfficiency means that we must search for cost-effective solutions to environmental problems. If we fail to do so, then we risk stagnation of the whole process. Our goal must be to achieve maximum environmental benefit at the minimum cost. He will all benefit if we reduce emissions where reductions cost the least. This must be the primary objective of a new generation of environmental agreements.\nIn the ongoing negotiations on a climate convention, Norway has proposed a cost-effective way of achieving targets set to limit global emissions of greenhouse gases. Targets can be reached by States acting individually or in cooperation with other States. If they do, this would encourage investment in countries where reductions can be achieved more cheaply than the high-cost countries. This could tap new financial resources and encourage the private sector to take part.\nThrough a clearing-house we could make specific projects known, which could attract potential partners in the North and the South, projects which are economically profitable and which will lead to reduced total emissions by the countries involved. Then, I believe, we can truly pursue the common good by pursuing common interests.\nThe record of the United Nation as the universal protector and custodian of human rights is widely acclaimed. Still, it remains a paradox that human rights are systematically and persistently violated even today. We must oppose and obstruct such violations tirelessly and relentlessly. We must admit that we have been too selective in the past in pointing a finger at specific problems. We must defend human rights wherever and whenever they are violated. We must use the means of implementation and we must strengthen them when they are imperfect.\nIn the light of the experience gained in connection with the Gulf crisis and the horrifying prospect of large-scale violence, social disruption and civil war in various regions of the world, we cannot simply put a lid on the new debate on the relationship between the concept of national sovereignty and the authority of the international community.\nWe have reached a stage in the ethical and political evolution of our civilisation in which the compelling force of a broad public opinion will raise the issue of international enforcement in exceptional circumstances involving grave atrocities. Massive, deliberate violations of human rights will become known to the international community in an age of instant global television.\nWe should not pretend that there are easy solutions. But we must stress that governments are accountable for the way they treat their own populations. The United Nations must deal seriously with these dilemmas.\nA tragic number of natural as well as man-made disasters have placed tremendous additional burdens on many developing countries. This year we have witnessed the tragedy of the Kurds, the new famine in Africa and another disastrous flood in Bangladesh. The international community has all too often been slow to react to such disasters, as if they were completely unexpected. We have seen too many examples of international relief efforts that are slow in getting off the ground when crises occur.\nToo often, we see the lack of clear institutional responsibility and an ensuing lack of coordination. There is a need for a permanent machinery operating on red alert. There is a need for the United Nations to be given the resources to deal more quickly and more effectively with such crises. Responsibility should be vested in a person serving directly under the Secretary-General, who has sufficient authority to ensure effective action on behalf of the United Nations family.\nIn closing, I should like to express our respect and gratitude to our Secretary-General, who has guided our work for 10 years with such distinction and who has steered the Organisation through some of the most difficult, but also the most promising years, of its history. His impeccable moral integrity, his sincerity and courage, and his outstanding political judgement, have enabled the United Nations more than once to rise to the occasion. The world is indebted to Javier Perez de Cuellar, a man of dedication and skill for having served us - the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin by saying how delighted I am to be back here at United Nations Headquarters, and how honoured I feel to have this opportunity of addressing the General Assembly. I bring with me greetings to you all from Africa, and in particular from Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the whole Swazi nation.\nAllow me to offer my congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Swaziland is confident that your proven experience in international affairs, your outstanding diplomatic skills and undoubted leadership ability will ensure the successful outcome of deliberations on the vital issues we are addressing at this session.\nMy congratulations go, also, to the officers of the General Assembly for their election to office at the nerve centre of affairs in our Organization. Much rests on their abilities and skills, and we are confident of their success.\nMr. President, I would like to express my country's gratitude to and praise for your predecessor, Mr, Guido De Marco, who, together with his able \ncolleagues, steered the affairs of our Organisation so successfully. Ha are indeed indebted to him for his skill, diplomacy and leadership.\nI am here today to renew Swaziland's pledge of commitment to the Charter and ideals of the United Nations. The events of the past 12 months have shown, perhaps more than ever before, the value of our Organisation, and we take great pride in our membership and continued commitment to the ideals in which the hopes for peace in our world are placed. We extend the hand of friendship and congratulations to our seven new Members, and we welcome them to the one truly international family.\nOur world is experiencing turbulent times. I doubt whether we have witnessed such global activity since the establishment of our Organisation 46 years ago. Each new event has presented a fresh challenge to the effectiveness of our guiding principles. I am proud to say that we are meeting those challenges in the spirit of unity and cooperation on which the United Nations is founded. No one has doubted the effectiveness of the United Nations in the Persian Gulf earlier this year. The situation demanded prompt action, and our Organization delivered it in a unified and cooperative fashion never before experienced in the history of the world.\nWe are witnessing the birth of a new world order in which the hopes, ideals and aspirations of all nations are growing ever closer, and which augurs well for future generations. The successes we have achieved would not have been possible without the inspiring leadership of our Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The demands on this one human being are enormous as the world looks to him for guidance in each new crisis. Swaziland salutes the qualities which have brought him such outstanding success, and we ask God to give him the wisdom and strength to continue in his endeavours. \nFor much remains to be done. Swaziland has followed with interest the course of events as they have occurred across the world over the past 12 months. Much we have applauded, but some natters give cause for concern.\nI have already referred to the crisis in the Persian Gulf. He in Swaziland share the belief of all small countries in the principles at stake in that situation, and gave our full support to the United Nations resolve to bring about a swift and complete solution.\nWe commend the role of all members of the coalition in bringing about a fast and successful conclusion to the crisis. In addition, we applaud the actions of the people of Israel, whose restraint contributed in no small measure to the success of the operation.\nSwaziland was deeply saddened by the toll of dead and wounded on both sides of the conflict. Let those who lost their lives act as our inspiration in our efforts to avoid such confrontations occurring again.\nOf course, recent developments in the Gulf give renewed cause for concern. The obligations on all parties in the matter are clearly defined, and Swaziland fully supports the United Nations in its resolve to ensure that the region will not experience such disasters again. Let us pray that moderation, through compliance with our resolutions, will prevail.\nIn this regard, we also support the efforts being made to bring about a permanent resolution of the situation in the Middle East region as a whole. Swaziland has always advocated the use of the negotiating table as a peaceful means in the settlement of disputes. We are confident that such a course will bring about a solution acceptable to all parties.\nEurope continues to provide a focal point of global interest. It is extraordinary to think that in the two years since I was first privileged to address the Assembly the political map of Eastern Europe has been redrawn.\nThe inevitable teething problems of new nations and reformed ideologies are being painfully Experienced, and Swaziland sympathizes with all who are suffering as a result. History tells us that nothing of worth is achieved overnight, and without suffering, and we ask God to give the strength to endure.\nHe are saddened to witness the violent events in Yugoslavia, as that most feared of all conflicts - internal civil war - grips that unhappy nation. All efforts to support a swift and peaceful solution to its problems must be encouraged. He look forward to a permanent and effective ceasefire and the use of dialogue to restore stability.\nSwaziland is encouraged by the continuing process of arms reductions being undertaken by the United States and the Soviet Union. Our combined aim must be to rid the world of the menace of weapons of mass destruction, and we therefore applaud the commitment of both Powers in providing an example to other nations to take a similar view.\nThe failure of the unconstitutional attempt to remove the Soviet President provided an example of the unprecedented global cooperation we are experiencing these days. Almost universal condemnation of the actions of a few, who were attempting to enforce their will on the majority, helped restore stability and displayed the power of international unity.\nSwaziland has been watching developments on the Korean peninsula with great interest and with hopes for an early settlement of disputes between North and South. We therefore applaud the President and people of the Republic of South Korea for their attempt at dialogue, encourage them and pray for their success.\nWhatever success has been recorded in recent times - and there is much cause for self-congratulation for us in the United Nations - it is nevertheless painfully clear that much still needs to be done to redress the many imbalances so evident around the world.\nAs an African Head of State, I feel an enormous responsibility to put my continent's case, as our situation continues to worsen and the economic divide between North and South widens alarmingly.\nThe figures are there for all to see. Our poor growth rates, huge external debt and low output are just a part of the demoralising story of Africa. The consequences, too, of war, natural disaster and social upheaval combine to project what could be seen as an entirely gloomy picture of our future, and threaten to cloud our vision as we attempt to find solutions.\nMr. President, you will be aware that I am here representing not only my kingdom, but also, as Chairman of the Eastern Southern African Preferential Trade Area (PTA) Authority, the 18 States and more than 220 million people who comprise our membership. The story of the PTA, and of the other regional cooperation organizations, holds the key to our continent's economic future. For the PTA was born out of a desire to improve the standard of living of all our peoples, not by relying on the charity of others, but by combining our resources and talents and finding our own solutions to our economic problems.\nOur hope is that closer regional cooperation will reduce our reliance on the resources of a developed world which has changing priorities and new targets for assistance. I was reassured to learn on a recent visit to the European economic Community headquarters in Brussels, and in meetings with World Bank officials in Washington last week, that, for the time being at least, the developed world is not planning to sacrifice its assistance to Africa in favour of other recipients.\nBut to achieve true economic security our emphasis must be on self-motivation and self-sufficiency, to provide firm and lasting economic platforms on which we can build to give future generations the stability we have so far been denied. We undoubtedly need help to succeed; but, with the right support and unswerving commitment, we will succeed. An example of the type of assistance we require is embodied in the ideals underlying the Unite - Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Despite expressions of good will and commitment made by delegations during the special session, positive results have so far not been achieved. We look forward to monitoring improvements in this programme.\nWe are of course aware that winning the economic fight is only one part of the battle. Africa continues to experience major social and political upheavals, many of whose effects are delaying the economic recovery of our continent.\nOn the positive side, we have been delighted to witness the accession to independence of Namibia, the cease-fire in Angola, the start of dialogue between rival factions in Mozambique and the reform process under way in South Africa.\nThe situation in the Horn of Africa, Chad and Liberia continue to give cause for concern, and we can only pray for swift conclusions of the problems and offer our support for their resolution by peaceful means.\nSwaziland is of course watching the situations in Mozambique and South Africa with particular interest. Our country has always had a reputation for hospitality, and we have consistently followed a policy of non-aggression and the settlement of all disputes through discussion rather than confrontation.\nWe are currently playing host to approximately 75,000 refugees who have fled the problems affecting our friendly neighbour, Mozambique. This figure represents almost 10 per cent of our population, and clearly stretches our resources. He therefore applaud all efforts by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to assist us in our task and indeed in all the other areas in which it operates.\nMeanwhile Mozambique continues to be upset by civil war. While we are encouraged by the signs of dialogue between the rival factions, we would strongly appeal to this body to give more effective support in resolving this crisis. Too many Mozambicans have suffered from the unhappy situation, and that country deserves our help.\nI should like to record Swaziland's support for the reform process currently under way in South Africa. We are convinced of the commitment of all parties to the reform process, and we offer our encouragement for a successful conclusion to the negotiations, with a blueprint for a new South Africa which will be acceptable to all.\nWe are not so naive as to believe that this process will be easy. We are already witnessing the problems associated with any radical change, and we are sad in our knowledge that these problems will not vanish overnight. But, equally, we are convinced of the necessity of change and confident that the South African people will find solutions which will cater to the aspirations of all groups and bring about a permanent end to the violence which has been a feature of life there for so long.\nWe in the region look forward to the full participation of South Africa in our various cooperation organizations. Much of the future success of our economic groupings depends on the involvement of our region's most influential country, and the welcome presence of representatives of all parties at our meetings indicates their willingness to participate in the future.\nAnd, so, what of Swaziland? Our Kingdom continues in its peaceful way to tread the path of moderation. We have taken on added regional responsibility\nby accepting this year's chairmanship of the Preferential Trade Area Authority and the vice-chairmanship of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference. We take our commitments to these two influential organisations most seriously, as they give us the best hope for future economic stability.\nAlthough tradition and our unique culture influence us strongly, we are not standing still. We recognise the need for change; not simply for the sake of change, but in order to adapt to changing circumstances and to benefit the majority of our people. Our priorities for action echo those of any developing nation, with education, health and employment chief among them.\nWe are blessed with a beautiful land, and we are determined to keep it that way. We fully support the United Nations initiatives to promote greater environmental awareness; already the Government has begun a process of information, so that Swazis can begin to appreciate what is required of them in their new environmental responsibility. I can assure the Assembly that we will be active in our participation in next year's conference in Brazil and energetic in our implementation of any recommendations.\nLet me conclude by repeating that Swaziland is proud to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals of the United Nations. Recent events have given all of us good cause to be happy with our collective achievements and spur us on to tackle remaining problems with renewed vigour and determination.\nI am personally privileged to have this opportunity to present the view of youth, and I will say that I am confident that the future of my generation is being very well served by the actions of this house.\nLet me express Swaziland's deep appreciation and admiration for the achievements of all who work for the United Nations in any capacity, as we pledge our continuing confidence in the performance of its many and varied roles throughout the world, in pursuit of the goal of international peace, stability and cooperation between all nations.\nThank you for your attention, and may God watch over us all.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me particular pleasure, on behalf of the Albanian delegation, to extend to the President my heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. His election is an appraisal of his personal diplomatic qualities and a credit to his country. I am fully confident that his presidency of this session will be effective in realizing the objectives to which the international community aspires.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express our gratitude and high esteem to Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, who presided over the deliberations of the last session with competence and objectivity.\nAllow me also to extend our felicitations to His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his outstanding contribution to peace and international security and for his persistent endeavours to enhance further the role and efficiency of the United Nations. He will shortly step down from his post, but he will be remembered for the deep imprint he has made upon the Organization.\nI am also delighted to welcome the admission to our Organization of the two Koreas, of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania as full-fledged Members. He hope that their membership will make the United Nations more universal and efficient in dealing with the problems before it.\nSince the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly the international community has been witnessing developments and changes that cannot fail to have an impact on the future of mankind. Especially significant have been the transformations in Central and Eastern Europe, which have brought about the dismantling of political and economic structures that had become outdated, the renunciation of the sterile political and ideological stereotypes of the past and the exploration of new avenues to democracy, development and peace.\nToday, Europe presents a new political landscape where the words \\\"West\\\" and \\\"East\\\" have merely geographical connotations. Confrontation between the two blocs, which had resulted in a political ice-age, is currently giving way to the human values of democracy, economic and social development, the security of each country and, above all, to the growing assertion of the peoples' aspirations to self-determination.\nAlthough the cold war is already a thing of the past, like some serious \\\"pneumonia,\\\" as it were, it has left deep scars on \\\"the lungs\\\" of humankind, and of Europe in particular. It is its very recidivism that makes Croatia cough blood now. It is the repugnant virus of Stalinism that caused Yugoslavia to become the sick man of Europe and Kosova its guilty conscience. Had Europe and the rest of Yugoslavia, where the winds of freedom and democracy are blowing, reacted with proper attention at the right moment and prevented the Serbian national-chauvinists, at least over the past 10 years, from turning Kosova into a testing-ground for establishing their hegemony over Yugoslavia as a whole, things would have been quite different now and we would not have had to deal with the Yugoslav crisis, which is posing a threat to peace and security in the Balkans and in Europe.\nLife is showing that the process of rapid democratic changes on a continental level is accompanied with difficulties and often with tensions and even conflict. It is significant, however, that it is no longer the regressive and conservative forces that determine the course of historical events. Nowadays the thirst for democracy, equality among nations and for the freedom of the individual have become a driving force of society. Also encouraging is the fact that the international community is becoming well aware of the need to pool its energies and means with a view to coping with the thorny issues of the time, to averting the danger of war and to eliminating those factors that had all but paralyzed international relations over more than four decades. This was clearly manifested in the reaction of the United Nations Security Council and the international community to the occupation of a small country, in this instance Kuwait, by a big and powerful country, Iraq. The Gulf war and the defeat of the aggression there indicated, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Peres de Cueliar, has pointed out in his annual report, that: \\\"the only available course is that of organizing international life on a stable basis in accordance with principles clearly understood, generally accepted and consistently applied. The principles are those articulated in the Charter of the United Nations.\\\" (A/46/1, p. 5). It is understandable why the international community is increasingly reaffirming the values of the United Nations, of this universal Organization which has an irreplaceable role to play, especially at the turn of this century when mankind is at such a stage of development where no State or nation can on its own meet the challenges of our time.\nFor more than four decades, the so-called cold war period, East-West confrontation dominated international political life. In the shadow of that confrontation the Western democracies experienced a period of relative peace and sustained development, something that cannot be said about the Eastern European countries, where the centralized system of the economy and the rule of a single party that identified itself with the State led to stagnation, to the curbing and even freezing of the factors that stimulate progress, to the violation of human rights allegedly in the name of the priority of the interests of the collective and the society over those of the individual.\nThe last decade of the current century began with great hopes for the peoples of Eastern Europe. The Iron Curtain that had divided East and West for many long years has been pulled down, and the winds of change, of freedom and democracy, have begun to blow over the countries of the East. It has already become evident that the systems in those countries failed to meet the expectations of their own peoples. Economic and political reform was a must for the emerging democracies.\nIn Albania, known as the last bastion of Stalinism in Eastern Europe, the deep democratic processes commenced when the youth and the students, imbued with inexhaustible vigour and aspirations to a more promising future, accelerated the advent of the season of democracy, which has been welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the Albanian people.\nAlbania is currently living through an important period of transition to democracy. Our aim is not merely the restructuring or renovation of the former system but the setting up of a new and truly democratic system that recognizes and practices the human, political and socio-economic values sanctioned in the documents of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and in other important international acts. Through far-reaching and all-round reforms and constructive cooperation with the European countries and the international community, Albania is moving towards the establishment of a pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law and a market-oriented economy and ensuring human rights and freedoms for the individual. The economic reforms essential for setting up an open market economy are being carried out in tandem with social and political reforms Intended to bring about fundamental constitutional changes, to lay the groundwork for free and democratic elections and to achieve the recognition and the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights, including the recognition and protection of private property and independent trade unions. We are aware that the road upon which we have embarked is not easy, but we are convinced that it is the only option to rescue Albania from its backwardness and to realise the all-round political and social development of the individual and of the society as a whole.\nWe have today a pluralist Parliament that emerged from the first free democratic elections of 31 March of this year, a National Stability Government, with the participation of representatives from five parliamentary or extra-parliamentary parties. In cooperation with the Parliament, the Government is working intensively to build the legal framework, so indispensable for the success of the economic reforms, being fully aware of the importance of political and social stability. The dynamics of political life in Albania, the extension and enrichment of the spectrum of political parties, the evolution of the views and positions of the electorate, have put on the agenda the holding of new elections which, whenever held, will reflect the political consensus of all the political forces in the country.\nAt present, Albania is facing a grave economic and social crisis. It is related to the legacy of the failing single-party system, which we have abandoned, as well as with the difficulties of the transition period we are going through. These difficulties arise from the endeavours made to fill the vacuum created by the renunciation of the former system with institutions and structures which respond to the new system we are setting up. It is obvious that the aforementioned vacuum cannot be filled overnight. Hence, the transition period is also accompanied by a crisis of confidence which stems as much from the desire and impatience of the people for speedy changes, as from the inertia which slows down the pace of these changes. It is worth mentioning that this crisis of confidence, along with the economic difficulties, has led recently to an exodus from Albania to neighbouring countries. \nWe have neither encouraged, nor do we want our citizens to flee the country; we are fully convinced that this negative phenomenon can be averted through rapid economic development and the establishment of full democracy in Albania. However, under the really difficult economic conditions of our country, understanding, support and assistance by the international community would guarantee the stabilisation of such a situation. He appreciate the understanding shown towards the Albanian emigrants, just as we appreciate even more the solidarity, support and assistance of all those who understand the importance of avoiding an economic collapse, which would have a great impact on the future and on the success of democracy in our country.\nWe welcome and support all the profound democratic changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe. These changes have made it possible to realize the aim of turning the region into a zone of cooperation, confidence and security. The Republic of Albania continues to bring its foreign policy into line with the democratic changes that are being pursued in the domestic field. A distinct feature of this policy is its abandonment of the past legacy and ideological burden which, in fact, distorted it and gave rise to Albania's isolation from the rest of the world. Our current foreign policy is open and unprejudiced and seeks relations of friendship and cooperation with all countries of the world, for the good of our all-round development and international peace and security.\nThe diplomatic relations and links established only over the last few months with the United States, the European Community, the United Kingdom, Israel, the Holy See and the Republic of Korea are testimony of this reorientation of our foreign policy. Thanks to the democratisation process, Albania is filling in the blanks on its diplomatic map and is coming ever closer to the rest of the world.\nAlbania's admission in June 1991 as a full-fledged participant to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) was an event of historic significance for us. This testified not only to the vital and universal character of the values this process had brought about, but also to the integral nature of present-day Europe. At the same time, it showed that the European countries are always in search of the best possible ways of development and cooperation among themselves. The main characteristic of this cooperation is the principle of free choice and the balance of national and international interests.\nAt present, international security is being perceived more and more on a global scale, as closely tied with the unity and indivisibility of peace as with development as the prerogative of stability. The supreme value of international peace is closely linked with the implementation of the principle of the non-use of force in international relations and security for all and constitutes a permanent task of the utmost importance.\nAs a small country, Albania is highly interested in stability and security in the Balkans, which has suffered - and still suffers - from many problems of a national, political, ethnic and religious character, that are currently so conspicuously evident in the Yugoslav crisis. The long drawn-out crisis in Yugoslavia has been a source of great concern and preoccupation for the international community, especially for the countries of Europe. The concern of neighbouring Albania, with half its population living in Yugoslavia, is a legitimate one. This crisis, which culminated in the outbreak of the conflict and the armed attack by the Serbian and federal army against Slovenia and Croatia, indicated that there can be no real peace in Europe so long as - even in a single country - democratic values and commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes and the principle of self-determination of peoples, are not observed. It is the first time in contemporary history that the federal army of a multinational country has attacked and occupied some of its own integral parts. With the help of the federal army and police, before cracking down on Slovenia and Croatia, Serbia occupied Kosova, a constituent element of the Yugoslav federation. All this goes to show that peace cannot be established without the decisive commitment of the whole international community.\nThe free and democratic elections in Slovenia and Croatia, which contributed to the overthrow of the communist regime, also deprived the champions of Greater Serbia of the right to take control of all the most important functions of government, like the army, diplomacy, national security, and so forth. This triggered off a brutal reaction on the part of the Serbian national-chauvinists, who, using the federal army, which is dominated by them, are leaving no stone unturned to get rid of the democratically-elected anti-communist governments. Fear of losing control of the Republic of Kosova has led Serbia to go all out in preventing Kosova and its people from holding free elections. It would promote the final settlement of the Yugoslav crisis if the Albanian people received a guarantee from Europe and its democratic institutions, and the international community, concerning the holding of a referendum, as formulated by the Kosovan Assembly, through its resolution dated 22 September 1991, which proclaims Kosova an independent and sovereign State with a right to constituent participation in the League of Sovereign States or Republics of Yugoslavia. Today, all nations are entitled to be free, independent and unified, provided this is achieved democratically and by peaceful means.\nThe very fact that the federal army is acting without constitutional control and the tendency to settle disagreements by force of arms constitute the most dangerous threats to stability in the Balkans and Europe since the Second World War.\nSerbia is seeking to unify by force the Serbian population living in various parts of Yugoslavia. It is also using force to keep the autochthonous Albanian population in Yugoslavia under occupation.\nWhile EC is trying to establish peace in Yugoslavia, Serbia refuses to withdraw from the occupied territories. As far as Serbia is concerned, the only purpose of the Peace Conference is to legalise the occupation of these territories by finding a formula for the self-determination of the Serbian minority in Croatia and denying the same right to the 3 million Albanians who come third to the Serbs and Croats in Yugoslavia.\nThe Republic of Albania believes that the solution of the Yugoslav crisis depends on the implementation of the principle of self-determination in a peaceful way through dialogue, on the basis of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Paris Charter. With that end in mind we have joined in all the efforts of the European Community to solve the Yugoslav crisis and have supported all the initiatives it has taken in this regard.\nThe free expression of the will of the people constitutes the cornerstone of the new European architecture. Bold and unprejudiced acknowledgement of and, Above all, respect for this will would determine the reliable future of Europe. In this context, we support the will of the Albanian people in Yugoslavia, as outlined in the Acts of 2 July and 7 September 1991 of the Parliament of Kosova, the only legitimate organ of the Albanian population.\nHow that Slovenia and Croatia have declared their independence and Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have proclaimed their sovereignty, a new situation has materialised in the Yugoslav State made up artificially of various units following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. Under these circumstances the Albanians, who comprise the only non-slav population - violently and unjustly incorporated in the composition of this multinational State - should enjoy the right to have their say about their future.\nThe Republic of Albania holds that the representatives of the Albanian people in Yugoslavia can in no way be excluded from the peace conference on Yugoslavia and from the negotiations on the future of its peoples. Their participation is a right articulated in the current Constitution of Yugoslavia which guarantees Kosova its legitimacy within the federation. Their participation in the talks is not only just but also a must for the future of Yugoslavia and the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. To ignore a population, six times that of the Republic of Montenegro, is to establish peace simply through the force of arms.\nIt is to the benefit of the peoples of Yugoslavia, the Balkans and Europe if the complex problem of the Yugoslav crisis is solved by taking into account all the factors involved. Neither arrogance and force, nor the pretense of disregarding these factors can keep peoples with different languages, cultures and history together against their will.\nSincerely believing in the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflicts, the Albanian people are confident and hopeful that the international community and the democratic institutions will help in the peaceful and just solution of the Yugoslav crisis, satisfying all the parties to the conflict.\nWe uphold the understanding displayed by the permanent members of the Security Council and their desire to cooperate in the solution of regional conflicts. He highly value the persistent efforts made by the Secretary-General and the initiatives he has taken for the peaceful settlement of a number of problems. Similarly, we welcome the efforts that are being made by the United Nations and the commitment by the United States and the Soviet Union to peacefully solve regional conflicts such as those in the Middle East, Cambodia, Western Sahara among others. The Albanian Government hails all positive steps leading to the elimination of apartheid in South Africa.\nThe deepening of the economic crisis in many countries and regions of the world is a destabilizing factor which threatens the hitherto political achievements on an international base. While the industrialized countries are recording economic growth, the developing countries are experiencing economic decline and stagnation. To alleviate this tendency and source of contradictions, the United Nations must work out a new strategy for development. Multilateral commitment is vital to finance stabilisation programmes, lift trade barriers, transfer modern technology and so on. There is no doubt that these countries should exert their efforts and seriously commit themselves to solve their acute economic problems.\nThe abuse and illicit trafficking of narcotics has now become a serious concern for all countries. In some of them, this deadly social ill has assumed destabilising proportions. Often linked to arms smuggling, it has grown into what may be called narco-terrorism. He cannot but express our concern over this phenomenon. We consider that the United Nations and its specialised agencies have an important role to play in preventing it.\nConsidering the scope and complexity of the transformations and problems facing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the demonstration of greater political and humanitarian solidarity by the rest of Europe and all the other countries of the CSCE is of special importance at present. They can thus build a new European architecture and a new international order which, in turn, would bring about genuine security, peace and prosperity for all in full harmony with common democratic human values.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations has to play an important role in this regard. In the new conditions of profound democratic processes taking place in Europe and of the democratisation of international relations, our Organisation that brings together the hopes and interests of the peoples and countries of the entire world, cannot but reinforce its indisputable commitment to find new, peaceful and democratic solutions to global issues ranging from regional conflicts, disarmament and environmental protection to the prevention of terrorism and drug trafficking and to other problems which arise in the course of time. It is as encouraging as it is promising that the Member States of the United Rations are displaying ever greater understanding of the need for active involvement of the United Nations in the solution of the world's problems.\nFor its part, Albania has totally committed itself to making its own modest contribution to our Organisation so that it may achieve the goals for which it was founded and honourably discharge its mission.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. We also extend our sincere appreciation to Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta and all earlier Presidents of the General Assembly whose efforts have guided and enriched the work of this body on behalf of the people of the world. At the same time we express our gratitude and respect to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his tireless efforts to promote peace and security in the world. The people of Estonia have laboured and persevered for generations in order to join this body as a fully sovereign nation at peace with its neighbours. We look forward to working under his guidance in the United Nations.\nIt is with great pleasure that we welcome the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as full members of this body. With equal feeling we welcome the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nWith particular pleasure we welcome the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania and remind ourselves that the peoples of the Baltic States have never gone to war against each other. Instead, we have shared a common history - colonial domination by stronger neighbours who have fought their wars on our soil and at our expense. When we entered the League of Nations after the First World War our peoples hoped that a new era had begun. As we join the United Nations and put the Second World War behind us we renew our faith in the principles on which this body is based and trust that a new era has indeed begun.\nThe Estonian people have finally realized their age-old dream of self-determination. Estonia's independence as a State has been restored and recognised by the world community. Estonia values highly its acceptance as a Member of the United Nations and stands ready to fulfil its international obligations.\nWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to those who supported us In this struggle through so many years. We give particular thanks to Iceland - a country the small size of which did not stand in the way of moral courage. The people of Iceland will always have a special place in our history. Unfortunately, acceptance into the United Rations does not solve the many problems we face in consolidating our independence. Central to these are questions that relate to the traditional political and economic orientation of our country. Historically and culturally Estonia has always had strong ties to Western and Central Europe. That was true even under the domination of the Russian Empire during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Between 1940 and 1991 the Soviet occupation disrupted those ties but did not manage to destroy them.\nIn terms of the political and economic development of Estonia, an immediate priority must be the restoration of those ties and the restoration of a European way of life. To achieve these aims, we wish to integrate as quickly as possible with the political and economic structures of modern Europe. Estonia is already a full member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), has strong ties with the nations of the Nordic Council, and has initiated discussions on cooperation with the European Free Trade Association. Finally, many members of the European Community have expressed their interest in our becoming an associate member of the European Community.\nEstonia's orientation towards Europe does not, however, mean that It will fall to understand the needs and aspirations of the developing countries. We feel that we are in fact better positioned to appreciate these issues than the Western countries whose values we share. The Baltic States have emerged from a long and difficult period of colonial rule. He hope that this experience augurs well for close ties and cooperation with the third world.\nEstonians know full well what it means to live under foreign domination, especially when that domination is based on totalitarianism. For that reason, Estonia cannot take any position that fails to support the right of all peoples to self-determination.\nConsidering this, the Government of the Republic of Estonia recognized the independence of Slovenia on 26 September. Independence is the free choice of the Slovenian people and Slovenia fulfils the criteria for independent statehood under the generally accepted principles of international law. Estonia is convinced that respect for the right of the Slovenian and Croatian peoples to self-determination is the most effective way to achieve a solution to the Yugoslav conflict in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\nAt the same time, Estonia can only accept peaceful means based on democratic principles and respect for human rights - as well as respect for the rights of minorities. These are, after all, the principles on which the people of Estonia have based the restoration of their independent statehood.\nIn the short term, Estonia's highest foreign policy priority is the normalization of relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I am happy to report that yesterday the Soviet Union and Estonia established formal diplomatic relations. It is in the interests of Estonia to pursue a policy based on friendly relations and Mutual respect for national sovereignty, Estonia also considers it essential to preserve actually beneficial economic ties with the republics of the USSR. The precondition for this, of course, is continued progress towards democracy in the republics of the USSR, in an atmosphere of internal stability. Estonia hopes that those republics can solve their economic difficulties and forestall the violent disintegration of the USSR. Such an event could lead to a civil war capable of threatening the stability of the entire world. \nWe are also concerned by the attitude of the USSR in connection with the process of fully realising Estonian statehood. While the State Council of the USSR recognised the Independence of the Baltic States on 6 September 1991, we find that there are political forces and Government agencies of the USSR that fall to acknowledge or to accept the restoration of Estonia's independence. Those structures show no evidence of coming to terms with the new political realities. Most notable is a desire to maintain future relations with Estonia as if Estonia were a constituent republic of the USSR. This attitude is prejudicial to Estonian sovereignty and we hope that it will be as unacceptable to the world community as it is to the people of Estonia.\nA separate and immediate issue is the timely withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces from Estonia. The Estonian Government is concerned about the efforts of some Soviet political leaders to delay the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Estonian territory. For example, Anatoly Sobchak, leader of the Soviet delegation in negotiations with Estonia, has repeatedly stated that troop withdrawals cannot begin before 1994. Estonia understands that some time must be allowed for Soviet occupation forces to return home. We do, however, believe that this goal can be accomplished with greater speed.\nOf special concern is the continued presence of nuclear weapons and assault troops on our territory. We are also disturbed by the continued existence of large foreign military contingents in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, a presence that threatens the sovereignty of the Republic of Estonia. For that reason, on 5 October 1991 the Baltic Council decided to propose to the USSR that Soviet occupation troops evacuate all Baltic capitals by 1 December this year.\nRegarding the general issue of European security, we applaud the fact that the process of democratisation in the republics of the USSR, taken together with the restoration of the Independence of the Baltic States, has markedly reduced tensions in Europe. No longer do we have a trip-wire of confrontation separating East and West. This new reality has become the basis for Estonian national-security doctrine. We do not consider ourselves neutral since we no longer see a Europe divided into hostile alliances. Estonia wishes to cooperate with its neighbours on questions of defence and strategic doctrine, as well as with all other members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in the context of the CSCE process.\nIn the spring of 1990, Estonia held parliamentary elections that were as democratic as possible under the conditions the. prevailing. Now that independence has been restored and a flourishing multi-party system has been established it is both necessary and desirable to hold new elections. The Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia has decided to call new elections in 1992 in order to seat a new and more representative parliament under conditions that conform to all generally accepted principles of democratic government.\nOf course, the internal political situation in Estonia is not without its problems. Fifty-one years of foreign occupation have weakened the political traditions nurtured during the period of independence. However, this difficult experience has taught us that only a democratic political system and a market economy can address the interests of the Estonian people. A Constitutional Assembly has been convened to develop a new constitution based on that understanding. That constitution will be in accord with the provisions and principles of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as established by the Council of Europe on 4 November 1950.\nIn the economic sphere, statutes are being prepared that will facilitate the conversion to a market economy based on the rule of law. During the past year, laws have been written to establish private property rights, protect the interests of foreign and domestic investors and institute a fair taxation system that is favourable to private investment. The principles behind these laws are in accord with those implicit in the membership requirements of the International Monetary fund and the World Bank.\nBetween the two world wars, Estonia was unique among the nations of the world community in terms of its steadfast and tolerant approach to minority rights. Estonian statutes on cultural autonomy for minority nationalities were a remarkable exception in a Europe torn apart by hatred and fear. These statutes guaranteed to each national group and religious minority the opportunity for education in their native language, their own publications, the freedom to practise their own religious customs, and freedom of cultural expression as they saw fit. The revival of these liberal principles will be a good basis for cooperation between the many different nationalities living in Estonia today.\nDuring the years of occupation a great many non-Estonians were settled in Estonia. Many of these people think of themselves as having found a new homeland and have supported the aspirations of the Estonian people to self-determination. We find it self-evident that the citizens of other countries residing in Estonia should have the opportunity to apply for citizenship on the basis of a fair and equitable citizenship law. If they wish to work in Estonia while remaining citizens of other countries, that opportunity will not be arbitrarily denied them.\nThe Republic of Estonia and its people are in the process of rejoining the world community after 51 years of foreign occupation. We shall not waste this opportunity for which so many have suffered. He wish to rejoin Europe as a democratic State, as a good neighbour, as a State that respects human rights, and as a trustworthy partner in the affairs of nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn transmitting the sincere congratulations of the Government of Madagascar, allow us to echo the words that have been expressed since the Assembly elected you to conduct the business of its forty-sixth session. You are a man of experience, dialogue and conviction, and we know that you will place these qualities at the service of the Organisation and of international cooperation.\nThe same concern guided your predecessor. Ambassador Guido de Marco. Right to the end of his mandate, he constantly took the initiative to strengthen the role of the General Assembly to represent us where events were important, thus committing us to greater responsibility. He did not disappoint the trust that we placed in him, and we are grateful to him.\nFinally, my delegation bids welcome to the delegations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Korea, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. We will always be ready to seek and develop with them the common good in solidarity and understanding. We are particularly happy that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea now have an opportunity to work within the Organization for the independent, peaceful reunification of their country, without foreign interference.\nUniversality is once again on our agenda. People often talk of the universal acceptance of the principles of the Charter and of certain values, and when we admitted to membership the seven new Members that I have just mentioned it really is the universality of our Organisation that we are proclaiming even if the end of the cold war, as in the past the end of the colonial era, promoted expanded participation in international life.\nWe believe that this participation is essential if we wish to counteract marginalization and hegemony. So long as there was confrontation or rivalry we sought to have recourse to solutions always based on commonly acknowledged, albeit rarely applied, principles, when the time came to take a decision. Our situation was certainly an awkward one because we were convinced that we were siding with reason while at the same time we felt that we had no grip on reality. From one frustration to another we gave less importance to the right to participate, and universality gradually gave way to antagonism or, even worse, to indifference.\nBut times have changed. The march of history has speeded up and not a month, a week or a day passes without our being assailed by events that are difficult to analyse or react to immediately and whose significance is realized by us through the effects that inevitably follow in other places and in other fields.\nIn a word, the frenetic and intense pace of events that we are witnessing leads us to believe that we are experiencing a world revolution affecting all human activities. The subject is too important to be skimmed over in an obviously limited statement, but right now we have to define our positions in the context of a situation that we cannot ignore any further. In the meantime, allow me to tie Ariadne's thread and turn to more prosaic considerations, that is to say to the activities of our Organization.\nThe Secretary-General has accustomed us to a relationship in which he agreed to share with us his hopes and his disillusionment, his satisfaction at certain positive trends and his concerns about the obligations of Member States. Again this year he has continued in that tradition although we are somewhat disappointed because as a \\\"gentleman\\\", in the classic meaning of the word, he has refused to give an assessment of his mandate.\nHowever these were 10 years during which quietly and patiently he has seen to it that the Organization has a new confidence in itself; 10 years of rehabilitation and revitalization. The work will never be done but it will be recalled that it was under his mandate that the Organization lived through its finest hours, illustrated by the peace-keeping operations that won us the Nobel Prize in 1988; the accession of Namibia to independence; the end of the war between Iraq and Iran; the normalization of the situation in Afghanistan; the entry into force of the cease-fire in Western Sahara; the comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia; the mediation and observer missions in Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador and Angola; the role the United Nations played after the Gulf War; and, recently, the release of the hostages in Lebanon.\nIt is true that the questions of Cyprus, the Middle East and South Africa remain outstanding but we know the interest that he has in them and it is no mere chance that in Cyprus the parties there have renewed their commitment to continue their discussions; that the peace conference on the Middle East is in hand; and that, finally, a peace agreement has been signed between the parties concerned in South Africa to put an end to violence.\nA tribute is due to the devotion of the Secretary-General, to his ability to look ahead and to act and particularly his concern to preserve the prestige and effectiveness of the Organization in all circumstances. It will not be said that the tribute that my delegation has just paid to the Secretary-General is intended to pass over in silence the questions of concern to our Organisation, that is, the questions of political and economic security. However, before touching on that I wish to turn again to the situation in southern Africa.\nWe take note of the measures taken by the South African Government to dismantle the legal bases of apartheid while hoping for a more honest initiative to eradicate the very spirit that promoted the birth and maintenance of apartheid.\nWithin the United Nations we must define another strategy to speed up the process already started and shoulder our responsibilities in a specific manner for the advent of a new South Africa, a non-racial and democratic South Africa. So that the Organization may consistently struggle against apartheid, it must be there to guarantee and satisfy the aspirations of the majority; it must offer its good offices, mediation and even its arbitration to all parties to guarantee a political presence and in order to prevent the risk of a breakdown in the current negotiations.\nThat is the least we can do now that the role of the Organization in the maintenance of peace and international security has evolved in such a marked way. Because, by definition, the settlement of the situation in South Africa will have an influence on peace, regional security and cooperation - and my country is concerned in this - and also, by definition, the absence of this settlement will once again lead to threats to the peace and to international security.\nThe era of bipolarisation is over - it is now a mere historical curiosity in East-Meat relations - whereas North-South contradictions still exist despite protestations of solidarity and interdependence. Notwithstanding that, the vision of a more just world has not been abandoned. And in this inevitable transitional period, which is so full of promise and uncertainty, we recognise that public opinion is right to pin its hopes on our Organisation, whose principles remain universally accepted and respected. This consensus has enabled us to make better and fuller use of the machinery envisaged in the Charter with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security.\nHowever, we believe that many of the provisions relating to collective security have never been given optimal effect. We are thinking in particular of the opportunities offered by the Charter in the field of preventive diplomacy. Other not incompatible paths also deserve exploration - establishing a system of evaluation, prevention, management and solution of crises and conflicts, and providing the Secretary-General with a suitable structure. Such measures would, we believe, help to strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nSimilarly, it is high time to provide the various peace-keeping operations with an official legal framework. Forged through practice, those operations have proved to be a new and more effective procedure, better adapted to present-day realities. This framework document would define their criteria and functions in order to forestall any violation of Charter purposes and principles to suit the special interests of an individual State or group of States. There will be no legitimate collective action without majority support, and we would be imperilling the democratic principle of our Organization were we, under cover of pragmatism or emergency, imprudently to\nset aside universally acknowledged norms in favour of theories that are far from being unanimously accepted.\nIn order for our Organisation to live up to the promises made to the peoples of the world, the following elements must be combined the mandate of the principal organs must be re-examined, bearing in mind interdependence and the global nature of the problems dealt with; coordination among those bodies must be strengthened to ensure improved harmonisation and greater cooperation; there must be a collective commitment to the Organisation's restructuring. In any event, the active participation of all will help us better to meet the challenges - and I use that word advisedly - posed by the pressing need for democratisation.\nThus revitalised, our Organization must commit itself as a matter of priority to preserving future generations from the scourge of war. Conditions have never been so propitious for achieving that purpose set out in the first words of the Charter. A military alliance has been dissolved, and Europe, meeting at Paris in November 1990, took concrete steps to reduce its immense concentration of armed forces. At the same time, the two nuclear super-Powers have begun destruction of types of weapons described in the various agreements in force; they have finally exchanged instruments of ratification for the threshold Treaty and the partial test-ban Treaty, and they have concluded the much-awaited Treaty on strategic arms limitation, the so-called START Treaty.\nThe initiative taken by President Bush on 27 September has now - and we welcome this - been added to the many disarmament proposals advanced by others. Clearly, a concerted and coherent approach is needed, for general and complete disarmament under international control, which is the ultimate goal of all our efforts, can be brought about only within a multilateral context.\nThe Charter confers upon the United Nations a central role and a primary responsibility in the field of disarmament. Member States solemnly reaffirmed this in the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We must recreate the consensus we enjoyed then and again place our trust in the United Nations, which so recently demonstrated its ability in such complex areas of disarmament as the drawing up of a draft convention on chemical weapons, the Special Commission set up under Security Council resolution 687 (1991), and the embargoes established by the Security Council.\nWe often say that international security, if it is to be credible, must also extend to the economic field. I shall not go into all the problems of the developing countries or into the challenges they must face, nor shall I dwell on the responsibilities of the developed countries in this respect. We have discussed this here and in other forums and I shall confine myself today to the case of Africa, which could also be that of other regions of the world.\nThe prime victim of the collapse of primary-commodity prices, crushed under the weight of foreign debt, suffering from major handicaps with regard to infrastructure, haunted by the spectre of famine, malnutrition and endemic disease, struck by various natural disasters - Africa has become the poorest region of the world, with a constantly increasing negative growth rate.\nAware of this situation, the United Nations adopted the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Five years after the adoption of that Programme of Action, its goals have not yet been attained. The response we were awaiting from the developed countries and international economic and financial institutions has not been commensurate with their commitments, whereas the majority of African countries have agreed to make the reforms that were imposed on them - and I use the word \\\"imposed\\\" advisedly.\nThe economic, social and political costs of that operation have been high, and we shall continue to suffer from them without being able to set any limits. Yet Africa remains ready to renew its commitment to implement the needed transformational policies, as is evidenced, inter alia, in the adoption of the African Charter for the peoples' participation in development and the proposals put forward following the final evaluation of the Programme. But the new framework for cooperation must be able to guarantee us sufficient resources, reduction and cancellation of debt, and adoption of lasting solutions to the problem of commodities, all in the hope that the pact thus concluded will enjoy the real support of Africa's partners.\nBut Africa is not the only continent in the third world, and it is our duty to echo the concerns felt in other regions with regard to our collective participation in world economic management. We speak of the globalization of the world economy, while what we are witnessing is fragmentation among the various interested parties, skewed methods of resolving key issues, a regionalization of economic activities among the industrialized countries and a weakening of discipline in financial, monetary and trade policies. Such a situation is not conducive to any new policy one might want to institute on a world-wide scale and prevents us from resolving problems inherited from a system that is being carefully kept in obsolescence in order to draw iniquitous profits from it.\nThus, despite the various initiatives and proposals, some of which have begun to be implemented and which may be useful for future reference, the foreign-debt crisis only gets worse. In order to resolve this crisis we need an international debt strategy containing long-term relief measures and greater debt-reduction compatible with the debtor countries' real ability to pay, taking into account their growth prospects and development. Thus, to free us from the constraints resulting from successive rescheduling, we reiterate the appeal for a fundamental re-adaptation of the existing mechanisms.\nSimilarly, the resources available to finance development, already inadequate, are in effect being diverted in order to satisfy other needs born of the integration of the Eastern European countries or the rebuilding o\u00a3 countries the victims of the Gulf war.\nThat is why we support the idea of convening an international conference on development financing, because it is time to consider all initiatives on ways to release additional resources and to take steps to allocate to development a reasonable portion of the \\\"peace dividend\\\", estimated at almost $120 billion a year.\nIn addition, we are convinced that the protection of the environment, far from being a marginal activity, must be considered an integral part of any development effort, with the support of the international community. Any solution proposed in this area must preserve our development priorities and guarantee the principle of proportionality as regards contributions and responsibility.\nThe complexity of the problems I have mentioned requires that multilateral economic cooperation be strengthened: North-South, South-South and sub-regional cooperation, such as what we are already doing in the framework of the Committee on the Indian Ocean, which is to regroup the islands in the south-western part of that Ocean. The Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its eighteenth special session and the new international strategy for development are the logical framework for such action.\nIt is appropriate, then, to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to deal effectively with all economic problems. A role of coordination and orientation should be given to the Economic and Social Council, which in future should be called the \\\"Council for Economic Security\\\" if we wish to see more just and equitable economic relations.\nOn bearing and reading the words of the heads of delegation that preceded me, I believe that there might be a consensus on the ideas of peace, progress and social justice, on the role of the United Nations in promoting these principles, and on equal, universal participation in international relations. It could not be otherwise, in fact, because we are condemned to our dreams - that is to say, to hope that there will be no more ideological confrontation, that solidarity will stave off any risk of domination and hegemony and that all nations will enjoy an equal right to well-being and security.\nForty-six years ago the problem was posed in the same terms. Peoples were given to understand - peoples whose aspirations have scarcely changed - that it sufficed to respect the principles of the Charter and to seek to achieve its stated objectives to guarantee the advent of a new era. We know what the situation is, and it is not appropriate for me to return to the recriminations resulting from injustices of all kinds. However, the new era that has been so widely proclaimed continues to be a Utopian ideal; we are still awaiting it.\nIt is not normal that from one decade to the next we blindly advocate a new order. It is not normal either for us to hide behind the universality of Charter principles to proclaim its inviolability. Nor is it normal that in a world committed to pragmatism we refuse to draw conclusions from the political, economic and social upheavals that affect all societies without differentiation. In short, we need a new Charter!\nA shocking conclusion to be sure, but let us recognize that in the end the revision of our Charter, in particular Chapters VII to XIII, will be only a temporary measure, soon to be overtaken by events. We do not intend to open a discussion on this subject at this stage, but we call on all members to give serious thought to this possibility and to start the necessary consultations. This will be a long endeavour, but let us be like the medieval cathedral-builders of Europe, always inspired by unfaltering faith.\nBefore I conclude and before I thank my distinguished audience, I should like to quote two Malagasy proverbs appropriate to our circumstances: \\\"Crossing a long plain gives one time to meditate\\\"; and \\\"A house is built by several people, not by just one individual\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have great pleasure in congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I am confident that your wise leadership will enable this session to deal successfully with the broad agenda before it. You may count on my delegation's cooperation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities. I would like to record my appreciation for the energetic and imaginative presidency of your predecessor, Ambassador Guido de Marco of Malta.\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has served the international community at a critical turning-point in modern history, deserves our deep gratitude and unstinting admiration. His indefatigable energy, dedication, diligence, imagination and resourcefulness have enabled the United Nations to play a pivotal role in the resolution of many crisis situations.\nI am delighted to welcome in our midst the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic- of Korea. India enjoys excellent relations with both and trusts that their admission to the United Nations will further contribute to dialogue and reconciliation in the Korean peninsula. This would also enable them to contribute more effectively to the strengthening of peace and security in the region and in the world at large. We are happy that the Baltic Republics - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - have taken their rightful place in the Organization. Similarly, I should like to congratulate the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands on their admission to the United Nations.\nIn the year that has elapsed since the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, India and the world lost a distinguished statesman in the person of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India. Rajiv Gandhi's commitment and dedication to the cause of peace and international understanding naturally made him an extremely ardent supporter of the United Nations. We firmly believed that the Organisation, where the entire international community is represented, offers an ideal forum to tackle the manifold problems facing mankind: eradication of poverty, disarmament, environmental conservation, elimination of the menace of drugs and so on. He was particularly concerned about the threat of total annihilation posed by nuclear arsenals, and he will long be remembered for the Action Plan for a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world that he presented to the special session on disarmament in 19BB.\nThe recent dramatic changes in the world have led to a restructuring of international relations. After decades of the cold war, there is a move towards dialogue to replace confrontation, trust to replace suspicion and, above all, peace and cooperation to replace strife and discord. Democracy is taking root in the Eastern European countries, which are, at the same time, making efforts to integrate into the world economy. The process of change in the Soviet Union, initiated by President Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, has received further momentum recently. Elsewhere in the world, too, there is evidence of the successful assertion of the democratic aspirations of the people. In our own region, there are the shining examples of Bangladesh and Nepal. As the Secretary-General has aptly put it in his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"Today there are far more solid grounds for hope than there are reasons for frustration and fear.\\\" \nWhile welcoming these positive changes, we cannot but be aware of the formidable obstacles we still face in the creation of an equitable and just world order. Glaring inequalities continue to plague our planet. Disparities among countries and groups of countries have not only persisted, but have also widened. If the promise of a restructured framework for international relations is to be realised, it must address the interests of all and must be accepted by all.\nIndia was among the first to speak out, several decades ago, against the division of the world into hostile camps. The policy of non-alignment, embraced by most of the newly independent nations, stressed the right of nations to determine their own destinies. The Non-Aligned Movement called upon the super-Powers not only to end their rivalry but also to work in cooperation for the benefit of the world. The present situation, marked by the disappearance of bloc rivalries and their replacement by increasing cooperation among major Powers, is a vindication of the Movement's basic plank. As the recent meeting of the Ministers of the non-aligned countries in Accra declared, the Movement will continue to be an important factor in international relations by pursuing the goal of establishing a society based on social, economic and political justice through dialogue and cooperation.\nThe relaxation of tensions in international relations has inevitably led to progress in the resolution of a number of crisis situations. In Central America, Nicaragua and El Salvador have ceased to be arenas of conflict and tension. Peace has dawned in Angola with the signing of an accord between the parties concerned. Cambodia is on the verge of a negotiated solution. Cyprus and Afghanistan also seem to be moving towards a peaceful settlement. In Western Sahara, a referendum sponsored by the United Nations is about to be held, ending decades of acrimony and conflict in the region.\nThe crucial role that the United Nations has started to play in these and other crisis situations is in keeping with its original mandate. The convergence of the objectives of the permanent members of the Security Council has led to a consensus among them on several issues, as envisaged in 1945. The United Nations, at the same time, needs to be strengthened and reformed in order to live up to the expectations placed in it.\nIn this connection, one of the challenges faced by the United Nations today is to make it truly representative of the interests and aspirations of all its Members and to make it an arena of cooperative action of all nations and peoples.\nAs the Non-Aligned Movement has recently reiterated, the current efforts at reform of the United Nations should include measures designed to make the decision-making process at the United Nations, particularly in the Security Council, more democratic and transparent. In this context, we should examine, as a matter of urgency, the proposals before us for an expansion of the Security Council to reflect the increased membership of the United Nations and to ensure a more equitable and balanced representation of the Members of the United Nations in the Council.\nThis year has seen the conclusion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), an outstanding achievement in the field of nuclear disarmament. For the first time in history, there is going to be real reduction in the strategic nuclear forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. This has been long overdue, but there is no reason to be complacent. The process of reduction of nuclear weapons must continue. The START reductions are very limited and are confined to numbers, without any effect on the quality of these weapons. The reductions should now be deeper, quicker and should involve all the nuclear-weapon States. The Treaty should not lead to qualitative upgrading of the remaining arsenals, nor should the warheads released be reused in other systems.\nNuclear weapons have no place in today's world and with the end of the cold war the irrelevance of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence stands further exposed. Unfortunately, new theories of deterrence are being developed in order to legitimise the continued possession end Improvement of nuclear weapons. Deterrence is now being conceived either in the balance-of-power context or against the so-called delinquent powers among developing countries.\nThe action plan proposed by India at the third special session on disarmament in 1988 assumes increased relevance today. The present is the opportune moment to commence work for a new treaty to give legal effect to a binding commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to eliminate nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework, and by all non-nuclear-weapon States not to cross the nuclear threshold. The implementation of the action plan could also help in ending the unnatural division of the world into nuclear \\\"haves\\\" and \\\"have-nots\\\" and the need to erect all kinds of discriminatory ad hoc regimes to sustain such a division.\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty symbolises this division. India has not accepted the Treaty because it does not impose reciprocal obligations on the nuclear-weapon States to eliminate nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the Treaty enforces inequitable full-scale safeguards on all the nuclear activities of the non-nuclear-weapon States without imposing commensurate obligations on the nuclear-weapon States.\nNevertheless, I should like to state that, even without having signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, India has scrupulously adhered to a non-proliferation policy and has never helped any other nation in developing nuclear weapons. We shall continue to abide by such a policy.\nWe also have our best opportunity in the coming year to conclude a global convention banning chemical weapons. India is committed to working along with all those delegations that wish to complete the work on a draft chemical-weapons convention within the stipulated time frame. What remains to be done in the field of verification, compliance and consultative mechanism should be accomplished without further delay through common effort and understanding. He should all realise that the greater good of humanity is at stake in the abolition of chemical weapons and this good should not be compromised for lesser, short-term ends.\nThe Gulf crisis earlier this year underscored the inadmissibility of aggression by one country against another. Like the rest of the international community, we feel gratified that aggression has been reversed. We rejoice that Kuwait is once again a sovereign independent State. The Gulf region has long been a focal point of tension and instability. This region is our neighbour, and we are hopeful and confident that, following the recent crisis, there will be peace and stability in the region.\nAs a member of the Security Council since January of this year, India has tried to play a constructive role in the Council's effort to deal with the Gulf crisis. We lent support to all endeavours to secure the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait without resorting to war. Once the war started, we combined our efforts with those of like-minded countries to bring it to a speedy end and, in any case, to ensure that the destruction and devastation unleashed by the war remained limited. We also tried to assert the Security Council's role in guiding the course of the war and in calling for a cease-fire. Being conscious throughout of the humanitarian aspects of the crisis, we made a number of proposals in the Council to provide succour to the innocent civilian victims of the conflict.\nThe Gulf crisis and the ensuing war severely damaged the economies of many countries, including my own. Nevertheless, we remained in step with the international community in imposing comprehensive sanctions. The Gulf crisis demonstrated that in the present era of global economic interdependence, the imposition of sanctions in a region, particularly when that region happens to be a major source of the energy supply, is bound to have an adverse effect on the economies of a large number of other countries both within and outside the region.\nOur experience of invoking Article 50 of the Charter to seek redress was, to say the least, both frustrating and disappointing. The consideration of our case took place after long delays and it resulted only in a call on Member States and United Nations specialised agencies to give attention to our problems. A lesson that we should draw from this experience is that, in future, a mechanism should be devised for the automatic commencement of action under Article 50 in the event of the imposition of sanctions. As the Secretary-General stated in his report on the work of the Organisation: \\\"n today's conditions of economic interdependence, the effect of the imposition of comprehensive economic sanctions on third States that are economic partners of the offender State requires that Article 50 of the Charter be supplemented by appropriate arrangements creating obligations to assist concretely the disadvantaged third State or States\\\". (A/46/1, p.6)\nThe Gulf region still suffers from the aftermath of war. The United Nations has the duty and responsibility to exert all its energies to remove the suffering, hunger and squalor left behind by the war. This is particularly true of the Iraqi civilian population, whose misery is not lightened by the continuation of economic and trade sanctions. We commend the humanitarian assistance provided to the people of the region by Member countries as well as United Nations agencies. At the same time, we believe that any outside intervention in a Member country on humanitarian grounds constitutes an abridgement of national sovereignty and is, therefore, fraught with serious implications.\nWe sincerely hope that the flexibility shown by all parties concerned will help to resolve the Middle East conflict, at the core of which is the Palestinian question. India applauds the assiduousness with which the United States has worked to get the various parties involved to the negotiating table. I trust that these efforts, along with those of the parties concerned, will mark a beginning in the resolution of the vexed Middle East problem. He believe that a just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question will be possible and durable only if it restores to the Palestinian people their fundamental rights, including their right to a homeland.\nI mentioned Cambodia earlier. Events there are shaping towards what we hope will be a peaceful resolution of the conflict. We specially welcome the Cambodian delegation to the United Nations, led by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Chairman of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, which has recently taken several initiatives in bringing Cambodia closer to an era of peace and restoration.\nIndia appreciates the contribution made by the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Paris International Conference on Cambodia towards resolving this long-drawn-out problem. We are glad to be associated with this process as a member of the Paris International Conference. The Cambodian people, who have suffered so much in the past, deserve the continued support of the international community to complete the badly needed process of national reconciliation and reconstruction. We look forward to the emergence of Cambodia as a sovereign, independent, neutral and non-aligned nation in accordance with the wishes of its people.\nI trust that the Secretary-General's five-point plan on Afghanistan will inspire the parties to the conflict to negotiate a framework for resolving this issue. We welcome the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union not to supply arms to the parties involved, but this step will be effective only if supplies from other sources also stop forthwith. The United States has a major role to play in this regard. We call for a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan which would preserve the sovereign, non-aligned and independent status of Afghanistan.\nOf late, further movement in dealing with the Cyprus issue is discernible. India supports peace efforts that ensure the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus, and in this light welcomes further negotiations under United Nations auspices. Myanmar remains deprived of the democratic rights its own people voted for over three years ago. India calls upon the Myanmar leadership to accept the people's verdict and work with them to restore democracy in the country.\nThe South African Government has recently undertaken a number of positive steps towards dismantling the apartheid regime. We welcome these changes. At the same time, we remain fully aware that a lot more needs to be done. The South African authorities must immediately take all necessary measures to start the process of negotiations. Equally important is curbing the continuing violence in certain parts of the country. The pressure that has been brought to bear on Pretoria by the application of sanctions has proved to be useful and must be sustained. The international community must remain vigilant until the complete eradication of apartheid and the transformation of South Africa into a non-racial, unitary democracy.\nWhile apartheid is on the retreat in South Africa, an attempt is being made to institutionalize racism in Fiji. The interim government in Fiji has incorporated into a new constitution certain provisions which are in violation of the internationally accepted principles of democracy and human rights. By institutionalizing oppression and injustice, Fiji appears to be moving backwards in history to a darker age. The Suva regime should abandon such anachronistic policies and join the rest of the world in enlightened democratic governance.\nIn the economic field, there is an increasing trend of integration of the process of production, consumption and trade in the world economy, brought about mainly by the communications revolution. This has led to an unprecedented enhancement of the interdependence of nations and increasing competitiveness among major operators in the world economy. One of the very significant outcomes of this phenomenon has been the creation and strengthening of regional economic groupings, particularly among developed countries. Western Europe is moving towards an integrated market by the end of 1992. The former East and West Germanys have been united. In a few years Germany is expected to emerge as an even stronger economic Power. While these are significant economic changes, we do not see concomitant moves towards meaningfully addressing North-South development issues.\nResponding to the changing realities, many developing countries are making strenuous efforts to carry out structural changes in order to meet the challenges. We in India have also introduced far-reaching changes in our industrial, trade and monetary and fiscal policies. Our aim is to remove unnecessary controls and regulations so as to release the creative forces in the economy and realise its full potential. As a consequence of these policy changes, we envisage sharply increased interlinkages with the world economy. We need the understanding and cooperation of our partners from developed countries to derive the full benefits from the measures we have adopted and as a cushion against the short-run pressures that may build up. We also need an international economic environment which is conducive to ensuring the success of such measures. In various multilateral organizations, it will be our endeavour to work towards establishing an international economic order which is truly multilateral and based on the principle of non-discrimination and the rule of law.\nThe overall external economic environment for developing countries remains unfavourable. Many of these countries are facing the problem of worsening terms of trade, increasing problems in finding access to advanced technology, and reductions in the resources available for development.\nThe overall debt situation for the developing countries has assumed alarming proportions and poses a serious threat to their economic viability. A solution to the developing countries' debt problem would need a comprehensive and integrated strategy encompassing all categories of affected countries and all forms of debt.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Secretary-General's proposal for an international conference on the financing of development deserves support. As he further points out in his report on the work of the Organisation:\n\\\"A reinvigoration of the North-South dialogue has now become more urgent than ever. Fortunately, conditions exist now for advancing it constructively without a needless overlay of rhetoric or ideological controversy.\\\" (A/46/1, p. 12)\nIndia attaches great importance to an early, successful and balanced outcome of the current Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. He are a serious partner in these negotiations, which we approach with an open mind and a considerable degree of flexibility. But we have our own concerns to be met and interests to safeguard. That is why we have been insisting that the overall package that emerges from these negotiations must contain specific and time-bound commitments on issues of concern to developing countries.\nThe developments of recent years have further validated the disarmament and development linkage and made it a reality. National budgetary policies of some of the major military Powers already provide for the channelling of resources now locked into the arms race into economic growth. The peace dividend now needs to be realized at the international level. The International Conference on Disarmament and Development envisaged mechanisms in this regard which should be put into effect. We notice another disturbing trend in the economic field. Attempts are being made to factor into the calculus of international and bilateral economic cooperation, non-economic considerations such as good governance, observance of human rights, environment, military expenditure, and so on. The Indian polity is firmly anchored on political pluralism and individual freedom. We attach high priority to the preservation of the environment and would very much like to reduce our military budget. But these laudable goals should apply to all countries, developed and developing. What is questionable is the linkage of these issues with development assistance of which only the developing countries are the recipients.\nEnvironmental concerns are fast moving to the top of the world agenda and are rightly at the forefront of international concern and attention. We are convinced that environmental problems cannot be isolated from the general issue of development and must be viewed as an integral part of development efforts. For global environmental problems to be dealt with effectively, we need to forge global partnership which seeks to protect the environment while simultaneously addressing the development requirements of the developing countries.\nIt is well recognized that the principal sources of pollutants in the environment lie in the developed countries and these countries accordingly bear the main responsibility for combating such pollution. Furthermore, if financial, technical and other capabilities are also taken into account, then it becomes quite clear that the responsibility for undertaking corrective action devolves on the developed countries. Without the provision of adequate, new and additional financial resources and environmentally benign technologies on preferential and non-commercial terms, it would be difficult for the developing countries to adopt environmentally safe and desirable technologies, much as they would like to do so. Such technologies should not become simply another source of commercial profit for the developed world.\nIndia will continue its constructive contribution to the preparations for the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We hope that at the Conference the twin issues of environment and development will be addressed in a balanced way and in their totality.\nIndia is glad to see changes around the world that serve to strengthen fundamental human rights. India's own deep commitment to human rights, true to its democratic traditions and practices, is well known. India's parliamentary institutions, independent judiciary, free press and public opinion provide the necessary checks and balances to safeguard individual as well as collective human rights. I would, however, urge caution in projecting the promotion of human rights in an intrusive manner that militates against national sovereignty. Contexts and situations differ from country to country, and international concern for human rights preservation should not detract from the efforts in the same direction made by the country concerned.\nIn recent years, terrorism has emerged as one of the most dangerous and pernicious threats to the enjoyment of human rights, peace and stability in many parts of the world. Through killings, kidnappings, extortion and other such means, terrorists and their organisations have effectively usurped the basic human rights of innocent civilians. In a number of cases, they are using brutality and fear to undermine the free functioning of democratic institutions, including the legislative, executive and judiciary branches of government, as well as the press. Such terrorism assumes a particularly pernicious form when it is aided, abetted and sponsored from abroad. Sponsorship of terrorism in another country constitutes a violation of the principles governing relations among States which have been enshrined in the United Nations Charter. This deserves the condemnation of the international community.\nDrug abuse control has gained a commendable measure of global co-operation. Drug abuse is a menace calling for concerted and strong action. India welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Global Programme of Action for international drug control. He would stress the need for additional financial resources and technical assistance for crop substitution and other measures to combat drug trafficking and abuse. In conclusion, let me say that we in India wish the recent epochal changes worldwide to be the harbingers of peace, prosperity and an equitable and just world order. The logic of progress in on the side of those who think and act progressively, not of those who wish to remain frozen in an unresponsive status quo. India looks forward to cooperating with other nations in the noble endeavour of strengthening world peace and cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for this session. I have no doubt that, like your predecessor, you will guide its proceedings to a very successful conclusion.\nWe extend our welcome to the new States Members of our Organisation - the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands - which widen and strengthen its universal framework. We also welcome the entry into membership of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, countries which have regained their liberty after the long night that followed upon the infamous Molotov-Von Ribbentrop Treaty. Of course, Argentina was among the first nations to recognise their independence.\nWe would also like to congratulate and thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for the way in which he has fulfilled his sensitive mandate. We are extremely proud that he is a Latin American. His term of office has been the most active ever in our Organisation's history, and he discharged it masterfully. No doubt, his thoughts and recommendations will be valuable contributions to the future of the United Nations.\nThe end of the cold war has established a completely new international framework. In a world from which conflicts will undoubtedly not vanish, but where the worst threats have been dispelled, the United Nations has an invaluable role to play as guarantor for these promising realities. Argentina is committed to supporting the endeavours of the United Nations. In that context, we reaffirm our support of the system of collective security enshrined in the Charter and in particular to the central role of the Security Council in maintaining peace.\nMy country is building a sound political and economic stability, thanks to which we Argentines can now make long-term plans. The Argentina of today is doing very well in a process that began in 1983 and has been solidly entrenched since 1989. We are living through profound transformations, and it is no mere coincidence that this should be taking place at a time when the entire world is strengthening the foundations of a new world order.\nThe changes in Argentina are the outcome of three serious crises over the past 15 years. The best thing that a country can do is to avoid crises; the next best is to learn from them, and that is what my country has done. The restoration of democracy was accelerated by the human rights crisis and the Malvinas crisis. Finally, the transformation of our foreign policy came as a result of our realising that our isolationist attitude of past decades was ineffective and led to confrontation. The crisis of the State-controlled economic model in 19S9 produced serious instances of hyperinflation which led us to a radical change of course in our economic thinking and to today's openness and stability.\nThe crises in hyperinflation, foreign policy and human rights together generated a total renewal of the country's internal and external economic and political profiles. Argentina has stepped firmly into a new era. This is a process that coincides with deep-rooted trends affecting the entire planet and many Members of the United Nations. In our case, the key to this evolution is that the strengthening of freedom and democracy go hand in hand with economic reform and openness. He can say with great satisfaction that the legitimacy of these reforms was reaffirmed by the results of the elections held recently in my country on 8 September, when the principal political forces coincided in supporting the policy of economic stability.\nSince 1989, Argentina's foreign policy has been marked by our will to join in the new international order, by the defence of our interests and by our international reaffirmation of democratic values. Furthermore, as a Latin American country we aspire to the consolidation of a greater Latin American nation encompassing the entire region. In the heart of all Latin Americans is a kind of nostalgia for such a greater homeland. Our joining in this new order has been affirmed by a number of specific measures, such as our active support of the Security Council during the Gulf crisis, which included the sending of military personnel; our current contribution of observers to various peace-keeping operations; and our explicit support for the processes of change in Eastern Europe.\nAdditional proof of our willingness to cooperate and our commitment to International peace and security can be seen in our excellent and Mutually beneficial current relations with the United Kingdom. This has occurred under the umbrella of a formula agreed upon with the British Government that protects the inalienable sovereign rights of Argentina over the Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands.\nConcerning this issue I reiterate that the Argentine Government believes that the new climate between the two countries should also - at the right time - facilitate the resumption of negotiations regarding sovereignty as this General Assembly has repeatedly requested.\nThe encouraging process of integration between Argentina and Brazil has great relevance, due to the intense efforts involved and its transforming consequences for our countries and the region. Last March the two States, together with Paraguay and Uruguay, signed a treaty in Asuncion for the establishment of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), which should be set up by 31 December 1994. He have no doubt that the Asuncion Treaty will come to be for our region what the Rome Treaty was for the Community. What we are saying is not a small matter, but nor is what is at stake.\nThe magnitude of this regional economic area becomes evident if we consider that the population of the participating countries is 190 million and their gross domestic product (GDP) more than $400 billion, that is, 2 6 per cent of the GDP and 51 per cent of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nAt the same time, we consider that the Americas Initiative formulated by the President of the United States is a positive proposal. It encourages us to work together with solidarity and on equitable grounds and on the basis of concrete facts such as trade, the debt and investment. The framework agreement recently signed in Washington between the United States and the emerging MERCOSUR is also very promising for a future of fruitful cooperation in our sub regional relations with that country.\nThanks to important agreements recently signed with Chile, it will soon be possible to say that there are no longer any points of disagreement in the demarcation of the long boundary between Argentina and its sister country, and this opens up the possibility of carrying on an intensive programme of economic cooperation, which is crucial for both nations.\nWith Brazil we have also made significant progress in other sensitive areas. Last August our Presidents signed an agreement on the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. Negotiations are also going on between the two countries on the one hand and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the other, for a safeguards agreement that will enable IAEA to monitor nuclear facilities in Argentina and Brazil in order to verify that our nuclear programmes are exclusively for peaceful purposes.\nIn this respect, I should like to reaffirm that the Argentine space programme is solely one of peace and cooperation, fully transparent and subject to the existing international safeguards. That is why we have decided to adhere to the missile technology control regime.\nTogether with Brazil and Chile we have taken the historic step of pledging not to manufacture chemical or biological weapons. In this very concrete way our countries definitively exclude the possibility that the southern tip of the Americas might be affected by the consequences of the irrational use of scientific progress. In this context, I wish to reaffirm my country's firm commitment to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction from the Latin American region.\nI explicitly reaffirm our commitment to the respect of human rights and political pluralism both within and outside our borders. The new era which began with the end of the cold war is characterized precisely by the triumph of these political ideals and of the market economy as its most efficient instrument. The consolidation of these new and positive circumstances demands steadfast resistance to any abandoning of principles. The Argentine Government refuses to be an accomplice to the justification, under any pretext, of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Economic and social rights are no less important than civil and political ones, but the attainment of the former cannot be used as a pretext for denying the exercise of the latter. The imposing of conditions for the effective exercise of human rights has been resorted to time and again by non-democratic regimes.\nThe Argentine Government also emphasises the right of the international community to point the finger at those responsible for gross and systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Argentine Government therefore takes an active part in the Commission on Human Rights and has ratified the Inter-American Pact on Human Rights. At the last Assembly of the Organisation of American States (OAS), held in Santiago, Chile, we signed a declaration of multilateral commitment to the defence of democracy. There is only one real lacuna in the efforts for the consolidation of the Latin American region. My Government is eager to ensure that Cuba will very soon, in peace, return to the international community, emphasising a market economy and the defence of human rights, issues that are already being addressed by their former colleagues of Eastern Europe.\nOur recent withdrawal from the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries reflects our view that the end of the cold war and the establishment of a new international order have deprived the very concept of non-alignment of meaning. It reflects also our frustration at the movement's refusal to commit itself unequivocally on matters such as those mentioned above, which go beyond the opinion and behaviour of many of their member countries. We are firmly committed to the protection of the environment and to the fight against drug trafficking. These are areas in which, for the sake of higher principles linked with the interests of mankind, the international community has the right to exercise effective control. Here we note with particular satisfaction the convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to take place next year in the sister republic of Brazil.\nOn the other hand, Argentinean foreign policy is at the service of the Argentine people, and is inspired by democratic ethics. For decades the Argentine Republic suffered a constant and growing impoverishment, the main victims of which were its people. Confrontational foreign policies brought about high costs, which were suffered above all by the poor and the needy. My Government has chosen to eliminate useless confrontation from its foreign policy because it considers that such confrontation is counterproductive to its own interests, as well as to those of the new international order. This it an instance in which morality converges with pragmatism, and in which defending legitimate material interests is equivalent to defending principles.\nAt the same time we emphatically demand that an end be put to the protectionist practices that are distorting the international markets for agricultural products through production support measures and export subsidies. These policies do not have a rational economic foundation either for the countries that apply them or for us. On the one hand they do not allow efficient producers to place their agricultural exports and on the other it punishes the contributors and consumers and the largely urban sectors of those countries which implement these policies of protection. Furthermore, these policies promote serious ecological degradation, which is brought about by these production methods and the excessive use of chemicals, which cannot be sustained by the environment. That leads to a greater environmental Imbalance than the very serious destruction of the tropical forests. On the other hand, there is a flagrant asymmetry in trade practices that tolerate subsidies to agricultural exports while banning those to industrial exports. Only very rich countries could apply such mistaken policies, but even they jeopardise global productivity and risk their future competitiveness by applying such policies.\nWe are convinced that the elimination of all subsidies will be beneficial for all nations. He will continue our struggle in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and in agreement with the other members of the Cairns Group until we achieve this goal. We expect the clear support of the United States and the understanding of the Community as regards the need for reform. The future, no less than that of international economic cooperation, depends on our ability to find a multilateral solution to these problems in order to avoid destructive trade wars and safeguard the positive spirit of Bretton Woods.\nIn order to create firm economic links with the Western European countries, Argentina has signed agreements on the promotion and mutual guarantee of investments, and is willing to negotiate agreements for the elimination of double taxation, which will facilitate the normal flow of capital in both directions. At the same time, we have rescheduled our debt with the Paris Club.\nWe look forward to more flexible Interaction with the European Economic Community. We trust that the framework agreement signed a little over a year ago and the agreement signed in April 1991 on the establishment of a delegation in Buenos Aires will strengthen relations and facilitate exchanges. I should like to refer to my country's position regarding three specific issues - aspects of the current world situation that are of particular interest to my Government.\nAmong the many positive changes that have taken place in the world, we are encouraged by the South African Government's programme of political, social and economic reforms, aimed at dismantling the unfair system of apartheid completely and forever and at paving the way for the building of a new South Africa. That is why we have decided to re-establish diplomatic relations with that State. This step is one indication of our commitment, together with the international pressure, to the establishment of a fair and democratic society in South Africa, based on the principle of one man, one vote and on the total elimination of racial discrimination.\nOn the other hand, it is a matter of concern to us that, in spite of countless efforts and steps forward towards a peaceful solution to many regional conflicts, the international community has not yet found a just, peaceful and definitive solution to the question of Palestine. We support the call of the United States for the convening of a peace conference in the region, aimed at achieving a satisfactory and final solution to the various issues at stake, including the restitution of occupied territories and recognition of the right to secure and internationally recognized boundaries. In this context, the Argentine Government, as was stated last year in the General Assembly, believes that the time has come to leave behind offensive language based on analogies between Zionism and racism. That would help to create a climate of agreement that would facilitate the current diplomatic initiatives.\nIn regard to our Latin American region, I with to express the Argentine Republic's support for the ongoing efforts to reach a definitive solution to the conflict involving El Salvador. I wish to reaffirm my Government's recognition of the role of the Secretary-General and that of his Special Representative. I wish to note also the positive attitude of the Government of El Salvador in the search for consensus based on peace, justice and the consolidation of democracy in that sister nation. We valued particularly President Cristiani's visit to Argentina this month.\nAll of mankind's hopes for the remaining years of this century converge in assigning a key role to the United Nations. In that sense, 1991 has been a revealing and decisive year in overcoming scepticism. The Security Council, in particular, has shown its effectiveness, thanks to the cooperation born of the end of the cold war. It is up to us to see that these positive trends continue to be strengthened. The United Nations is undoubtedly the proper forum to discuss problems and to find solutions and ensure their implementation. Accordingly, we must commit ourselves to the most stringent respect for our Charter and to the most united and enthusiastic defence of the spirit that it embodies.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. Tour election signals our recognition of your personal competence, experience, skill and wisdom, and of the high esteem which your country, the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, enjoys in the international community. I would also like to extend my many thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta, for presiding over the previous session.\nI also take this opportunity to single out with gratitude Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for his tireless efforts during the period he has spent at the helm of the Secretariat.\nIt is indeed a good omen for our Organization to start this new session by admitting seven new States to its membership, some of which, such as the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, are newly independent, while others - Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia - have just regained their independence, and still others had their applications for membership delayed because of political circumstances. This multiple accession to the membership of the United Nations contributes greatly towards its achieving universality. We would like to express to the two friendly Korean Republics our pleasure at their admission to the United Nations and our hope that it will mark the beginning of increased cooperation and understanding between them in such a manner as to contribute to laying the necessary foundations for attaining the hopes of their one people.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly convenes in the midst of many immense global changes. Events are accelerating at such whirlwind pace that merely keeping pace with them, let alone exploring their nature or absorbing their significance, has become extremely difficult. The big question to ponder, however, is whether such events indicate a return to previous periods in this century, when differences and disputes between States over borders and conflicting interests led to two destructive world wars. Or could they perhaps be harbingers of the dawn of a genuine opportunity for the emergence of a new world order and a new era of constructive international cooperation in solving all remaining problems throughout the world and of addressing, in a just and even-handed manner, any potentially explosive problems as soon as they appear?\nWe in Jordan see the positive in these developments and look through them towards a better future for this world. The disappearance of the intense rivalry between the two super-Powers, now replaced by dialogue and cooperation, has led to solutions to certain global problems, such as the independence of Namibia, and to easing aggravating conditions in others, as in the Western Sahara, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Central America and South Africa. This raises our hopes that those problems will be settled, peacefully and definitively, in the near future. Moreover, considerable progress has been achieved on the question of curbing the nuclear-arms race and efforts to reduce the numbers of existing weapons, especially by the two super-Powers.\nThe emergence of the present movement towards establishing a new world order - the outlines of which are beginning to take shape - demands that we all examine it in depth so as to determine the substance of this new order, its basic features and the objectives envisaged for it, and thus arrive at new ideas and plans commensurable with the challenges that such an order would pose or face. \nThe challenges facing the world today, whether in the fields of the environment, armaments or the economy, have acquired a universal nature affecting mankind as a whole and not just one particular region. The meltdown of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor and the severe damage sustained by the environment in the Gulf region are but two vivid examples of this. Proceeding from a profound belief in the collective international responsibility for confronting the dangers that threaten or encompass the environment, and driven by the desire to ensure that joint efforts be directed towards preventing the exploitation of the environment for harmful purposes, Jordan has requested the inclusion of an item on the session's agenda calling for the implementation of effective measures to prevent the exploitation of the environment for military purposes. My country hopes that by opening this important humanitarian subject for discussion it might be possible to arrive at new ideas paving the way for more effective action to prevent the exploitation of the environment - which is the property of all mankind - now and in the future, in any way or form and in any circumstances, for military purposes. In 1977, agreement was reached on concluding a Convention to prevent such acts. However, the environmental disaster in the Gulf proves that those arrangements were insufficient and demonstrates the urgent need for measures that are comprehensive in scope and more potent in effect.\nOnly recently has the world begun to pay any serious attention to the true nature of the damage sustained by the atmosphere enveloping our globe as a result of the discharge of the noxious by-products of scientific and industrial progress into it, and to the effect this has had on the world's climate. The world has also begun to be aware of the true damage to the earth's environment as a result of the development requirements of some States.\nThus, the sense that threats to the environment are a matter of concern to all mankind, and the recognition that any one State - no matter how strong or scientifically advanced - cannot deal with such threats alone, has led to the convening of important international conferences to address the various aspects of this issue. At some of these conferences Heads of State from all over the world participated in their deliberations. One such meeting was the 1989 Hague Conference in which 25 monarchs and Heads of State or Government participated, including His Majesty King Hussein. Another was the second Conference on the Climate, held in Geneva in November 1990, in which His Majesty King Hussein also participated.\nWe are looking forward to the first International Conference on the Environment and Development, which the United Nations will convene in Brazil in 1992, and consider it a test of humanity's ability to work in concert to lay the foundations for the protection of the environment and to strike a balance between the requirements of development and the preservation of the environment.\nPreserving the environment, we believe, is intrinsically related to disarmament at the global and regional levels, in particular to weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, chemical or bacteriological. For how can one objectively think of preserving the environment when one knows full well that the weapons of the two super-Powers alone are enough to destroy the whole world many times over? How can the world afford the financial resources necessary for preserving the environment and striking the necessary balance between development requirements and environmental conservation when billions upon billions of dollars are wasted each year on a rabid arms race between various States?\nIt is from this standpoint that my country welcomed the agreements recently reached between the United States of America and the Soviet Union to eliminate some weapons of mass destruction and to reduce greatly the numbers of others. These agreements represent important initial steps towards realising the loftier goal of diverting the arms race in the direction of the complete elimination of such weapons, transforming the tools of warfare, which mankind manufactures to destroy itself, into productive work-tools and channelling the resources earmarked for weapons production towards other human purposes better suited for the future of mankind as a whole.\nJordan, which in the past readily signed all agreements on the non-proliferation of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, will be pleased to participate again in any conference or activities aimed at concluding more of such instruments. It also welcomes the move by a number of States that had not previously signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to do so, and hopes that this trend will include all States that had not yet signed.\nIn this respect, it should be stated that Jordan welcomes the recent initiative of President George Bush to reduce unilaterally the large number of United States nuclear weapons, a move that was warmly received internationally. We earnestly hope that this initiative will be met by similar reductions on the part of other nuclear-weapon States.\nThe ever widening economic gap between developing and industrialized States remains the most serious threat to world peace. While the industrialized States have attained a level of development and progress that enables them to turn their attention to highly technical and scientific matters, most developing States are barely able to ensure hand-to-mouth subsistence levels for their peoples; that prevents them from participating in the harvest of the fruits of mankind's progress and advancement. Thus there is an urgent need to reopen the door to serious, constructive dialogue between the North and the South with a view to adopting effective, innovative measures that would narrow the gap, enable developing States to use modern technology to develop their economies and their human resources, and facilitate access by their products to international markets in such a way as to promote the development of those products. Failure to address the subject with the seriousness it deserves would threaten social upheaval in many countries, accompanied in most cases by dangerous military flare-ups and all the extremism that comes with hunger and deprivation.\nThe steps recently taken by several industrialized States to cancel or reduce debts incurred by some developing States deserve encouragement. This practice should be more widespread in order to alleviate the heavy debt burden of developing countries and enable them to channel their available resources to genuine self-development. In that regard, it could become necessary to establish new ground rules for loans and assistance to developing States by making them synchronous with the progress recipient States achieve in development.\nPreservation of the environment, disarmament and development all fall under the heading of preserving the right of mankind as a whole to a world in which it can lead a decent life. The progress today's generation makes in that area will determine the quality of the planet we shall bequeath to future generations.\nOur preoccupation with following the important developments now taking place in the world, inevitably brings us back to the problems of our region, the Middle East, and how they are affected by such developments. Like the rest of the world, the Middle East now stands at a major turning-point in its history. The general feeling is that there is a good opportunity - which might not return in the future - to achieve, with the cooperation of all the parties concerned, a just and lasting peace in the region, a peace that would include the solution of all the region's problems, foremost among which is the question of Palestine.\nSince 1967, Jordan has been in the forefront of those calling for a peaceful, comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the principle of international legality as represented by the United Nations. We have pursued that goal earnestly and honestly. Jordan has also responded favourably to all peace initiatives on this matter submitted since 1967 by parties from outside the region, including the United Nations.\nConsistent with that policy, my country welcomed the initiative outlined by the United States President George Bush in his statement to the United States Congress on 6 March 1991, in which he reiterated his country's policy on solving the problems of the region, proclaiming that\n\\\"A comprehensive peace must be grounded in United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of territory for peace. This principle must be elaborated to provide for Israel's security and recognition, and at the same time for legitimate Palestinian political rights. The time has come to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict\\\". That trend has been bolstered by the untiring efforts of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, during his many visits to the region, and by his continuous contacts with the parties involved in the conflict, including the Palestinian side. This led to the call for convening a peace conference this month in which all parties concerned in the region will participate. The conference will be held under the auspices of the two super-Powers - the United States and the Soviet Union - and with the participation of the European Community, the United Nations and other Arab States.\nJordan, which pioneered the call for a peace conference to find a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the area, finds acceptable, in principle, the formula being prepared for convening the sought-after peace conference, because that formula includes the main elements for which Jordan has been calling, particularly the following: reference to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973); the principle of land for peace; the mutual recognition of the right of States to live in peace; and the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people.\nJordan has unequivocally insisted on the right of the Palestinians to participate in the conference through representatives they have freely nominated. It has also accepted a formula for Palestinian participation through a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, should the Palestinian side agree, provided that dealing with the Palestinian-Israeli dimension of the problem be restricted to the Palestinians and the Israelis while the Jordanian side would address the Jordanian-Israeli dimension.\nJordan is ready to participate seriously and earnestly in the peace process aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement in the region because it recognises the benefits of peace and the dangers of the existing state of no-war-no-peace.\nAs it participates in the peace process, Jordan is aware too that a peaceful solution must be based on justice. In our view, that justice - as eventually accepted through the peace conference by all the parties involved in the conflict - must be the mainstay and guarantor of peace if we truly want that peace to endure. The Arab side in general and the Palestinian side in particular, as expressed in the recent resolutions of the Palestine National Council, have agreed to give peace in our region a chance by keeping the present window of hope wide open, and to give the emerging new world order room for hope that this will quickly lead to comprehensive world peace.\nBut we and the rest of the world are waiting to see whether the present leaders of Israel are equally ready to achieve the desired peaceful solution or whether they prefer to remain prisoners of their own intransigence, thus killing the chances of peace for their people and for the region as a whole.\nJordan considers that the best measure of Israel's seriousness towards the peace process would be an end to Israel's illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Al-Quds and the Golan. Such activities not only contravene international conventions but, if they continue in their present form, will also destroy an essential element in the peace formula.\nProceeding from its devotion to peace in the region, Jordan supported the efforts aimed at making the Middle East a some free of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, chemical, biological or other weapons. To be able to achieve this, it is the view of my country that it should begin with the signing of, and adherence to, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, by all States of the region which have not done so yet, particularly Israel, in preparation for arriving, during the peace conference, at agreements to start ridding the region of such weapons in a general and comprehensive manner, as well as proceeding to reduce conventional weapons.\nJordan has suffered, and continues to suffer, from the consequences of the painful events that took place in the Gulf, from the start of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait to the ensuing destructive war, the effects of which are still being endured by both the Iraqi and Kuwaiti peoples, in addition to large numbers of other Arabs and non-Arabs.\nThe position of my country with respect to these events had been clear from the outset. It was elaborated in the statement delivered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jordan in the Assembly on 26 September 1990, in which he said:\n\\\"Jordan, as a civilized country that respects its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, does not and cannot approve of the resort to force as a way of solving differences between States, nor does it accept the occupation of the territory of others, nor does it support or recognize any demographic or political changes resulting from war in our area or anywhere else in the world. Therefore, Jordan did not recognize the decision to annex Kuwait. Jordan has called and continues to call for the restoration of legitimacy in this Arab country ...\\\". (A/45/PV.8 . p. 77)\nBased on this, my country sought hard to find a peaceful solution to the problem within the framework of joint Arab action before matters reached the point of the use of force.\nMoreover, my country declared its unequivocal adherence to all United Nations resolutions on the subject, especially Security Council resolution 661 (1990), although implementation of that resolution led to the infliction of heavy damage on the economy of Jordan and the livelihoods of its citizens. Adding to those difficulties and burdens was the influx of large numbers of its citizens working in Iraq and Kuwait - more than 250,000 - who had fled the crisis. Even after the ending of the major crisis, Jordan still receives large numbers of Jordanians and Palestinian nationals who are forced to leave Kuwait. My country is seeking the help of the competent international bodies to provide it with the necessary aid for absorbing those returnees who had lost their livelihood and income and returned to Jordan empty-handed, as well as for enabling them to regain stable lives and find new means of livelihood, under increasingly difficult economic conditions caused by the sudden influx of such a large number of persons.\nAt the same time, Jordan is deeply distressed by the harsh living conditions the Iraqi people are now enduring as a consequence of the war in the Gulf, and by the possibility of a real famine befalling the Iraqis if the present situation continues, as well as by the death of large numbers of children because of shortages of necessary medicines and food, not to mention outbreaks of epidemics due to shortages in the means of sterilization, water purification and other basic sanitary services. The reports by His Highness Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the Executive Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance in the Middle East, and those by other humanitarian societies active in Iraq, gave a painful description of the true state of the present living conditions in Iraq and of what is expected to happen if human conditions there continue to deteriorate. My country feels that any political consideration pales and retreats, indeed fades away and disappears altogether when measured against the reality of human pain and suffering. Jordan, therefore, calls for speedy action to take the necessary measures to lift the economic blockade against the Iraqi people to enable them to overcome the sorrowful inhuman conditions they are suffering.\nMy country also wishes to reiterate its keen interest in preserving the unity of Iraq and its sovereignty over its territory, and considers that to be an important element in the maintenance of stability in the region as a whole.\nAs for sisterly Lebanon, my country joins its fraternal people in their joy over the end of the ruinous civil war, which devastated the country for nearly 15 years, and over the success of the legitimate authority there in restoring its sovereignty over most of the Lebanese territory. We also hope that this success will continue so that Lebanon can regain its full sovereignty over its whole national soil. We call upon the world Organization to support Lebanon in its efforts to implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and other resolutions stipulating the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories it controls in southern Lebanon.\nMy country wishes to renew the expression of its full commitment to, and support of, this great Organization and its complete concern in seeing it continue to perform its work, to the best of its ability, for the good of all humanity. In this context, Jordan reaffirms its support for the efforts aimed at developing the work of the Organization and introducing the appropriate improvements and amendments to contribute to its increased efficiency and\nensure the performance of its duties in an objective, fair and efficient manner, so as to preserve its fundamental role as an Organisation established to realise mankind's eternal dream to avoid the scourge of war and preserve international peace and security.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me start, Sir, by expressing the Swedish Government's deep satisfaction at your election as President for this session of the General Assembly and at the election of the Vice-Presidents. I would also like to convey to the Secretary-General our great appreciation of his devoted efforts over the past 10 years to achieve peace and a stronger United Nations.\nToday it is more evident than ever before that humanity is facing challenges and problems of a global nature. The problems are global and must be dealt with globally. Interdependence is the main difference between our modern world and that of previous generations. This is why foreign policy today is more a question of how States act in relation to common problems than how they act towards each other.\nIn this world of interdependence our global Organization, the United Nations, is an indispensable tool for cooperation. Sweden's commitment to the United Nations, and to all that the Charter stands for, remains a cornerstone of our foreign policy.\nThe clearest example of interdependence can be found in the environmental sphere. If development is to be possible, the life-sustaining ecological systems must be preserved. At the same time, development is necessary if it is to be possible to safeguard the environment. Development must improve the living conditions of the poor so that they are not forced to destroy the ecological basis for their children's future. Development must also mean that people and countries which enjoy a high standard of living significantly reduce the burden which they impose on the environment. The developing countries need to mobilize their resources, but they also need the transfer of new, additional resources from the industrialized world.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will be convened in Bio de Janeiro in about eight months' time. We expect that the two conventions on climate change and biological diversity will be effective instruments. We want the Conference to adopt a detailed work programme for the years ahead, indicating clearly the tasks to be undertaken by Governments and organizations to implement the measures agreed upon. We also expect to see an increasing willingness on the part of Governments to solve the problems of financing.\nThe globalisation of vital questions can also be seen in the way in which human rights are perceived. The United Nations is playing an increasingly important role in the defence of human rights in all countries. This role has to be further developed, and the mechanisms created to monitor respect for human rights have to be strengthened. We have often witnessed serious violations of human rights in connection with war or national unrest. Working for respect for fundamental human rights in all countries is an important aspect of efforts to achieve international peace and security.\nThe multilateral disarmament efforts of the United Nations continue to be among the essential tasks of the Organization, even though important disarmament decisions have been taken unilaterally by the super-Powers or bilaterally in agreements between them.\nAs regards one of the questions affecting the destiny of the world - the threat of a war involving nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction - 1991 stands out as a memorable year. For the first time we now have an agreement to reduce the arsenals of strategic weapons.\nIt is a particular pleasure for me to welcome three neighbouring States as Members of the United Nations. The three Baltic States - Estonia. Latvia and Lithuania - have regained their independence and have rapidly received wide international recognition. The Swedish people have been deeply and actively committed to the Baltic peoples' struggle for freedom. We will continue to give our support to the reconstruction of their societies.\nThe admission of the two Korean States to the United Nations marks an important step on a road which, we hope, will lead to reunification in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people. I welcome them to the United Nations, together with Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.\nEurope has truly experienced a revolution of liberty. Hew conditions and opportunities have opened up for a Europe that has rid itself of the nightmare of totalitarianism and the cold war.\nAt the historic Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) summit meeting in Paris almost a year ago all the participating States undertook to build, consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of government of their nations. They also pledged themselves to promote economic liberty based on the principles of the market economy.\nThe CSCE's possibilities of tangibly contributing to the realization of the high aims of the Charter of Paris have been strengthened in the last year by the establishment of a crisis mechanism and through the recently concluded CSCE meeting in Moscow on the human dimension.\nSweden warmly welcomes this development in Europe. We would like to participate wholeheartedly in building a new Europe, and are ready to accept our share of the common European responsibility in accordance with the goals of the Paris Charter.\nThe European Community constitutes the central powerful force in the emerging new Europe. The Community is living proof that purposeful cooperation between States can lead to new and dynamic ways of working together and at the same time can relegate traditional tensions to the history books.\nSweden's wish to become a member of the European Community is an expression of our desire to participate in the Community's endeavours to pave the way for new forms of cooperation within the Community and in Europe - a Europe open to the outside world. He are ready to shoulder our part of this responsibility.\nThe relationship between freedom, democracy and a market economy on the one hand and peace and stability on the other is not only applicable to Europe. This is why the democratic developments which we have seen in so many parts of the world, particularly in the latter half of the 1980s, are so promising. He can witness promising developments in many parts of Africa. And this past decade saw a return to democracy in Latin America. Cuba is one tragic exception. All over the world demands for democracy have become a powerful force. We are convinced that in the long run these demands will prevail. I would like to believe that this will also apply to Haiti. The illegal action against the democratically elected President is unacceptable.\nSweden strongly supports the international trend towards democracy. This is in full conformity with the purposes for which the United Nations was created.\nFree trade is of primary importance for growth in all countries. The efforts to create prosperity through open and free economic relations must succeed. The process towards prosperity, in turn, is a prerequisite for an international development towards peace and democracy.\nThere is a growing awareness of the possibilities that free trade and market solutions also offer for the development of the poorer countries. The social consequences of development policies must never be overlooked. At the same time, it is essential that both the economic policies of the developing countries and the focus and orientation of development assistance take advantage of the opportunities offered by market forces.\nThe three States in Central Europe which are known as the reform States - Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary - are now implementing the principles of democracy, the rule of law and the market, economy. In the Soviet Union dramatic upheavals have taken place. The process of democratisation, which is also crucially important for the world community, was threatened for a few days in August. But the coup failed. The democratic forces were victorious. All the people who contributed to this outcome have earned our gratitude and respect.\nWith the democratisation of Central and Eastern Europe, old, artificial barriers have been demolished. We now bear a joint responsibility to prevent the erection of new barriers. The new democracies must not be excluded from the closer cooperation, whether political, economic or in some other form, which is already being realized in western Europe. \nIn different ways - bilaterally and in cooperation with other countries - Sweden has tried to support the transition to democratic systems. This commitment stands firm. I should like to underline that the efforts of the Swedish Government in Europe will not affect our assistance to other parts of the world. Sweden will live up to its international commitments regarding development assistance. The allocation of 1 per cent of our gross national income - which we have maintained for many years - stands firm.\nWe have witnessed terrible bloodshed in Yugoslavia. Recently the army, apparently without political direction, has used brutal force against sections of the population. Sweden views developments in Yugoslavia with the utmost concern and urgently calls on the parties involved to refrain immediately from all acts of violence. Sweden supports and is participating in the efforts, which are being made through the CSCE and the European Community to achieve peace. The international community cannot accept the use of force to change internal and external borders. Any solution must guarantee the rights of minorities in all republics. Sweden welcomes the resolution adopted by the Security Council on 25 September as one step in the international community's endeavours to contribute to a solution of the question of the future of Yugoslavia by peaceful means.\nThe historic Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the recently announced unilateral disarmament decisions by the United States and the Soviet Union are very important steps towards lower levels of armaments and greater security. It is also important for naval tactical nuclear weapons and cruise missiles to be withdrawn and not normally to be deployed on surface vessels and attack submarines. For many years Sweden has stressed the risks associated with these weapons. \nFollowing on from the American initiative, the Soviet Union recently announced corresponding measures. In addition. President Gorbachev has proposed further reductions of the strategic arsenals beyond the commitments in the START Treaty and has announced a unilateral Soviet test ban for the coming year.\nThese latest measures by the United States and the Soviet Union reinforce the image of 1991 as a historic year of disarmament. It is very encouraging that the two leading nuclear Powers are demonstrating their special responsibility in this way.\nNon-proliferation has been the focus of global attention since the Gulf war. Since then important initiatives have been taken regarding both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction. It is my hope that not only 1991, but the next few years also will be marked by the achievement of a more effective control of biological weapons, the speedy conclusion and implementation of the chemical weapons convention as well as the restricted transfer of conventional weapons.\nOver the last few decades, several United Nations studies have pointed to the enormous and onerous costs associated with armaments. This has been the case both for nuclear-weapon policy and for conventional armaments in all parts of the world. The weapons have become increasingly sophisticated, ever more costly and with greater destructive power. In this memorable year for disarmament I express the hope that these economic resources will be made available for human development and mutual trust.\nLast year much of the world's attention was focused on the situation in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East. Iraq's brutal aggression against its neighbour Kuwait was a flagrant violation of international law and bad, unfortunately, to be reversed by military means. Those countries - with the United States in the forefront - which carried out this task on behalf of the international community deserve our recognition and respect. That conflict involved much suffering for the people of Iraq, in common with many others. The material destruction has been enormous. For a long time to come the environment in this area will bear the mark of the meaningless destruction wrought by Iraq.\nThe aggression unleashed by Saddam Hussein has also turned the attention of the international community to the exposed position of the Kurds. The brutal violence to which that ethnic group has been subjected is unacceptable, as is the violence directed against other parts of the population.\nThe Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait has been the international community's first serious test since the cold war. It was a unique case of aggression perpetrated by one United Nations Member against another. The United Rations acted swiftly and took coercive measures against Iraq on the basis of Chapter VII of the Charter. In the long-term interests of peace and security it is of crucial importance that aggression should not pay and that potential violators should be prevented from committing crimes against international law.\nThe events of the past year have not diminished the urgency of the Palestinian question which is the most difficult issue to solve in this part of the world. A solution of this conflict must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 {1967} and 338 (1973) and the implied principle of land for peace. Israelis and Palestinians must recognise each other's right to peaceful coexistence. Israel must have the right to exist within secure and internationally recognised borders. The Palestinians' right to self-determination, including their right to form a State of their own. must be accepted by Israel.\nThe Swedish Government strongly supports the efforts of the United States to bring about a Middle East peace conference. It is essential that the international community should be able to follow the conference through the presence of a United Nations representative.\nThis conference could be the start of a process which, if successful, would lead to a solution of both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Arab-Israeli dispute. There are many obstacles along the way. One is the settlement policy. It is of the utmost importance that all parties demonstrate maximum restraint and a willingness to compromise.\nRecently the resolution which equated Zionism with racism again became a topical issue. Sweden's attitude is well known. We voted against the resolution and condemned it in the strongest terms. Our attitude to the resolution is the same today as it was in 1975. The revocation of this resolution should constitute a confidence-building step towards the peaceful settlement which we now hope is under way.\nIn South Africa the most important racial laws of the apartheid system have already been abolished. The next step will be to introduce a democratic form of government with votes for all, irrespective of race. Negotiations to this end are approaching rapidly. The difficulties - above all in the form of the violence which is now afflicting many of the black townships - should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, a historic process has been initiated. We look forward to the day when the question of apartheid can be deleted from the United Nations agenda.\nSweden continues to support the work against apartheid. The Swedish Government hopes that developments will soon make it possible for Sweden to lift its sanctions against South Africa.\nThere are still several conflicts around the world that remain on the international agenda, namely Cambodia, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Western Sahara, Central America and Cyprus. The common denominator in all these conflicts is that the role of the United Nations - as different as it may be depending on the nature of the conflict - is crucial for progress towards a final solution.\nThe world Organisation is facing a period of new demands and expectations. Sweden is participating actively in the current discussions about the United Nations and its future role.\nAn important lesson that can be drawn from the crisis in the Persian Gulf is that the United Nations must place a special emphasis on preventive diplomacy, as well as the strengthening of its capacity to respond to emergencies. Careful consideration should be given to how, in more concrete terms, the United Nations capabilities in the area of preventive diplomacy can be strengthened. The ability to identify threatening situations and intervene at an early stage should be improved. Japan, among others, has put forward valuable proposals in this regard.\nIn the new, changing political situation, opportunities have increased for a constructive interaction between an active Security Council and the Secretary-General. In order to give the Secretary-General the necessary support in the role the Charter confers upon him, it is evident - as he himself points out in his annual report - that more resources are needed.\nWhen emergencies occur, the United Nations must be able to act quickly, efficiently and in a coordinated manner. The preparedness of the relevant United Nations organs must be improved, as well as the coordinating mechanisms. But the United Nations and its organs can act only if the Member States give it sufficient and flexible resources.\nSweden welcomes the reform programme that was adopted earlier this year in the economic and social field. It is clear, however, that it is not enough to confine reform to the Economic and Social Council itself. We attach considerable importance to the review to be undertaken of subsidiary bodies and of the division of labour between the Council and the General Assembly.\nIn May the final report of the Nordic countries' United Nations Project was submitted to the Secretary-General. This report summarizes reform proposals in the economic and social area, involving such questions as the opportunity and ability of Member States to govern the operational activities of the United Rations system, as well as the possibility of devising a more adequate financing system for these activities. The Nordic countries are now aiming at establishing a broad basis of support among Member States for continued constructive reform of the United Nations in this field. We consider the high-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council scheduled for next summer to be an appropriate occasion for an in-depth, substantive discussion of these questions.\nIn the past year, important discussions on possible reforms in a number of different areas have been initiated. They involve economic and social activities, peace-keeping operations, emergency relief, the work of the General Assembly and forms of cooperation within the United Nations system. The reorganization of the Secretariat is a priority item. Interesting proposals have also been put forward by independent groups and influential individuals, for example in the so-called Stockholm Initiative.\nIn today's favourable climate for international cooperation, the Member States are giving to the United Nations a number of tasks that put heavy demands on resources. It is highly ironic and unacceptable that the United Nations is still forced to conduct its operations under the shadow of a continuing financial crisis. It should be a question of honour for every Member State to fulfil its obligations under the Charter in a timely manner.\nThe developing countries must be principally responsible for their own economic and social development. But, at the same time, it is in the interest of the industrialized world actively to assist in the process towards a more just world. The debt crisis has not yet been overcome. In particular, the poorest countries need substantial debt-relief measures. We urge all member States of the Paris Club to contribute actively to an agreement on substantial debt reduction.\nResources for development assistance must be expanded. It is deeply unsatisfactory that the industrialised countries have not managed to meet, the United Nations target for development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross national product, despite a decade of relatively high growth in the industrialized world and growing needs of the developing countries. Stagnating resource flows are a short-sighted strategy in a world that is increasingly characterized by the interdependence of nations. Thus, we have a common interest to ensure that this long-accepted target is reached.\nThe end of the cold war gives the United Nations a historic opportunity for action. A new outlook can be developed in international politics. The world is no longer a geopolitical chess-board, with States as pawns in a game. Rather, it is a congress of nations, where all people are equally entitled to political freedom, economic and social justice, a healthy environment and full human rights. This means a positive challenge. Our cooperation in the United Nations is based on respect for national sovereignty. At the same time, there is a growing awareness that the United Nations must also bear its share of responsibility for developments that directly affect the inhabitants of our societies. A balance has to be struck between the requirements of sovereignty and those of solidarity.\nBoth the demands of justice and enlightened self-interest lead us to the same conclusion: we need a strong United Nations at a time of growing interdependence and global challenges. Let us get down to work.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, I am pleased to join those who have already congratulated you on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your vast experience of United Nations affairs and your consummate diplomatic skills give us every confidence that you will discharge your responsibilities with distinction.\nI note with pleasure the enhanced representation of the Pacific subregion in the United Nations. The States of the Pacific and the Caribbean, although divided by geography, are close and constant partners, in this forum and others, in the search for solutions to the unique challenges confronting small island developing nations. Our shared experiences, perspectives and aspirations contribute a special dimension to the dialogue between the community of nations. Barbados is therefore delighted to offer a fraternal welcome to the new Member States of the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.\nIt is also of particular significance for my delegation that today, in furtherance of the principles of universality of membership, we welcome into the United Nations family the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. We look forward to their active contribution to the work of the Organization and hope, in turn, that within the supportive framework of the United Nations they will find a means of building bridges towards a common future.\nWe also take pleasure in welcoming the republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and salute the restoration of their sovereignty.\nMay I also take this opportunity to endorse the tributes paid to your distinguished predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco. We commend him for his innovative use of the presidency as a catalyst for promoting dialogue on ways to revitalise and enhance the effectiveness of the General Assembly. We are confident, Sir, that under your able leadership dialogue will be constructively advanced throughout the coming months.\nBarbados also congratulates its regional compatriot, His excellence Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his careful stewardship of the Organisation over this complex and unprecedented period of its history. The unassuming brand of diplomacy of the Secretary-General and his high-level team has contributed significantly to the recent progress in many of the hitherto intractable problems confronting the United Nations.\nNow, at this critical juncture in international relations, the choice of a new Secretary-General is naturally of vital relevance to us all. The person we choose must be a leader capable of preserving the independence and integrity of the post, a mediator capable of maintaining a healthy balance among the competing interests represented within the Organisation and a committed activist who will inspire universal confidence in the ability of the United Nations to fulfil decisively and impartially the vital functions prescribed for it in the Charter. In making the selection due regard must also be given, in my delegation's view, to the principle of rotation.\nThe momentous developments of the past two years have brought profound and irreversible change to the conduct of relations among nations. The death of the cold war - and with it the rapid disappearance of the Ideological divide - has occasioned a remarkable assembly of new partners, concrete prospects for disarmament, expectations of trickle-down benefits of the so-called peace dividend and confident pronouncements that a new world order is at hand. The euphoria, however, has been short lived. War and devastation in the Persian Gulf and the recent dramatic internal disintegration of an empire in the east are poignant reminders of the difficult adjustments that lie ahead in a world devoid of the familiar status quo.\nRecent developments in the Soviet Union and the reaction of the international community to those developments show the extent to which old enmities and suspicions have receded and the concept of global interdependence has taken hold. On 19 August 1991 the Government of Barbados publicly condemned as unconstitutional and undemocratic the attempt to remove the legitimate President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from office by force. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) did likewise. The people of Barbados were moved by the courage and dignity with which the Soviet people successfully withstood this dangerous threat and they stand ready, with the international community, to support them in whatever forms of peaceful association they may freely choose for themselves.\nWe are, however, deeply concerned over the breakdown of civil order and the outbreak of armed conflict in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We urge all parties to the conflict to pursue their goals through peaceful means and to support the peacemaking efforts of the European Community.\nThe Gulf War was a tragedy, not only for the innocent people of Iraq and Kuwait, but also for the international community as a whole. It provided a chilling reminder of the extent to which the unfettered ambition of even a single individual can sometimes destroy overnight the fragile and uncertain world peace for which this Organization strives. It was of vital importance that the United Nations should act in this far-reaching crisis to demonstrate unambiguously that naked aggression has no place in the modern world and that every State, no matter how small or militarily insignificant, has the sovereign right to exist in peace and security.\nThe results of the encounter in the Gulf are not, however, in my delegation's view, cause for triumphant celebration. They are an occasion, rather, for sober reflection on the enormous human consequences of war and on the ways in which we can work together to eradicate the conditions for its recurrence.\nForty years of cold-war polarization within the United Nations have effectively prevented us from putting into place, under Article 43 of the Charter, the contingency provisions necessary for collective United Nations enforcement action under the direction of the Security Council.\nThe Gulf crisis stands as the first post-cold-war test of the application of the principle of collective security. The case of Kuwait is sui generis, and the ad hoc coalition of interests that responded is unlikely to recur in the face of other breaches of the peace. The new spirit of cooperation among the five permanent members brings with it the prospect of a revitalised Security Council, finally capable of carrying out its far-reaching responsibilities under the Charter. It is therefore necessary to put at the Council's disposal the permanent enforcement tools needed to deter and, in the last resort, counter aggression. Ad hoc mechanisms are of uncertain comfort to small, resource-poor States like my own, which look to the United Nations as the only impartial guarantor of their security. Greater impetus must also be given to strengthening the capabilities of the Security Council and of the Secretary-General in the prevention and resolution of conflicts.\nCare must also be taken to balance the powers and responsibilities of the Security Council through genuine consultation and involvement of the wider United Nations membership. Indeed, the Secretary-General stressed in the 1990 Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization that\n\\\"agreement among the major Powers must carry with it the support of a majority of Member States if it is to make the desired impact on the world situation. It is the willing endorsement of the decisions of the Security Council by the international community that can best counter any impression, likely to create anxiety, of world affairs being run by a directorate\\\". (A/45/1, p. 13)\nThe end of cold-war tensions provides a historic opportunity for United Nations diplomacy to focus on bringing lasting peace to the remaining areas of regional conflict. Barbados is heartened by the tentative steps taken in this regard in the Middle East. We fully support the holding of an international conference, with the participation of all the parties concerned, aimed at achieving a just settlement that respects both the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and that of Israel to live in peace and security within recognized borders.\nBarbados further notes the significant progress made in the arduous process towards a lasting Cambodian peace and the pivotal role required of the United Nations in the implementation of the final peace agreement. The United Nations efforts in facilitating the process towards peaceful settlement in Western Sahara deserve similar recognition and support from Member States.\nIn our region, Barbados welcomes the normalization of relations between Belize and Guatemala and the historic moves towards a negotiated solution to any outstanding differences. A relaxation of tensions between these two neighbours will contribute enormously to strengthening relations between Central America and the Caribbean Community. Concrete steps have already been taken towards this end and I look forward to the inauguration, next month in Honduras, of what I hope will be a process of regular ministerial dialogue and cooperation between Central America and CABICOM.\nWe are likewise heartened by the recent breakthrough in negotiations between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and the signing of the New York agreement on 25 September 1991, which offer the first real prospects for the realization of a definitive and lasting peace in that troubled country.\nIt is our earnest hope that a spirit of conciliation, dialogue and good-neighbourliness will be brought to bear on remaining tensions between countries in our hemisphere. \nWithin this general atmosphere of progress and optimism, leaf week's events In Haiti stand out as an anachronistic blot upon the regional landscape, The Member States of the Caribbean Community were intimately involved in the regional and international efforts to assist the electoral and democratisation process In Haiti and are outraged at the crude and callous attempts to thwart the will of the Haitian people. Barbados will have no dealings with the usurpers In Port au-Prince and fully supports the actions taken by the Organisation of American States aimed at reversing the coup and restoring the legitimate government of Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office. It is imperative that the United Nations act in concert to ensure the success of the regional effort.\nGenuine and complete disarmament is an indispensable element for consolidating peace. Barbados welcomes the important initiatives recently announced by the Governments of the United States and the USSR with regard to nuclear disarmament and hopes that these will provide momentum for real progress in this vital area. He also fully support the renewed interest of the international community in creating a regime for the prohibition of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My country, Barbados, stands ready to forswear their use in perpetuity.\nThe international community must permit the United Nations a more active role in ensuring that disarmament gains in some parts of the world are not offset by spiralling arms races in others. Barbados is convinced of the vital need for transparency in the sale and transfer of weapons and supports the creation and maintenance of the appropriate register under United Nations auspices. Regional and subregional security arrangements should be actively encouraged under the umbrella of the Charter. \nSince 1982, countries in the Eastern Caribbean have participated in a regional security system of our own. As vulnerable micro-States, we are persuaded that increased militarisation to counter a potential external aggressor does little to enhance national security, but carries instead its own potential for internal destabilisation. We have therefore opted for an arrangement that combines a minimal internal force with a joint rapid-response capability to deal with any threat in any one of the participating territories. The resources of the system are channelled when needed to other areas of functional cooperation, including drug interdiction and disaster relief.\nThere is interest in expanding the system to include other territories of the Caribbean Community, and a committee, which I have the honour to chair, is actively pursuing the matter. This Caribbean initiative is consistent with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter, and we are confident that it will now enjoy the full support of a revitalized Security Council.\nThe issue of apartheid is one of the continuing concerns of my delegation. While we are encouraged by the advances noted in the Secretary-General's second progress report on the implementation of the Declaration on Apartheid and its destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, we are greatly concerned about the violence that has obstructed the political dialogue so vital to the achievement of non-racial democracy in South Africa. We therefore fervently hope that the Johannesburg peace agreement signed on 14 September 1991 will ensure an environment of trust and security in which the proposed multi-party conference can proceed.\nIn this context, Barbados supports the view expressed in the Abuja Declaration of 29 July 1991 that negotiation leading to the drawing up and adoption of a non-racial and democratic constitution is now the most urgent and pressing question.\nWe firmly believe that the international community should continue to exert pressure on the Pretoria regime through the maintenance of financial and economic sanctions until there is evidence of profound and irreversible change leading to a non-racial democracy in South Africa. Only partial steps towards that goal have so far been taken. Let us resolve to stay the course until apartheid, that crime against humanity, is no more.\nMany voices have proclaimed a new world order. Few, however, have defined it. For the delegation of Barbados, that definition must go beyond purely military or political concepts. In the past few years we have witnessed dramatic progress towards the universal attainment of human freedom. But freedom cannot translate into lasting peace in a world where hundreds of millions still live in utter poverty and deprivation, and where 23 per cent of the world's population enjoys 85 per cent of the world's wealth. A new world order must be based on social justice and afford all people the opportunity to benefit from the development of the resources of this planet. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of any real prospect of enlightened action in this regard. On the contrary, the gap between North and South continues to grow.\nFor developing countries to earn their way in the brave new world of the 1990s and beyond, urgent steps must taken genuinely to liberalize trade, to alleviate the debt burden and to reverse the net outflow of resources from South to North. It is essential that the Uruguay Sound be speedily and successfully concluded. Further debt-relief measures, including the question of debt owed to multilateral financial institutions, must also be addressed.\nThe concept of sustainable and environmentally sound economic development has been brought sharply into focus as the United Nations prepares for the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development. All nations share, in some measure, in the environmental degradation that has beset our planet and must all work together to find solutions to this critical issue.\nIndeed, the acceptance by the developed countries of principal responsibility for global environmental pollution is a step in the right direction. Regrettably, however, acceptance has not always led to action. Some have continued to treat issues which are central to the success of the 1992 Conference as charity rather than as a collective responsibility. Simple justice demands a higher degree of political commitment than has been in evidence so far in the preparations for the 1992 Conference. We call on those countries to act responsibly in the efforts under way to launch a new era of environmentally sustainable development.\nFor my own country, the pursuit of sustainable development has been hampered by contradictory signals from the North. Barbados has always followed, without coercion, all the accepted prescriptions for development. Our society has evolved against a background of genuine representative democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, minimal military expenditure, public accountability and careful management of scarce resources in pursuit of people-oriented policies. Recognition of Barbados's comprehensive network of social services and high quality of life is clearly reflected in the 1991 human development report of the United Nations Development Programme.\nYet the irony remains that the international economic environment provides no reward for good performance. At the precise moment when it is being lauded as a model of development planning, Barbados has reached the stage where its earnings in a fiercely protected market can no longer sustain its accomplishments. For there is no supportive network to encourage middle-income developing countries towards higher stages of development. The examples around us seem to suggest that from now on it is to be a constant game of snakes and ladders.\nI referred earlier to the dialogue on General Assembly reform that is currently taking place. My delegation believes that it is important to take urgent steps to improve the efficiency and relevance of the General Assembly within the Organization's aims and purposes. However, in our eagerness to re-energize the United Nations, we must be careful not to act impulsively, without fully and carefully analysing all the implications. For we may yet find that the problem may not have been in the existing system itself but rather in the paralysis to which that system had fallen victim.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe are today In the happy position of being able to give a warm welcome to the representatives of the three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It is a particular pleasure for Denmark to welcome our neighbours on the Baltic Sea back to the international community as free and independent States. With the fully restored Independence of the Baltic States, one of the last remaining issues arising from the Second World War has finally been settled. The membership of the Baltic States is a natural continuation of their membership of the League of Nations.\nI am also very happy to welcome the new Member States of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as well as the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia,\nThe second term of office of the Secretary-General is drawing to a close. Throughout the past decade Mr. Peres de Cuellar has been untiring in his efforts to find solutions too many of the problems facing various areas of the world and the Organisation itself. He can rightfully be gratified that, at long last, many of his efforts are bearing fruit. The United Nations of today is stronger and more respected than when he assumed office 10 years ago.\nI recall with warm feelings the atmosphere in this forum one year ago. We had then experienced a year full of dramatic and historic changes sweeping through the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. He had witnessed the fall, one by one, of outdated totalitarian regimes and the resurrection of democracy and respect for human rights. These developments inspired a new optimism with regard to our future in general and to the future of this Organization in particular. Today we can look back on yet another year of dramatic developments in the Soviet Union and in central and Eastern Europe. Fortunately, the positive trend has continued. However, in August we lived through \\\"three days that shook the world\\\". The putsch in Moscow sparked off a global shock. As in a nightmare, we imagined the return to totalitarianism and the cold war. All the more heartening was the awakening to the rejection of this development by the force of a people that will no longer accept oppression.\nThose of us in Western Europe who after the Second World War had the opportunity to develop our democracies in freedom have now a special obligation to support the new democracies in their struggle to establish a solid foundation for their freedom. This we cannot do merely by declarations. We must provide economic support and we must open our own markets. We now have a unique opportunity to create a Europe whole and free - an opportunity we must not allow to slip through our hands because of narrow-minded national selfishness threatening to turn back the clock.\nLet me add that today the Danish Government is proposing to our Parliament a plan of action covering the next few years, outlining our bilateral support for reforms in Eastern Europe, as well as our contributions to the multinational efforts, first of all through the Group of 24.\nThe new foundations for East-West relations have opened new and promising perspectives for the role of the United Nations. We come to this year's General Assembly session more confident that a genuine willingness has emerged to use the Organization as an effective instrument to resolve and prevent conflicts among nations. We come with visible proof that, when the world community is resolved to work together for peace, those who challenge the peace cannot win. The Iraqi assault on Kuwait led to hitherto inexperienced constructive cooperation in the Security Council and a collective military effort which made it clear that the world will no longer tolerate such flagrant military aggressions. For the first time in its history the United Nations system has been able to exploit to the full its potential for prevention of war and use of collective sanctions provided for in the Charter. The United Nations system has thus been allowed to play a far more active role in conflict prevention and peace-keeping. This is very encouraging for the future role of the United Nations and the establishment of a new world order.\nHowever, in welcoming this development we must remind ourselves that the strengthened role of the United Nations in resolving conflicts among nations is first and foremost a result of the rapid change in East-West relations. It means that at the present stage the United Nations is as strong as the strength and durability of the new international political climate. We must therefore seize the present favourable opportunity - while we have it - to make the Organization more effective, by implementing much-needed reforms and devising mechanisms which can make the Organization more solid, should a less favourable climate return. Therefore the reform and strengthening of the United Nations - the whole United Nations system - should be a central issue at this year's General Assembly session.\nIn the political area, the Gulf war and later developments have made it clear that there is a real need for strengthening the ability of the United Nations to act rapidly and efficiently in crisis situations. We must strengthen already existing mechanisms. Thus, the Security Council must work closely together with the General Assembly, and the Secretary-General should play a more active role in preventing conflicts and in resolving emerging crises. Furthermore, the Security Council should have stronger instruments at its disposal with regard to peace enforcement. We must consider the effectiveness of various types of sanctions; and we must clarify how military forces can be employed and especially the role of the Security Council in carrying out military action.\nDenmark has always been a firm supporter of United Nations peace-keeping operations. There certainly is a basis for increasing their role, especially in conflict prevention. A prerequisite will be a satisfactory solution with regard to the financing of the peace-keeping operations. In this respect, we strongly support the Secretary-General's proposal to increase the Working Capital Fund. We also suggest the establishment of a separate peace-keeping fund to ensure quick action when new peace-keeping operations are launched. Such a fund must be based on the collective responsibility of all Member States - that is, on assessed contributions.\nThe Gulf conflict and the associated revelations of Iraq's enormous arsenals have led to a revival of interest in international measures to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to encourage greater responsibility in the transfer of conventional arms. The world community will increasingly have to tackle excessive build-ups of arms which might threaten global and regional security. Denmark will therefore, together with our European Community partners, submit an initiative on international arms transfers during this General Assembly session.\nLasting peace can be achieved only if we tackle the growing disparities between rich and poor nations, and between rich and poor people within nations. For years we have had lengthy and unproductive debates on who is responsible for the lack of progress in developing countries. It is therefore encouraging that these debates have recently been replaced by a much more constructive dialogue, which underlines our shared responsibility. Of special importance is the growing recognition that development of democratic systems, good governance and respect for human rights are essential for ensuring sustainable development. We welcome the reforms which many countries have initiated in the economic and social areas, although they do not yet go far enough; and we are pleased that democracy and pluralism are spreading to parts of the world hitherto characterized by one-party regimes and dictatorships.\nHowever, the formal establishment of institutional structures and procedures will not suffice. The political and economic decision-making process must be based on broad public participation and in particular the active participation of women and young people. Through our own experience in Denmark we have certainly learned the importance of this.\nOver the last two decades the role of the United Nations system's operational activities in development cooperation has gradually declined, and disillusionment may lead to further erosion. There is a lack of focus in considerable parts of the system; and the system as such has often evolved in an ad hoc manner in response to temporary needs.\nThe improved international political climate provides a unique chance for radical reforms giving the United Nations programmes more focus and cohesion and increasing their contribution to economic and social development.\nDenmark has demonstrated its support for United Nations efforts in the field of development by contributing financially far more than the size of our economy would indicate. This special interest and our wish to ensure effective utilization of our contributions prompted us in 1988 to set up, together with the other Nordic countries, what is called the Nordic United Nations Project, whose final report was submitted in April this year. The project contains a number of ideas, which we hope will be considered seriously. The two main ideas of the project relate to funding and governance of United Nations programmes. The present funding mechanism might be replaced by a mechanism that improved the prospects for forward planning and greater fairness. On governance, the idea is that the present governing bodies of five United Nations organs should be replaced by a single governing body, an international development council. This would not only be a major step towards rationalisation of the governance of the United Nations development efforts, but would also provide the scope for improved coordination and coherence.\nWhile the United Nations can make an important contribution to the development of third-world countries, it cannot be a substitute for the integration of these countries into the global economy. Industrialized and developing countries have a common interest in strengthening a free and open world-trade system. Protectionist pressures must be resisted. All countries now need to make a special effort to bring the Uruguay Round negotiations to an early and successful conclusion.\nThe enhanced status and powers of the United Nations in the area of the maintenance of peace and international security should go hand in hand with an increased humanitarian profile for the Organization. Developments - in particular, those of the past year - have clearly confirmed the need for a much stronger role for the United Nations in the area of humanitarian assistance and relief operations in emergencies. The frequency, extent and complexity of recent disasters - man-made as well as natural - and the accompanying costs in terms of human suffering and loss of life should serve as a powerful impetus for action.\nAn essential aim should be to increase the effectiveness 01 the world community's relief efforts. There has proved to be an urgent need for improved coordination and cooperation between organisations of the United Nations system, other humanitarian agencies and Member States. The situation in Iraq proved this point with alarming clarity.\nBut improved coordination will not be possible without structural reform and new institutional procedures. We therefore strongly support the creation of a new high-level post, directly under the Secretary-General, with special responsibilities in the area of coordination. The position should be filled by a person with strong authority and personal standing in order to ensure both the necessary coordination and the maximum political backing for United Nations humanitarian operations in situations with conflicting political views and interests.\nThe United Nations operation in Iraq, set up to provide relief to refugees and internally displaced persons, should be seen as a milestone. The deployment of United Nations guards, aimed at providing security for the United Nations relief workers and property, took place against the background of strong concern about the fate of large groups of people, the fleeing Kurdish population in particular.\nIt has greatly expanded our understanding of the capacity of the United Nations to assume a stronger role in the humanitarian area. From the outset, Denmark has strongly supported the United Nations operation in Iraq, which was initiated, with imagination and courage, by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan. We are at present the largest single contributor of personnel to the United Nations guards. In all too many cases political motives have prevented humanitarian assistance from being received by a country or from reaching population groups who are badly in need of help. Without a fundamental change in our attitude towards such obstacles we shall never be truly successful. It is my strong hope that, inspired by the United Nations operation in Iraq, we shall soon see further progress in recognition of the right of the United Nations to intervene for humanitarian purposes.\nRefugee flows, caused by turbulent changes around the world, constitute a large and growing problem. It is becoming more and more obvious that two of the so-called traditional solutions - local integration in neighbouring countries, and resettlement outside the region of origin - are coming increasingly under strain. However, these traditional solutions are still important when such flows occur, and I should like to acknowledge the efforts of many countries - not least the poorest - in shouldering such responsibilities.\nAlthough there are some recent successful examples of the third traditional solution - that of voluntary repatriation - the time has come to take a much closer look at the causes of refugee movements. It is a paradox that those countries, or regimes, whose actions are the root causes of refugee flows are not called upon to shoulder their proper share of the ensuing burden.\nThe consequences of violations of the most fundamental human rights often give rise to further migration of a more general nature and, therefore, become even more serious. The receiving countries and those who seek to protect refugees find it increasingly difficult to identify and assist the people who are in real need. This may eventually endanger the whole concept of the protection of refugees. If we wish to remove some of the main causes of future refugee flows the time has come to extend the notion of State responsibility to include responsibility to create tolerable conditions for one's own citizens and not to dump one's problems on other countries' doorsteps.\nRespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the purposes of the United Nations. The violation of human rights in any part of the world is a legitimate concern of all States, the United Nations and the world public at large. Such concern, and the ensuing activity, cannot be considered unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of States.\nIt is a paradox of international law that, on one hand, a customary rule may have evolved, permitting a State to intervene outside its own territory through rescue missions vis-\u00e0-vis their own nationals if they are exposed to grave dangers, whereas, on the other hand, it is still not legitimate to use armed intervention to rescue thousands of innocent persons whose lives are in danger because of their own government's repressive policies.\nThe deployment of allied units in northern Iraq, on the basis of Security Council resolution 688 (1991), should become a turning-point as regards the balance between the principle of sovereignty and that of humanitarian intervention. I strongly support the following statement contained in the Secretary General's address in Bordeaux on 24 April this year: \\\"We are clearly witnessing what is probably an irresistible shift in public attitudes towards the belief that the defence of the oppressed in the name of morality should prevail over frontiers and legal documents.\\\" Those were the right words at the right time. I believe that consideration is urgently needed on how the international community should assume its responsibility to take action in the face of massive violations of human rights that endanger the lives of large numbers of innocent people. In situations characterised by such conditions, \\\"internal affairs\\\" must be considered a concept of the past.\nI have dwelt at length on what I think are essential reforms of the United Nations system. Let me cow turn briefly to some of the areas of serious conflict in the world.\nIn Yugoslavia, the escalating violence has given cause for great concern. The European Economic Community will continue its mediating efforts through the peace conference in The Hague and the continued presence of its monitors in Yugoslavia. These efforts must be based on the principle of the people's right to self-determination and on the full protection of the rights of minorities. At this time, the Security Council is debating how the United Nations can best support the efforts of the European Economic Community.\nThe current regime in Baghdad continues to provoke the international community by Ignoring Iraq's obligations under international law. The situation of the Iraqi people - and not least the plight of the Kurds and the Shiites - continues to cause deep concern. The international community must insist that Iraq unambiguously adhere to Security Council resolution 688 (1991), attaching special importance to the call for a genuine dialogue with a view to securing basic rights for the entire Iraqi population. The question of whether to relax the sanctions against Iraq must be closely related to its fulfilment of all its obligations under Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991).\nThe outcome of the Gulf crisis created new opportunities for solving the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question. All parties concerned should seize these opportunities to provide the basis for a just, lasting and comprehensive solution in the Middle East. And the United States-led peace initiative deserves our full support. We are convinced that with the necessary political will and courage, the parties concerned should be able to overcome the final difficulties concerning the modalities for the peace conference. It is my sincere hope that the parties will refrain from taking any step that might result in new obstacles to convening the peace conference and that they will implement confidence-building measures. In this respect, the G-7 proposal to suspend the Arab trade boycott of Israel in return for a freeze by Israel of its settlement policy warrants special attention.\nAn additional confidence-building measure would be the repeal of the resolution equating Zionism with racism, a point of contention which for the past 16 years has strained the atmosphere regarding Middle East questions. Denmark wholeheartedly supports efforts to achieve this repeal. With regard to Cambodia, we are particularly pleased with the decisive progress made in the last few days towards a comprehensive political settlement. We congratulate the five permanent members of the Security Council, the two Co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference - Prance and Indonesia - and the members of the Cambodia Supreme National Council, under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, for the work they have done.\nIf, as we confidently expect, the settlement documents are signed on 31 October, the largest United Nations peace-keeping operation of all time will follow. It will be another major test of the ability of the United Nations to respond to new challenges. In this case it will be the challenge of bringing peace and democracy to a people who have suffered unimaginable tragedy for too long.\nIn South Africa, progress towards a non-racial democracy has continued, in spite of difficulties. The legal foundation of apartheid has been scrapped and preparations made for real negotiations on a new constitution. The early convening of an all-party conference should be the next major step towards democracy.\nWe trust that the United Nations will continue to play a constructive and active role in this historic transformation of South African society. This year the General Assembly has a special responsibility to maintain the unity among Member States in supporting the continuation of progress in South Africa.\nDenmark has for many years given assistance to victims of apartheid. We are willing to adapt the nature of this assistance and contribute directly to the establishment of post-apartheid society.\nPolitical and economic changes have been accompanied by a new commitment to protect our planet from environmental degradation and resource depletion. In deciding to convene the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and development, the United Nations demonstrated its determination to respond to these new challenges. We have the highest aspirations for the Conference.\nThe objectives of the Conference and the related negotiations on climate change and biological diversity are shared by all. We have a strong self-interest in protecting the natural resources that will form the basis of future development. And we all share the desire to break the vicious circle of poverty and environmental degradation.\nThough all countries share a common responsibility, the responsibility is also differentiated. Industrialised countries must make a special effort to clean our own house and to make sure that measures taken in developing countries support, rather than hamper, their development.\nOne necessary condition for realising this aspiration is the full integration of environmental concerns into development strategies. Another is a substantial increase in financial flows to developing countries.\nAt the meeting in Rio de Janeiro next June, we will make every effort to ensure that the Conference produces concrete, operational results with regard to legally binding conventions on climate and biodiversity and also regarding the processes being initiated by the adoption of \\\"Agenda 21\\\" and the \\\"Earth Charter\\\".\nOnly a few years ago, many were disillusioned as to whether the United Nations could play a genuine role in solving conflicts and maintaining peace. This has changed dramatically. The world community's confidence in the peace-keeping and peace-building activities of the Organization has grown significantly, and the number of United Nations operations has increased during the past few years.\nWe have a great responsibility to use this year's General Assembly to consolidate the progress already achieved and to create a strong Organization that can fulfil the aspirations of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, let me convey to the representatives present at this session the warmest congratulations of the people and Government of Guinea, and of His Excellency General Lansana Conte, the President of the Republic. I should also like to say how happy my delegation is to see you elected to the presidency of this forty-sixth session; we would express to you our conviction that, thanks to your great qualities and diplomatic experience, our work will be very successful. To that end, I assure you of the full cooperation of my delegation towards the success of your difficult and important mission. Your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of Malta, deserves our tribute for the serenity, efficiency and ability with which he presided over the work of the forty-fifth session.\nI should also like to convey to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary-General of the Organization, the great appreciation and gratitude of the Government of the Republic of Guinea for his self-sacrificing devotion to international peace and security. I take this opportunity to tell him how greatly my people appreciated the message of peace and friendship he brought to us when he visited Conakry from 6 to 8 June last.\nThe recent admission of seven new Members bears witness to the universality of this Organization and will certainly make our Organization more dynamic as it works towards its purposes. Thus, we should like to welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and the Baltic republics of Lithuania. Estonia and Latvia.\nThis session is opening onto e new era marked by the disappearance of the bipolarisation of the world which for so long had been an obstacle to progress in international relations. Since late in 1989, the world has witnessed many events which made obsolete the old political and legal structures whose fragility made them unable to stand up to the will of the peoples to determine their own futures and impose respect for human rights as the basis of human society.\nThere are many lessons to be drawn from these events, both in terms of social thought and of political practice. While the advent of this new era gives grounds for great hopes in some parts of the world, it also gives rise to some concern in other parts which are being shaken by waves of violence and by massacres, which could well make the peace rather precarious.\nIn this new context, the international community must, first of all, try to eliminate all danger of war, particularly nuclear war. Here, my delegation welcomes and encourages the recent American initiatives in the area of disarmament. Next, the international community must extend the spirit of cooperation into all areas, particularly those of economic relations and the solving of social problems. Lastly, it must work to ensure the primacy of law in international affairs and of respect for human rights and the rights of peoples.\nThe current process of democratisation is perceived everywhere as an obvious sign of a basic change, the result of which will be justice, social stability and greater prosperity. This process, if it is to be effective and take root, must recognize the historical, social and cultural realities of the countries involved. Imposing any kind of blueprint or stereotype will only jeopardize the efforts being made by societies to develop themselves and will hold back the development of the individual.\nIn the Republic of Guinea, our recent adoption of our Basic Law - the Constitution - reduces the gap between the aspirations of the people and reality, and gives every citizen the means to express himself freely and to liberate himself. The gradual disengagement of the State from the industrial and commercial sectors, the encouragement of private initiative, the promotion of individual ownership, and the creation of conditions for social stability, unity and national cohesion are at the heart of the changes now under way in my country.\nHowever, experience has shown that achieving democratic objectives in African countries does not happen quietly and without challenge. Unfortunately, the will for democratisation is coming up against difficulties deriving from the implementation of structural adjustment policies which and this is a point I should emphasize - are not enjoying the support we expected from the donors. That this should be so is worsening the deprivation and the feeling of frustration experienced by our peoples, and so our States are becoming increasingly dependent on international institutions and bilateral partners.\nMy Government is aware of these possible pitfalls, and has therefore been working for a peaceful transition, during which a national transitional council has been set up to prepare organic laws to govern the constitutional institutions which are provided for in our Basic Law and which should operate according to the principle of the separation of powers. The transitional period will end in December 1991. Then, next year, the democratic institutions provided for in the Basic Law will start to live and breathe as political parties start up, the legislative bodies are formed, and the Supreme Court is installed.\nIn Africa, even though Namibia's accession to independence has had a salutary effect on the situation in southern Africa, the dismantling of apartheid is still coming up against difficulties because of the survival of the intrinsic structures of the anachronistic system there and the persistence of political violence. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made by the De Klerk Government, which promises an auspicious atmosphere for the negotiations. The objectives of the Programme of Action adopted at the sixteenth special session of the General Assembly, in December 1989, are valid today.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, my Government welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts and the entry into force of the cease-fire, which will enable the United Nations to give practical effect to its peace plan.\nNow more than ever before, peace in the Middle East and the Palestinian problem are the focus of the international community's attention. Indeed, the Gulf War gave rise to some hope for an overall settlement of the Middle East crisis. The Guineas Government is convinced that action by the international community, supported by the spirit of compromise of all the parties involved, is absolutely essential to the success of the imminent international peace conference. All this notwithstanding, recognition of the rights of all parties is the only path towards a just, comprehensive and lasting solution of this crisis, which has been a source of concern to the international community for so long.\nMy delegation welcomes the positive developments in the settlement of the Cambodian conflict. These developments are at the heart of the national reconciliation reached through the establishment of the Supreme National Council headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Happily, this situation augurs well for an end to a long era of hostilities and suffering for the peoples of that subregion.\nThe recent agreements between the United States of America and the Soviet Union constitute remarkable progress towards general and complete disarmament. But the persistence of some hotbeds of tension and the proliferation of civil wars here and there make any hopes for ultimate peace still hypothetical.\nIn my delegation's view, the establishment of a moral and political climate aimed at the complete elimination of all weapons is still a categorical imperative. Limiting military expenditures and budgets will certainly have an immeasurably positive effect on the economic and social development of many regions of the world.\nA study of the international situation shows that the ideological and military confrontation between East and West no longer constitutes a threat of world or regional tension; but there remain many economic and social imbalances between North and South. In this respect, the economies of the countries of the South remain weakened by the dizzying drop in commodity prices, the burden of debt servicing, meagre support for structural adjustment policies, and the paucity of financial resources. For Africa in particular, external debt remains a problem whose scope and gravity impose certain requirements that the international community will have to face in the short term decisively and globally. My delegation therefore endorses the recommendations of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly, in April 1990, on the re-launching of growth and development in the developing countries. Similarly, my country supports the Secretary-General's initiative on the holding of a conference on the financing of development. We also support the Japanese Government's proposal to host an international conference on African development\nToday more than ever before, questions of the relationship between man and nature arise with increasing urgency. Almost two decades ago, the United Nations sounded the alarm in respect of the threat by human activities to the ecological well-being of our planet. The awareness of a planetary heritage has aroused powerful solidarity among nations with a view to making a concerted effort to ensure that future generations will inherit a healthier planet where man can live in perfect harmony with his ecosystem. My Government therefore supports the holding of the international Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992.\nChanges in all areas of human and social life entail some negative effects, such as drug abuse, narcotics trafficking and crime. The disintegration of basic social structures and the disparities between town and country, which lead to exodus from rural areas, leave the individual almost defenceless against the pressures and temptations of the big city and thus bring about the violent social disruptions that continue to plague some third-world countries.\nIn that respect, my country welcomes the decision by the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session to make 1994 the International Year of the Family as the natural basis for life in society and a factor for the development and support of the individual. Hence, the convening in 1995 of a world conference on women would form part of the strategy to combat social ills. As to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, we in Guinea regard it as the expression of the international community's will to strengthen multilateral cooperation on behalf of children.\nI cannot fail to refer here to the mass exodus caused by the Liberian crisis, a tragic example of the effects of political upheavals within a State and a subregion. The serious economic, political and social problems resulting from that crisis affect all countries of the subregion. In Guinea, the sudden massive influx of almost 500.000 refugees has caused economic, environmental, housing, health and hygiene problems. The crisis, which plunged Liberia into genocide and caused enormous material devastation, can be resolved only if all the political viewpoints involved are represented in a joint national effort to put an end to the people's suffering and wandering. Here I would salute and encourage the efforts made and still being made by the countries of the subregion to deal with that crisis. Lastly, I would make another urgent appeal to the international community on behalf of my Government for medium- and long-term assistance for the Liberian refugees and the peoples that so generously took them in.\nThe great changes that have taken place this year at the political and social levels, which have basically altered the geopolitical shape of our planet, can be attributed to the constructive role played by our world Organisation in the thawing of regional conflicts and in the struggle for a more just, prosperous and democratic world. A new context for international relations is being born, the context of a new civilisation whose values will be freedom, democracy, dialogue, cooperation and peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am happy to congratulate you warmly, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. The Bahamas is confident that, given your vast experience and diplomatic skills, you will lead this session to a successful conclusion.\nI take this opportunity to express deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, for the excellent manner in which he presided over our deliberations at the forty-fifth session.\nOur Secretary-General has given much to our Organization and we owe much of our success in the past year to his wise leadership. The Bahamas wishes to record its appreciation for his untiring efforts as a champion of peace. As he demits this high office, the Bahamas wishes to pay the highest tribute to this great son of our Latin American and Caribbean region for his enormous contribution to this Organization. Among his greatest legacies will be his dedication to fostering the social and economic development of developing countries - a noble legacy indeed.\nI wish also, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Bahamas, to welcome the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, North and South Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands to membership in the United Nations.\nOnly two weeks ago the first democratically elected President of Haiti, the Reverend Father Jean-Bernard Aristide, proudly addressed this Assembly. He, and indeed all of us, held great expectations then that Haiti had finally closed the door on its political past and stood poised in the sunlight of democracy, ready to challenge the international community to live up to its promises and obligations to render real economic support to the fledgling Haitian democratic Government, without which it could not survive.\nToday I am forced to join the world community in condemning the betrayal of Haitian democratic ideals by the military. This latest attempt to wrest power from the duly elected and constitutional Government of Haiti is particularly bitter to those of the region who played so intimate a part, in the realization of Haitian democratic elections less than one year ago and who witnessed the inauguration of President Aristide in February of this year. We call on those who have seized power in Port-au-Prince to recant and immediately restore constitutional order to the Republic, to bring those responsible for the loss of life to justice and to allow Haiti to continue on its path to genuine growth and development. We call for international solidarity in the pursuit of this goal and we urge speedy action to end the suffering of the Haitian people.\nThe decade of the 1990s has already proved to be one of tremendous revolution, as evidenced by dramatic charges in the international political landscape. At no time in history has there been a more widespread quest for freedom and democracy. Consistent demands and pressure to dismantle apartheid have set the wheels of change in motion in South Africa. The proud people of Namibia celebrate the first anniversary of nationhood and the German people a year of reunification as the aspirations of the peoples of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania to independence have been realized.\nWe also welcome the success of the United Nations-sponsored peace initiative in El Salvador and we hope that the parties will observe the letter and the spirit of the agreement so that the people of El Salvador can enjoy the benefits of peaceful development. Although at tremendous cost. International action repelled aggression in the Persian Gulf and upheld the basic tenets of the Charter of the United Nations. Today the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Kuwait are preserved.\nWe welcome the initiatives currently under way to bring all States involved in the question of the Middle East to the negotiating table. We reiterate our support for an international peace conference to address the right of all States to exist within secure and recognised boundaries, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nWe commend the Governments of Belize and the Republic of Guatemala on their negotiations, which have now resulted in the establishment of full diplomatic relations. We welcome this development, fully cognizant of the tremendous potential for enhancing the peace and security of the region.\nThese dramatic developments on the international political front have opened new economic opportunities and challenges for the global economy. It is particularly urgent now that countries with weak economies be granted a fair opportunity to participate in the benefits to be derived from now trade and investment initiatives.\nIt will be recalled that during the last session of the Assembly I announced that the Bahamas had introduced a new investment programme designed to encourage the flow of foreign investment capital. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that new legislation is soon to be completed:\n\\\"An Act to encourage the establishment, conduct and expansion of enterprises and investment in designated areas of the islands of the Bahamas by the granting of certain exemptions and fiscal incentives to persons engaging in such enterprises or investment\\\".\nThis kind of economic initiative is particularly important to the development of the Bahamas and the economic advancement of its people. The Bahamas remains deeply concerned over its lack of access to international resources on a concessionary basis and its exclusion from official development assistance. Therefore the Bahamas welcomes the Enterprise of the Americas Initiative, whose proposals on the management of external debt, investment promotion, trade liberalization and the environment are critical to the development of countries in the region. We would encourage other developed countries to undertake similar initiatives and to make benefits available on as wide a basis as possible, including all countries in the region. The Bahamas hopes that the necessary resources required to render the American Initiative effective are put in place in a timely fashion so that the gains might stimulate new, important economic activity in participatory States.\nThe Bahamas regrets that the last round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) did not achieve global agreement, and we hope that the process will be given a further opportunity so that the trade concerns of all countries, especially the developing countries, can be addressed towards the enhancement of international trade relations.\nThe international drug trade has generated social, economic and political problems of such magnitude that the global community is obliged to continue investing vast efforts and resources in combating it.\nIt is evident that a well coordinated and properly financed plan, supported by the commitment of Governments, is required if international efforts against the drug menace are to be successful. The Bahamas has therefore enthusiastically supported the increased emphasis on galvanising the framework for international cooperation in drug control in recent years, resulting in the establishment of the United Nations narcotic drugs Global Programme of Action. The efficacy of the Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies (HONLEA) system is evident. The international drug control treaty regime is now more complete following the adoption of the 1986 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and significant blueprints for drug control generated the very important Global Programme of Action.\nWe are confident that the international community will build on this new foundation to the fullest extent. The Bahamas can be counted upon to play its role at the international, regional and bilateral levels, and we hope that the success which we have achieved through cooperative efforts will be an example to others. We would be happy to share our experience with other Member States.\nAs an archipelagic State, whose principal industries are tourism and fisheries, we have among our highest priorities the preservation and protection of the environment and the maintenance of a sound ecosystem. We endorse the development of a multilateral approach to the protection of the environment which will recognize the needs and concerns of all countries for sustainable development. We look forward to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development and the adoption of international conventions on biodiversity and climate change. My Government wishes to acknowledge the assistance extended by the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Development Programme and the donor community to enable developing countries to participate in the preparatory process for the Conference. We hope that contributions will continue so as to allow for developing countries to be adequately represented at the Conference itself.\nRegrettably, the most appropriate forum for global action again finds itself severely handicapped by its financial situation. States must resolve to give the United Nations the financial resources it needs.\nWhen my country entered the international family of nations 18 years ago my Government made a commitment to respect the basic principles of international law and the Charter of this Organization. We noted then that we entertained no illusions of grandeur about the potential of small States like the Bahamas to influence world affairs. We remain committed, however, to enhancing the work of the United Nations and its potential greatness and influence. We call on all Member States to do likewise.\nIn 1992 the Bahamas will commemorate the quincentennial anniversary of the encounter of two worlds, which is an inescapable part of our history. By virtue of the first landfall of Columbus in the new world at San Salvador, the Bahamas became the first known part of the new world, a historic fact in which Bahamians take a great deal of pride. The first event of our official calendar took place recently with the arrival of the Japanese reproduction of Columbus's flagship, the \\\"Santa Maria\\\" at San Salvador. This visit, to be followed by a year-long programme of activities, including exchanges in the Bahamas involving countries from every region of the world, will highlight the importance of strength and diversity of the cultures of the world. The Bahamas is particularly pleased that so many States have agreed to participate so that we may place the last 500 years in their proper perspective.\nPeace and security are of the utmost importance to human development and advancement. They are also important to the Improvement of economic stability and the arrest of stagnation and recession.\nThe elusive economic recovery, which has occupied so much time and discussion over the last year and a half, recovery from which benefits would flow to developing countries, seems to defy the prognostications of the sages. An atmosphere of fear, and uncertainty will not promote the economic conditions we all long for and require to allay the problems which beset our countries. We pray for and work towards the promise of favourable times.\nThe great English novelist Charles Dickens, writing in 1859 of a Europe faced with the challenges of industrial and political revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, entered into literary immortality the 1ines:\n\\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times - it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness\\\". (A Tale of Two Cities) To paraphrase Thomas Paine, it was indeed a time that tried men's souls. Tumultuous times are once again upon us, and, as they were 200 years ago, they are again centred in Europe. As then, the tremors of Europe's tumult are felt in the Americas, in Africa and in Asia. But troubled times are always times of great opportunity, as Dickens recognized all those years ago. We must look at these times as seasons of light and springs of hope.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMingling with the other people taking part in this General Assembly debate and looking to their faces makes one almost physically aware of fact that, today, the representatives of the Soviet Union, which is transforming itself into a union of sovereign States, are viewed - and rightly so - as envoys of a new nation. It is a nation on the threshold of an entirely new era in its centuries-old political, philosophical, international, legal and day-to-day history.\nWe have just experienced a purifying storm - the defeat of a criminal coup, and everything that took place in connection with the recent Congress of People's Deputies. Today I extend the words of deep gratitude to all those who associated themselves with our resistance to the coup. Those days in August have convinced us finally of one thing - that the quest for freedom has become the main thrust in our own development and in the development of the entire world community. Only a society that gives full protection to individual freedoms and rights can be prosperous and dynamic.\nThe longing for freedom and democracy has always been present in the minds and hearts of our people. It has survived despite decades of despotism and lawlessness, and the years of perestroika brought it to life with renewed vigour and translated it into concrete deeds. The courage of unarmed people stemming the advance of political monsters who opposed the new thinking proved that the peoples of our country will no longer bow the knee to diktat. In essence, the defeat of a coup aimed at restoring totalitarian rule led to a revolution that changed the face of the nation, sweeping away the last remaining pillars of a bankrupt regime.\nThe failure of the coup was also a world-wide victory for the forces of good. Together, we managed to avert the threat of a return to the cold war. To remove the obstacles to progress towards a new state of interaction and partnership, towards democracy and a new era of peace-making.\n\tThe political developments of the first half of this year created the major prerequisites for this change. There have been breakthroughs in two central areas of disarmament - conventional arms in Europe, and strategic nuclear arms. Armaments are being reduced, although only recently it was held that an arms build-up was precisely what guarantees national security. As President Bush pointed out in his address to the General Assembly yesterday, this proves that relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States, between East and West, are no longer relations between adversaries. Such drastic cuts are possible only between partners who have recognized that they have shared, rather than conflicting, security interests.\n\tA decisive step towards the end of the cold war has been taken in an area that is most resistant to new trends - the economy. The London meeting between the Soviet President and the G-7 leaders and subsequent contacts between the Seven and the leaders of our Union and its republics sec the stags for overcoming the economic division of the world and restoring its integrity, its economic interdependence and its market and financial fabric.\n\tIraq's aggression against Kuwait put the nascent global unity to a serious test. The world community's concerted efforts to resist the aggressor, including the efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council, were truly unprecedented. The consensus that emerged in the United Nations around the central idea that breaches of the peace are inadmissible remained intact even after the crisis in the Gulf was over. Indeed, this consensus led to practical steps to resolve other burning issues, including the formidable challenge of the search for a Middle East settlement, and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Today, there remains hardly a single regional conflict where there is not a glimmer of light, at the end of the tunnel.\nEurope - once the epicentre of two world wars and an arena of confrontation - is becoming n laboratory for new forms of interaction. In fact, the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe already transcends regional frontiers. A new transcontinental community is coming into being - a \\\"belt\\\" of trust, cooperation and security that spans the countries of these parts of the world: the entire northern hemisphere.\nPolitical dialogue is getting under way in Asia and the Pacific, as nations and international associations in that region join in a search for mechanism for the discussion and collective solution of common problems. Latin America as a community of mutually tolerant and democratic nations is becoming a political reality. On the African continent, negotiations are replacing hostilities and, at times, barbaric methods of force.\nThis global change is inextricably linked with perestroika in the Soviet Union. Before the events of August the progress of perestroika inside the country lagged far behind its international impact. Now that that gap has been closed, internal and external activities can proceed at a single and accelerating pace. The steadfastness of the President of the USSR, Mr. Gorbachev, the courage and initiative of Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian President, the vigorous popular movement and the overwhelming solidarity of the rest of the world enabled us not only to defeat the coup but also to dismantle the braking mechanisms that hindered the country's progress towards the rule of law and a civic society.\nTo a certain extent the coup and all the risks involved are precisely what brought about a strong centrifugal trend in our country as, between 22 August and 9 September, eight republics declared themselves independent from the union. That is how they reacted to the threat posed by the putsch, the aim of which was the restoration of a totalitarian society.\nThe extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies at the beginning of September met the challenge of the time, establishing for a period of transition a structure whereby the republics - to use the words of the President of Russia - would obtain as much sovereignty as they could take. Now that the element of coercion is behind us and the sovereign republics are able to take stock of the situation, there has developed a centripetal trend, which is gaining momentum.\nThis is evidenced by the intensive activity of the State Council, chaired by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and comprising the leaders of the Republics. The first decision of this body was the recognition of the independence of the three Baltic States. At the second session of the Council the basic forms of an economic union - which will be open for participation by any Republic, including the Baltic States, should they so desire - were addressed and endorsed.\nThe State Council is working on measures to overcome the rather critical problems - to say the least - of food and medical supplies in the coming winter and spring months. The Inter-Republican Economic Committee has been very active in this regard.\nAll-union government agencies constituted by the Congress continue to function in the four key areas: foreign policy, defence, law enforcement and security. Profound military reforms are taking place, these will lead to a radical cut in military expenditures, which for many years have placed such a heavy burden on the budget of our State.\nThe Extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies, the State Council and the President of the USSR have thus answered the questions that had been causing world-wide concern. It can now be seen that the answers were constructive and sent a positive signal to the world community. As a dynamic, although still fragile, balance emerges between the centre and the Republics, we can see that we are now on the right course - despite the deviations or set-backs that may occur - and we look with renewed expectations to the international community for all the support it can lend us in making a rapid transition and taking a respected place in the family of nations. By stating this publicly I am fulfilling one of my important tasks at this session of the General Assembly,\nThe new Union, at this decisive stage of its formation, needs the support of the world community, but it is precisely the world community that has an interest in the success of our efforts, since the prospects for creating a stable, democratic and civilised world order on our planet. Earth - which may be the only one in the universe - depend on this.\nThe President of the USSR and the leaders of all sovereign States and Soviet Republics are aware of their responsibilities under the Soviet Union's existing international agreements and obligations. I should like to reaffirm that the union of sovereign States will be the direct successor of all such commitments, including those we have assumed as a nuclear Power. Our country's nuclear weapons remain under effective centralised control.\n\\\"New challenges\\\" is a favourite subject of political scientists. Not so long ago this term came to denote such things as international terrorism, international drug and arms trafficking, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), degradation of the environment, and the problems of human psychological adaptation to new parameters of progress. The depth and danger of these new risks have forced the world community - and did so even back in the days of the cold war - to begin formulating adequate responses to these transnational challenges. And although the bulk of the work still lies ahead, negotiating mechanisms are already emerging and international legal instruments are being put into place.\nHowever, let us admit, both to ourselves and to the whole of mankind, that virtually none of us was prepared to face the risks of the new, historic period. Cleansing storms have thundered over the expanses of eastern and central Europe, bringing with them all the promise that freedom holds out, bringing back the sense of dignity, self-esteem and faith in man's lofty mission on Earth. And it is not freedom's fault if the flames of ethnic strife have suddenly engulfed the world like the outbreak of a long-forgotten disease. Age-old and seemingly subdued instincts have come alive - instincts which have no place in the new environment. And all this is accompanied by the threat of economic chaos, flaring social contradictions, refugees and disease.\nEurope, which had seemed the least vulnerable of all the continents, has suddenly shown its susceptibility to the virus of nationalism. After the division of Europe had been overcome without confrontation or instability and Germany had been peacefully and democratically reunited, Yugoslavia faced a crisis and is now on the brink of civil war.\nWhy this un-preparedness for new risks? We were too busy eliminating the deformations of the cold-war era to formulate in good time a positive agenda that would meet national aspirations. Regrettably, the energy released as a result of East-West reconciliation has not only served constructive purposes but also fuelled a resurgence of national egotism. Nationalism is becoming the main breeding ground for terrorism. The mortar attack on Downing Street, the villainous assassination of Rajiv Ghandi, the bloodshed which is still going on in Nagorny Karabakh, and elsewhere, are convincing evidence of that.\nThere is a danger that the ideological division of the world may be replaced by attempts to divide and antagonize countries, peoples and nations on national, ethnic or religious grounds. The result may be the nineteenth century revisited, albeit it with significant new features, such as global interdependence and weapons of mass destruction.\nThe problem is how to make the growing national self-awareness serve the cause of progress, freedom and the prosperity of people; to keep national identity slogans from becoming vehicles of separatist policies leading away from the mainstream of world integration to absurd autarchy in either economic or cultural life.\nWhenever national egotism spills over State borders as was the case with Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, the international community must remain true to its position of principle and take the necessary steps, including enforcement measures, in keeping with the United Nations Charter. Of course, military force - or using it in appropriate measure - should be the last resort. Using it even to maintain international law and order necessarily means a set-back for the new thinking, a reversal of the trend towards establishing a new type of international relations. Today, the international community and the United Nations have sufficient capabilities to curb an aggressor, whoever he may be, and to restore justice without the use of military force - or using it in appropriate measure and on a collective basis.\nThere is also a certain degree of understanding with regard to ethnic conflicts of a purely domestic nature. The golden rule in this respect is to do no harm.\nProblems arise also in the grey zone between internal jurisdiction and international responsibility. Basically, it is a question of the further development of the sovereignty principle in international law, as applied to the new realities and risks and to the need for universal interaction between States.\nConsensus must be achieved on a set of basic rules, criteria and principles for international response by the world community to emergency situations, a kind of code of responsible conduct for States, in an era of an interrelated and integral world. Such a consensus should combine the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of States with the need for States to fulfil their obligations under the United Nations Charter and other international legal instruments, and for the United Nations to pursue its goals in all the spheres prescribed by its Charter.\nThe principal objective hare is to harmonise national, regional and global interests, to assert a single universal scale of democratic values providing for freedom of choice, a variety of forms of social development, economic and political pluralism and the supremacy of international law and human rights.\nThe problem of individual freedom in all its dimensions is becoming central in world politics today. Providing for all basic human rights has become an imperative both of national development and international relations.\nThe gravest challenges arise in the world economy. Imbalances and deformations are the inevitable companions of economic progress. On the one hand, the end of the cold war has put an end to bloc rivalry in dealing with the third world. Against the background of interdependence, development ceases to be a one-dimensional notion and assumes a universal character. This is the key to a balanced world economy and to providing a solid basis for resolving global issues. On the other hand, there are growing fears that the new East-West relationship will leave many developing nations on the periphery of the world economy. At the same time, the third world is becoming increasingly polarized. Economic success in a number of countries is accompanied by worsening crises, poverty and hunger in the poorest nations. To prevent accumulated contradictions from exploding is a priority task. Moving away from ideologically motivated assistance should not mean forgetting those who simply cannot survive without outside help.\nThe same applies to the factors which hamper progress towards environmental security. Chernobyl became a world-wide disaster. Yet, it is also a symbol of international solidarity in a struggle for survival and the triumph of humanism in relations between States. The United Nations Chernobyl Pledging Conference, which was held here recently, demonstrated this once again.\nOne of the lessons to be learned from Chernobyl and other environmental catastrophes is that there can be no effective way of avoiding disaster without overcoming the inertia of old industrial practices. The objective is to readjust the whole structure of the world economy to make it environmentally safe. This can only be achieved through concerted efforts.\nNew international relations should be universal. Within generally recognised norms of civilised behaviour, a11 nations, regardless of their ideological or political preferences and dislikes, should maintain normal and proper relations. Lingering hostility, let alone the lack of elementary dialogue between a number of States, objectively generates tension within the very fabric of international relations.\nThe USSR is paying its last diplomatic debts inherited from the cold war. We have normalised our relations with the Republic of Korea and launched a comprehensive process of restoring normal relations with Israel.\nThe new world realities of today require institutionalised security and cooperation structures, the modernization of existing mechanisms and the creation of new ones where necessary. At the same time, we should not hesitate to abandon certain previously established structures which are inherently incapable of evolution. The Co-ordinating Committee for East-West Trade Policy (COCOM) is at the top of that list.\nThe activities of newly established as well as restructured international organizations should be integrated in order to add stability to the pillars of comprehensive security.\nThe general outlines of this process were defined by the international community in a resolution adopted at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly on enhancing international peace, security and International cooperation in all its aspects in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. It was at that time - two years ago - that conceptual agreement was reached to begin drafting the fundamental principles of civilised international communication at the current stage of history - sometimes referred to as the new world order.\nMembers may recall that that resolution was the joint initiative of the USSR and the United States. When I met President Bush today, we reiterated the commitment of our two countries to broader cooperation in strengthening the United Nations as well as in all other areas. This commitment rests on a new foundation in the Soviet-United States relationship - no longer one of confrontation or even rivalry, but cooperation and friendship for the good of the world community as a whole.\nThe philosophy of new international solidarity, which is finding its way into practice, signifies a de-ideologization of the United Nations. In renewing our Organisation we should once and for all leave behind us the legacy of the ice age - like the obnoxious resolution equating Zionism with racism.\nA transition to partnership and collective action bears the promise of United Nations universality, both in terms of its membership and in terms of its areas of activity. The process has already been set in motion. At this session of the General Assembly new Members have joined the ranks of the Organization. These include States of differing size and population. Our support for their admission to the United Nations mirrors the overall Soviet foreign policy of developing relations with all States, including small and medium-sized States.\nIt is with a special feeling that I wish to congratulate our colleagues, the plenipotentiary representatives of new sovereign and independent States - the Latvian Republic, the Lithuanian Republic and the Estonian Republic.\nI see special symbolism in the fact that one of the first foreign policy steps of the country which began its new political calendar recently was to recognize the full independence of the Baltic Republics and provide immediate support for their joining the United Nations end associating themselves with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process. That took place in Moscow at the beginning of the Conference on the Human Dimension. At the present time the process of establishing diplomatic relations and exchanging embassies between the USSR and the Baltic States has started. We are going to hold large-scale talks on vital issues affecting the destinies of millions of people.\nAdapting the entire United Nations system to the new realities of international life is an item on our agenda. Progress has already been achieved in such adaptation and great credit for this goes to the Secretary-General. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is a confident leader of the Organization at this juncture which is perhaps most decisive. We hope that the line he so strongly supports will be duly continued.\nThere is a wealth of promising ideas on this subject. It would appear to make sense to agree upon launching practical exploration of approaches to reforming the United Nations. We are open to any fruitful ideas; we are also working on our own proposals. A concerted and essentially collective regulation of international relations in the areas of security and disarmament crucial for the destiny of the world has become a priority in the activities of the United Nations end the world community.\nSupremacy of law is the main point of reference on the way to shaping a new model of international security. A system of political and legal deterrence should be its cornerstone - a system based not on mutual deterrence but rather on confidence that mutual threat does not exist and also on a high level of trust and openness in the military and other spheres. To achieve thin, it is important to establish, with active United Nations involvement, an atmosphere of general aversion to aggression throughout the world community. Any act of aggression must, from the very start, be regarded as doomed, not only militarily but also politically, economically and morally. An international boycott is the first step to deter and warn the aggressor.\nNext in line is a joint elaboration and implementation of the concept of the next stage of disarmament to absorb the experience gained and make the disarmament processes stable, comprehensive and universal.\nPriority tasks include making military potentials exclusively defence-oriented and working out the guidelines States could follow while restructuring their armed forces in conformity with the doctrine of reasonable sufficiency. That now is taking place in the Soviet Union.\nThe General Assembly could recommend initiating, as an intermediate stage, consultations to work on specific quantitative and qualitative parameters for minimum nuclear deterrence in all its aspects. It is becoming an urgent task to conduct negotiations on the total elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in as short as time as possible. \nA reduction in the number of nuclear tests, with a view to phasing them out altogether as soon as possible, is one means of halting the nuclear arms race. A broad movement in support of this idea has materialized in the political and scientific communities and among the public in various countries of the world. The time has come to establish a United Nations register of conventional arms sales and supplies and to identify jointly its technical parameters with a view to arriving at agreed principles of restraint in arms sales.\nThe development of a long-term concept of the use of United Nations forces in accordance with the Charter of the Organization, including the refinement of rapid response mechanisms for countering threats to international peace, legally codified procedures for deterring a potential aggressor and optimal strategies for defusing conflicts, would facilitate more comprehensive utilization of United Nations capacities. Major tasks in this area include efforts to make United Nations peace-keeping operations more effective and institutionalized, broader use of the preventive capacities of the United Nations and efforts to find ways to correlate global and regional security structures. There is proof that conflicts can indeed be settled through national reconciliation, a balance of interests and responsibility among all the parties involved and the expression of the will of the people in democratic free elections. I am particularly pleased to note the important role that is to be played by the United Nations in implementing the settlement in Cambodia as a truly unique instrument for maintaining international peace.\nToday a unique chance is at hand to set in motion the process of a Middle East settlement. It is essential to lock in the significant pi ogress that has been made in solving the Afghan problem. This session must take action to support efforts in these areas.\nThe ultimate beneficiary of the movement towards stable peace with maximum guarantees is the human being. The domestic policies of States and the practice of international communication should rest on uniform rules applied across the entire range of human rights as an inseparable set of equal categories of a political, civil, social, economic and cultural nature defining the status of the individual and his relations with the State and society. Substantive discussion of specific human rights issues and matters of compliance with international commitments in this area can no longer be dismissed under the artificial pretext of interference in internal affairs. By signing appropriate international instruments, every State, as it were, delegates a fraction of its sovereignty to the international community. The criterion is the primacy of human rights over the rights of nations and other bodies.\nAt the Moscow meeting of the CSCE conference on the human dimension, we focused on the problem of strengthening not only the national, but also the international basis of guarantees for democracy, political pluralism, the supremacy of law and human rights.\nWe might provide for far-reaching collective procedures that would ultimately include binding and mandatory elements. Non-governmental and human rights organisations should be actively encouraged to participate in their verification. In other words, after the Moscow conference, the concept of confidence-building measures, which has been put to work so successfully in the political and military fields since the conferences held in Madrid and Stockholm should, we firmly believe, become the cornerstone and driving force of the new turn to human rights within the all-European and the global context.\n\tMuch has been done in the United Nations, but there are still greater tasks ahead, reflecting the risks and challenges that face the international community today. Our common and inseparable destinies largely, if not decisively, depend on whether the United Nations will be able to succeed in renovating itself and become a true multilateral guarantor of peace and security.\nToday all of us, politicians and diplomats alike, constantly find ourselves with the word \\\"space\\\" on our tongues. We speak of a single economic, legal and ecological space. This has become an extremely up-to-date and fashionable expression. Yet, half a century ago, in the heyday of Stalin's tyranny, the great Russian poet, Boris Pasternak, used it to describe an artist's calling!\n\\\"We have to live without vainglory Live in such a way that after all A love that space bestows upon us Would let us hear the future's call.\\\"\nThe call of the future! The author of Doctor Zhivago and the winner of the Nobel Prize heeded this call. Let us also heed it.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish first of all, on behalf of my delegation and speaking personally, to convey to Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Our joy is matched by our great pride at seeing him presiding over this important session, which is taking place at a time when both the cold war and the Gulf War have ended. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Djibouti not only are Arab nations with friendly relations, but also share the same world vision. It. goes without saying that Ambassador Shihabi's vast experience, diplomatic skill and just view of international problems make him a true leader who can guide us through a constructive and productive session. I take this opportunity to convey to his predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, our appreciation for the outstanding statesmanlike qualities he displayed during his tenure.\nAs the term of Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar draws to an end, it gives me great pleasure to pay him a sincere and respectful tribute for having succeeded with such talent in his difficult international mission. His tolerance, his tenacity, his discretion and his modesty deserve our admiration. He has earned our respect and gratitude with his mediation in ending the Iran-Iraq conflict and in calming hotbeds of tension such as Afghanistan, Western Sahara and, most recently. Central America. Despite serious obstacles, he has always worked to find lasting solutions to numerous thorny conflicts while seeking at the same time to make the international community aware of omissions and inadequacies in development programmes.\nWe are happy also to welcome the admission of new Members to the great United Rations family. The historic changes on the international political scene no doubt made a large contribution to the admission of those countries. Our warmest congratulations go to the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nLast year at this time Iraq's rash and destructive adventure, the invasion of Kuwait, was in the forefront of international politics. A sovereign State had been the victim of the unbridled ambition of a more powerful neighbour. The Iraqi invasion flouted the fundamental principle of non-aggression. The sad consequences of that aggression are felt in Kuwait no less than in Iraq: there has been major material destruction and enormous loss of life, and millions have become refugees. This remains a destabilizing element in that region.\nWe warmly and sincerely congratulate the Emir and the Government of Kuwait, whose legitimacy and sovereignty have been restored.\nWith the disastrous experience of the Gulf War, it has become increasingly urgent that we redefine the role of the United Nations in the search for solutions to conflicts. To formulate a more just system of international security to maintain international peace and stability, the United Nations must give serious thought to a regional system of collective security, to conciliation and mediation and to ways of ensuring that the system survives. To that end, there must be multilateral diplomacy to settle the old economic and political problems. If necessary, the Organization must take preventive diplomatic action. To attain its lofty purposes, the United Nations must reflect on the concept and implementation of a global peace process in line with the Charter purposes: \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" and \\\"to maintain international peace and security\\\".\nDuring the last four decades the world has been subjected to super-Power rivalry in a fierce cold war. The collapse of communism and the end of its totalitarian ideology offer new opportunities to reduce tensions and promote democracy, human rights and individual freedoms.\nWe are genuinely pleased to see the beginnings of an era of mutual trust among States. The arms-reduction Treaty signed in July by the two super-Powers and the proposals recently announced by United States President Bush, and the Soviet response to those proposals, are leading towards reductions in weapons of mass destruction, thus making a meaningful contribution to the cause of international peace and security. But we must follow carefully events in the Soviet Union. Recognition of the sovereignty of the Baltic States and declarations of independence by other States presage the disintegration of the old Soviet empire.\nThe Horn of Africa is a region that suffers from chronic drought and famine- Today it is ravaged by ethnic and civil conflicts. In that part of the continent 10 million people each day are hungry.\nRecent events in Ethiopia and in Somalia have created tens of thousands of new refugees in the region. The Republic of Djibouti alone provides refuge to 85.000, which is an enormous number given the size of our population. Despite its limited resources, Djibouti is doing its best to help those refugees, but they are more and more becoming a burden for a country whose socio-economic structures are already sorely tried. While keeping our borders open to populations at risk, we are still trying to find lasting political solutions to the problems of our neighbours. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General, who has made several urgent appeals to the international community to help those countries that are afflicted by the double scourge of constant drought and civil war.\nTo put an end to all of this suffering - at least the suffering caused by man - it is essential to demonstrate political will. An authoritarian and bloodthirsty regime which encouraged tribal rivalry plunged Somalia into chaos and called into question its very existence. As The Economist stated recently on the subject of Somalia, \\\"the Government, if we take Government to mean a stable bureaucracy and a state of law, no longer exists\\\". The tribal division inherited from the Siad Barre government, economic collapse, anarchy and the spectre of famine, are haunting Somali society today. To all of these tragic elements can be added the fact that the northern part of Somalia is threatening to secede, thus jeopardizing the country's unity.\nFaithful to our policy of conciliation and respect for human life, our President, El Badj Gouled Hassan Aptidon, appealed to all the movements and factions involved in the war to come and meet in Djibouti. After a preparatory conference, six of those movements participated in a second conference held in Djibouti from 15 to 22 July. Observers from 30 countries and international organizations took part in the conference. The peace agreement signed at Djibouti is at present the only viable framework for the restoration of peace, national reconciliation and the establishment of a democratic process.\nThe collapse of the old totalitarian regime should give all Somalia - whether from the north or the south - an opportunity to rebuild the country on new bases, thus responding to the true aspirations of the Somali people.\nAs to the form the future State of Somalia should take, it is up to the Somalia to find the political and institutional framework that suits them best - unity or a friendly separation. Caution must be exercised since the decision could have serious consequences. We voice the hope that the feeling of belonging to the same community will emerge strengthened from this trial.\nWe wish to see peace established, not only for humanitarian and fraternal reasons, but also because of the objective realities. The stability and economic development of Djibouti are very closely linked to stability and peace in the region.\nThe tragic situation in Somalia leads us to believe that international action, similar to that undertaken by the Security Council to put an end to the fighting in Yugoslavia, would be desirable so that the nation of Somalia does not disappear completely.\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that a transitional government of national union has now been formed in Somalia. The new prime minister expects to address the General Assembly at this session.\nHe must also mention the sacrifices made by the people of Djibouti for the brotherly people of Somalia during the regime of Siad Barre and also since the fall of that regime.\nThe peace process in the Middle East, which was blocked for a long time because of Israeli intransigence, seems to be taking off again thanks to the far-reaching changes in the international political situation and the tireless efforts of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, who has been remarkably persevering in the face of Israeli obstinacy.\nAfter the cease-fire in the Gulf War, President Bush promised to create new opportunities for peace and stability it the Middle East. On 6 March 1991, he told Congress that his commitment to peace in the Middle East would not stop at liberating Kuwait. President Bush confirmed his attachment to global peace based on the principle of \\\"land for peace\\\", a guarantee of the security of Israel and a guarantee of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\nAll of these hopes simply collapsed because of the demands made by Israel, which wishes to establish and control the schedule or timetable for any talks. It also wants to impose arbitrary and restrictive conditions in order to prevent any legitimate representation of the Palestinian people in general, and of the population of East Jerusalem in particular.\nIsrael must accept the principle of land for peace. It must recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to create their own State.\nThe international community must shoulder its responsibilities and deal with the settlement policy in the occupied Arab territories.\nNot so long ago, we were all asking if De Klerk would be the instrument for change that South Africa needed, and today we are witnessing irreversible changes, in particular, the complete dismantling of the apartheid system. We pay a tribute to the courage of two outstanding individuals. Nelson Mandela and Frederik de Klerk, without whom this would not have been possible. However, although significant, the initiatives of De Klerk do not quite measure up to the hopes of the black majority. The draft constitution proposed by the National Party on 4 September 1991 contains many positive elements although some of the provisions seem intended to prevent the black majority from actually exercising power.\nUnder the De Klerk proposal, 30 million black Africans would have the right to vote, but a white minority would have a right of veto on major political decisions. The creation of a collective presidency and council of ministers seems designed simply to prevent the rules of the majority from operating and, apparently, seeks to preserve the privileges of the white minority.\nWe believe that the proposal can serve as a basis for negotiations which will lead to the establishment of a democratic and non-racial State; and the peace plan approved by the two main black movements will, we trust, put an end to the violence between rival factions and establish some kind of trust.\nMay I add bow enthusiastic I am about the peace process initiated by the United Nations with a view to a political settlement of the conflicts in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Western Sahara. The search for lasting solutions will, of course, meet with many obstacles, but we are confident and encouraged by the good will that has been shown by the various parties with a view to achieving genuine reconciliation.\nAfrica is suffering from stagnation and unending poverty. Most countries lack the institutions and the resources necessary to have any significant impact on efforts to reduce poverty. As one African stated: \\\"Everywhere in Africa you simply see death and devastation.\\\" All of the economic indicators - growth, world trade, direct investment and industrial development - are falling while debt and the population are continuing to increase. He must not forget the human suffering that is not shown in these figures. This suffering is aggravated by general instability and the civil wars which are raging in various parts of Africa. Our continent needs\tsignificant external aid to try to reduce poverty, wretchedness and famine. We are aware of the need for structural reform so that we move to a market economy and we are also in favour of the political reforms that are needed. We want to have governments that are responsible to their peoples and able to meet their wishes. \nWith the emergence of a positive international climate, Africa's claims must be considered. Africa is seeking its place here in the United Nations. It has tirelessly served the cause of peace and has sought to promote the ideals of the United Nations with devotion, and yet there has never been an African Secretary-General of the United Nations since it was founded. Now a new world order is being established on the basis of greater justice and equality, and we would express the hope that an African candidate may become Secretary-General.\nAnother issue of concern to my delegation is the environment. The developing countries are even more likely to see their environment deteriorate because they are threatened by the double challenge of poverty and population pressures. Lasting economic growth cannot be conceived of if the environment is not protected, for the developing countries are dependent on their natural resources, such as the earth, the water and the forests. Those countries therefore need significant outside financing in order effectively to protect the environment. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, will make it possible for us to reach international agreements enabling us to protect our common future.\nBefore concluding, I should like to reaffirm the devotion of the Republic of Djibouti to the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We have a vital interest in peace and in respect for human rights. These principles also underlie my country's foreign policy, based on wisdom and pragmatism.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure, Sir, to extend to you my congratulations and those of the Indonesian delegation on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. He are gratified that the stewardship of this session has been entrusted to a seasoned diplomat and an eminent representative of a fraternal Asian country with which Indonesia has always enjoyed traditionally close and friendly relations. Your elevation to your high office is both apt recognition of your personal qualities and a reflection of the enhanced role and stature of Saudi Arabia in world affairs.\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco, I should like to convey our deep appreciation and respect for the excellent manner in which he directed our work during a very eventful year. It is with a sense of genuine satisfaction that Indonesia welcomes the accession of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to full membership in the United Nations. We believe that this decision will contribute to bringing their shared aspiration to unification closer to realisation. Let me also add my sincere felicitations to our near neighbours in the Pacific, the Republic of the Marshall Island and the Federated States of Micronesia. Indonesia looks forward to fostering close and mutually beneficial relations with them. We are equally pleased to welcome Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in our midst and to congratulate them on having deservedly regained their rightful place in the ranks of sovereign nations.\nWe are at a unique juncture in history, a moment of both opportunity and challenge as never before presented to us since the end of the Second World War.\nThe momentous transformation of East-West relations has brought an end to the cold war, thus releasing human and material resources which for so long were tied down in ideological rivalry, bloc politics and confrontation. The fundamental changes and powerful new trends currently permeating the global scene have given rise to revived hopes for a new era in international relations, greater peace and more equitably spread prosperity in the world.\nThe past year has seen the further consolidation of major-Power rapprochement and cooperation, including efforts towards the resolution and defusing of regional conflicts and tensions. A renewed confidence in the efficacy of multilateralism in addressing global problems has resulted in a welcome re-vindication of the value and role of the United Nations. On the erstwhile dangerously divided continent of Europe, the processes of coalescence and integration have gained further momentum. Concurrently, deepening interdependence and globalization in the world economy are\npropelling the need for more rational, equitable and mutually beneficial cooperation between nations.\nYet it is obvious that transformed East-West relations alone have not removed, and cannot be expected to remove, all incidences and causes of conflict is the world. The recent Gulf crisis and the complexities in dealing with its aftermath are a poignant reminder of the fragility of the present international security situation.\nThe bright prospects and opportunities implicit in the improved global political climate continue to be sharply contrasted with the emergence of new, and the persistence of old, problems, unprecedented challenges, pervasive uncertainties and unresolved inequities. Simmering tensions and violent conflicts, ethnic strife and religious contention still plague many regions and countries of the world. The last vestiges of colonialism and institutionalised racism have yet to be erased from the fabric of inter-State and inter-personal relations. The trend towards integration among States is simultaneously accompanied by deeply disturbing phenomena of disintegration of States and of societies, in Europe as well as in various parts of the developing world.\nThe positive transformations in the political domain have yet to find their corresponding reflection in the economic sphere, where unrelieved disparities and unacceptable injustices continue to aggravate North-South relations. Thus it would appear that the world is still uneasily suspended between old concepts and new realities and the perceived battle-line still drawn between the threatened privilege of the rich and the threatened survival of the poor.\nThe dawning of a new era in international relations has led to renewed hopes of constructing a new system of global governance and a new world order\nof stable peace, common security and sustainable development. But if the pursuit of this objective is to achieve legitimacy and acceptance by the International community as a whole, then it cannot but be based on the recognition of the United Nations as its centrepiece. Such a new international order must be firmly rooted in the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and organised on the precepts of universality and sovereign equality, encompassing all nations - large and small, strong and weak, alike. For it is only through equitably shared responsibility and a joint commitment to global cooperation and solidarity that we can hope to manage the massive changes that are at present transforming international relations. Moreover, lasting peace and stable security cannot be achieved unless the concept of security itself is expanded to embrace such non-military threats as structural underdevelopment and mass poverty, large-scale unemployment and cross-border migration, resource scarcity and severe environmental degradation.\nIn short, if we are to build a viable new world order, then its architecture and management must  be comprehensively conceived and not be  made dependent on the military and economic might of individual countries or groups of countries. It should be a new world order dedicated to peace as well as justice, to security as well as development, to democracy both within and among States, and to the promotion of the fundamental rights of nations as well as of the individual human being.\nThe changing patterns of relationships between the major Powers will inevitably lead us towards a new, global security environment, no longer anchored in the bi-polarism of East-West contention, but much more complex in its mutual interactions and, for some time to come, less predictable in its evolution. The transitional period can therefore be expected to be marked by\ninherent fluidity and instability. In these conditions, the need to redouble efforts in the field of arms limitation and disarmament assumes added importance and urgency.\nWe are encouraged by the substantive progress that has been made since last year. We welcomed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, although we realize that the restraints embodied in it are still confined to but one, albeit vital, region of the world. We likewise welcomed the strategic arms agreement reached last month between the United States and the Soviet Union, mandating a substantial reduction of their nuclear arsenals. China and France have now signified their readiness to adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty, thus removing one of its major shortcomings. The Amendment Conference of the States Parties to the partial test-ban Treaty, held last January, provided a timely boost to efforts to attain the commonly agreed objective of a complete cessation of nuclear testing, and the process is continuing.\nThe enlarged opportunities now presented to us by the changed global environment should therefore be seized, and sustained efforts need to be deployed to accelerate progress on the priority issues on the disarmament agenda. These include: continuing reductions in nuclear weapons to levels of reasonable sufficiency, as an intermediate step towards their ultimate elimination; the achievement of a treaty banning all nuclear tests by all States in all environments; the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction; the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive chemical weapons convention; strengthening the effectiveness of the biological weapons Convention; and curbing the excessive build-up and transfer of conventional armaments, taking into account the legitimate security needs of States and involving both supplier and recipient countries.\nOf equally acute concern in the fact that in step with the rapid advances in science and technology, new, more destructive and sophisticated weapons continue to be added to the arsenals of nations even as their numbers are being reduced. It is for this reason that Indonesia has repeatedly stressed the urgent need to address the qualitative aspects of the global arms race. It has been generally acknowledged that the weapons of the future will be more destabilizing, impart greater vulnerability, increase the possibility of war and further complicate efforts to reverse the arms race. Thus, the centrality of technological innovation is pertinent, not only to the qualitative arms race but to international security as well.\nWhile globally a spirit of conciliation prevails, focal points of tension end conflict regrettably persist, notably on the continents of the developing world. Although the imposition of super-Power contention onto these conflicts has now practically disappeared, and antagonists are showing greater receptivity towards dialogue and negotiation, the pace of progress in resolving these conflicts remains slow and uneven.\nArmed hostilities in Afghanistan continue, despite the encouraging developments that have recently occurred in the search for a negotiated settlement. The joint decision taken by the United States and the Soviet Union to cease arms supplies to the warring parties was welcome and timely but unfortunately did not stop the fighting. My delegation believes that at this juncture the five-point proposal of the Secretary-General could serve as a useful basis for the initiation of an intro-Afghan dialogue, leading towards the establishment of a broad-based government within a sovereign, independent and non-aligned Afghanistan.\nOn the question of Cyprus, a definitive solution remains elusive despite unremitting efforts to arrive at least at a mutually acceptable outline of an overall agreement. We hope that the projected quadripartite, high-level talks between Turkey, Greece and the leaders of the two Cypriot communities will still materialise in the near future and bring us closer to a settlement based on the concept of a bicommunal and bizonal federation.\nIn South Africa, such legislative pillars of apartheid as the Population Registration Act, the Group Areas Act and the Land Act have been finally torn down. Notwithstanding these laudable developments, the fundamental basis of the apartheid system, particularly its undemocratic Constitution, is still in place and the process of negotiation towards its replacement needs to be accelerated. We are also deeply concerned at the unabated inter-factional violence for which the Pretoria regime must be held accountable. Any lifting of sanctions, therefore, should be deferred until the course of fundamental change towards the establishment of a democratic, non-racial South Africa, based on universal suffrage, has become irreversible.\nThe traumatic crisis that has enveloped the Persian Gulf since August of last year has served as a stark reminder of the volatility of the international security situation, despite major-Power detente. Indonesia is deeply saddened by the extent of the devastation, in terms of the loss of life, the immense suffering and material destruction caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and by the multinational war subsequently waged to redress it. We wholeheartedly welcomed the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and of its legitimate government. But now the international community faces the task of addressing the complex ramifications and problems of the post-war period, including the humanitarian aspects. In this task the United Nations has a vital role to play and it must return to centre stage in healing the wounds of war and in restoring stable peace and security on the basis of all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding the entire Middle East region.\nThe explicit rationale for the Gulf war was to preserve international peace and security and to ensure full compliance with Security Council decisions. It is now time for these standards to be equally and consistently applied to the wider, underlying problems of the region which for so much longer have made the Middle East the powder keg of the world.\nWe must now turn our urgent attention to the larger issues that have always been at the core of agonizing conflict and enmity in the region, namely, the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), their sole and legitimate representative, to secure their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence in their own homeland; the withdrawal of Israel from all illegally occupied Palestinian and Arab lands, including Jerusalem and the Syrian Arab Golan; and the wider security aspects and needs of all countries of the region.\nIsrael has now adopted an even more rigid position towards any effort to achieve a peaceful and just resolution of the conflict. In this regard, Indonesia welcomes the current initiative undertaken by the United States to start a restricted peace conference on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace, and we note the constructive response by the Arab countries directly concerned. However, we do have serious misgivings regarding some aspects of the proposed negotiating format, in particular Israel's arrogation of the right to determine the nature and composition of Palestinian representation. We continue to believe that ultimately the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, as called for by resolution 38/58 (C), remains the most viable negotiating framework within which all the essential elements for a just settlement could be comprehensively addressed. And to be comprehensive, such a solution should necessarily include the restoration of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan and the complete withdrawal of all Israeli occupation forces from southern Lebanon.\nFor the past two decades, Cambodia has been the scene of unending conflict and unspeakable human suffering and a source of continuing tension, turmoil and division in South-East Asia. I am deeply gratified to observe that the unremitting efforts to bring an end to the Cambodian tragedy have now reached the final stages.\nSince September last year, the pace of the peace process has picked up dramatically, resulting in a number of decisive breakthroughs. As may be recalled, the framework document on a comprehensive political settlement, agreed upon by the five permanent members of the Security Council in August last year, was subsequently accepted in its entirety by the Cambodian parties and endorsed by the international community as a whole. With the support and active contributions of the five permanent members of the Security Council, the representative of the Secretary-General and the Co-Chairmen of the three Working Committees of the Paris Conference on Cambodia, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Laos and Malaysia, the two Co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference on Cambodia then succeeded in elaborating this framework into a set of full-fledged draft agreements for a comprehensive political settlement. Through intensive negotiations, and at a series of meetings in Jakarta, Paris, Pattaya, Beijin, and lastly here in New York, the major contentious points in these draft agreements have now been resolved. Thus the way is open for their eventual adoption and signature at the reconvened Paris Conference.\nCrucial in this process was the progress achieved within the framework of the meetings of the Supreme National Council (SNC) itself, under the astute chairmanship of His Royal Highness Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, which, above all, signified the affective functioning of the SNC and the start of the long-awaited process of national reconciliation.\nAlthough soma delicate work in tying up loose ends still remains to be done, it can perhaps be said that at last we can see the light at the end of the tunnel - and this time it is not the light of an onrushing train! Indeed, the presence of Prince Sihanouk and the other members of the Cambodian SNC delegation at this session of the General Assembly is symbolic of this gratifying state of affairs, and we all share the sense of optimism he expressed in his statement before the Assembly yesterday.\nMuch of the credit should go, first and foremost, to the Cambodian leaders who have demonstrated wisdom and the capacity to put the higher interests of their nation before rancour, recrimination and revenge. But as one who, together with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has been so intimately involved in the long negotiating process, I should also like to pay tribute to France, as the indefatigable Co-Chairman of the Paris Conference, to the five permanent members of the Security Council for their decisive role and commitment, to the ASEAN countries for their constant support and solidarity, to our Secretary-General and his Special Representative for their invaluable contributions and dedicated perseverance, to all participants in the Paris Conference and indeed to all States Members of the United Nations for their unfailing cooperation and faith.\nThe past year also witnessed continuing change and transition in the international economy. But, as noted earlier, some of the positive developments that are taking place in the political sphere ere yet to be reflected in the economic domain.\nExpectations that with the amelioration of East-West relations a substantial peace dividend could be reaped, to the particular benefit of the developing countries, have yet to materialize. Earlier hopes that at long last world developments were going to open up vast new opportunities for more-generalised economic progress were subsequently dashed by the outbreak of the Gulf crisis and its aftermath, with all its financial and economic implications.\nThe Uruguay Round, at its supposedly final meeting in Brussels in December of last year, utterly failed to arrive at a successful conclusion, thus portending increased protectionism and the continuation of severe imbalances and constraints in relations between the industrialised and the developing countries.\nIncreasing globalisation and the rapid advances in science and technology that are drastically altering the patterns of world production and economic and financial interchange indeed offer greater possibilities for common progress. Yet, at the same time they may well have a negative impact on the position of developing countries in terms of comparative advantage, in terms of trade and in terms of the international division of labour.\nIt is now also being recognized that the dramatic transformations in the Central and Eastern European economies and the formation of powerful economic groupings among developed countries could have both positive and negative effects on the growth prospects of developing countries. Thus, the elements of uncertainty and unpredictability in world economic developments tend to become even more pronounced. These adverse developments, coming on top of the crippling legacy of the decade of the 1980s from which most developing countries have yet to recover, have Inevitably compounded the difficulties and dilemmas confronting the developing countries, Of especially grave concern in this context is the continuing critical situation in Africa, where the economic and social deprivations of millions cry out for concerted action.\nIn the light of these realities, the need to forge a new global consensus and commitment to strengthen international cooperation, and especially to revitalise the economic growth and development of the developing countries, assumes poignant urgency. The sustained economic progress of the North is not possible without the economic growth of the South, for the fate and fortunes of both are now inextricably intertwined.\nDurable peace cannot be built solely or primarily on the strength of weapons, but should be rooted in the solid bedrock of economic progress and social justice, both among and within nations. Neither can it be constructed on the shifting sands of uncertainty.\nIt is also obvious that the need to reactivate the North-South dialogue has now become more pressing than ever. But if we have learned from the frustrating experiences and the causes of prolonged stalemate in the past, such a reactivated dialogue should not any longer be cast in terms of \\\"demands\\\" on the part of the developing countries or mis-perceived as \\\"charity\\\" on the part of the advanced countries. Rather, it should be based on the imperatives of genuine interdependence, mutuality of interest and mutual benefit. Indonesia remains convinced that, despite the wide diversity in levels of economic development, needs and concerns, both the North and the South share a real and quantifiable interest in seeking open and equitable trading and monetary systems; In achieving stable primary-commodity markets at prices remunerative to producers and fair to consumers) in obtaining a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt crisis based on a development oriented approach; and in ensuring sustainable development through effective international cooperation in environmental protection.\nThe threat of irreversible environmental destruction and the resulting impact on mankind's well-being and on development have become a major global concern. Indonesia, which has always been fully supportive of the pressing need for environmental protection, believes that in this undertaking a balanced approach should be maintained. As an issue affecting the entire international community, it is imperative that environmental problems be addressed on the basis of equitably shared responsibility of all countries and that the issue not become a new bone of contention between the North and the South. Neither should it be made an added condition for cooperation in development. This calls for an unprecedented level of both national efforts and international cooperation, including the provision of additional financial resources and access to environmentally sound technologies to the developing countries.\nParadoxically, both affluence and poverty have contributed to environmental degradation. It is now being commonly acknowledged that past and present patterns of development in the industrialized countries have been a major cause of damage to the environment. On the other hand, for the developing countries, overcoming the problems of poverty and population pressures will be essential if they are to pursue environmentally sound and sustainable development. Indonesia deems it a blessing to be the custodian of vast, rich tropical forests, but at the same time it recognises its special responsibility. Indeed, we are doing our utmost, within our limited material and technological capabilities, to guard against their depletion and to preserve their diverse biological wealth. Ma should note, however, that not only tropical forests but also, for differing reasons, boreal and temperate forests are seriously threatened. Hence, in pursuing sustainable forest management that would allow for both their preservation and their economic utilisation, a global cooperative framework needs to be developed. We trust that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil next year will indeed adopt a comprehensive and balanced approach in addressing the broad spectrum of issues on its agenda, including those on climatic change and on hazardous and toxic wastes.\nThe protection of human rights has of late also become a subject of heightened International attention and concern. But the subject of human rights is, of course, not a new issue. Since 1948, with the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Organization has developed a growing corpus of covenants, conventions and other instruments which constitute an international bill of human rights and, in the process, commonly agreed conceptual perceptions, principles and procedures have emerged.\nAs we all know, two broad categories of human rights can be discerned, namely, civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights. These in turn relate to the rights of the individual and the rights of the community, the society or the nation. The promotion and protection of all these categories of human rights is essential for the full realisation of human dignity and for the attainment of the legitimate aspirations of the individual as well as those of society as a whole.\nHence, human rights are indivisible and interrelated, and precisely because human rights are indivisible exclusive emphasis on one category over another cannot be justified. Assessments of the human rights performance of individual States can be made objectively only if all categories are taken into account.\nMoreover, indivisibility also implies the need for a balanced relationship between the rights of the individual and those of society, or, put differently, the obligations of individuals to their community or society. Such a balance is critical, for its absence can land to a denial of the rights of the society as a whole and, indeed, can lead to instability and anarchy.\nBasic human rights and fundamental freedoms are unquestionably of universal validity. However, it is also commonly agreed that their implementation in the national context should remain the competence and responsibility of each government, while taking into account the complex variety of problems, of diverse value systems and of the different economic, social and cultural realities prevailing in each country. This national competence not only derives from the principle of sovereignty, but is also a logical consequence of the inherent right of nations to their national and cultural identity and to determine their own social and economic systems.\nI fully concur with the view of the Secretary-General, as stated in his annual report that:\n\\\"the principle of non-interference with the essential jurisdiction of States cannot be regarded as a protective barrier behind which human rights could be massively or systematically violated with impunity\\\". (A/ 46/1 p. 10 second paragraph) But, as he also observes in the same report, \\\"maximum caution needs to be exercised lest the defence of human rights becomes a platform for encroaching on the essential domestic jurisdiction of States and eroding their sovereignty. Nothing would be a surer prescription for anarchy than an abuse of this principle\\\". (Ibid., p. 10. penultimate paragraph)\nI therefore believe that in the promotion and protection of human rights the basic aim should be to cooperate in raising a common consciousness in the\nInternational community and to encourage Improvements in the observance and protection of these rights, rather than to accuse, to sermonise or to engage in politically motivated campaigns. Me should not try to remake the world in our own image, but together we can make the world a more humane, peaceful and equitably prosperous place for all.\nIndonesia has consistently endeavoured to adhere to the humanitarian precepts and fundamental human rights and freedoms as embodied in its State philosophy, the Pancasila. its 1945 Constitution, its relevant national laws and regulations, and its age-old culture. Internationally, and as a member of the Commission on Human Rights, Indonesia will continue to work vigorously to ensure that human rights are promoted and protected on the basis of universality, objectivity, indivisibility and non-selectivity.\nDrug abuse and illicit trafficking in narcotics, both symptoms and causes of social degeneration, also remain items of major concern on national and international agendas. A global solution based on multilateral cooperation is now emerging. However, problems of drug abuse and other criminal activity will continue to thrive in an environment of socio-economic neglect and stagnation.\nIn the long term, it is development that offers the hope of successfully addressing social concerns and the opportunity to do so. The idea of convening a world summit for social development therefore merits our serious consideration: it not only would elevate such important issues to the centre of world attention, but would also allow socio-economic questions to be addressed comprehensively.\nEfforts at reforming the United Nations have been going on from the very first years after its inception, but, more recently, in the new post-cold-war climate, there has been a marked resurgence of interest among the international community in making the world body more affective and more democratic in performing its central functions and in fulfilling the original purposes for which it was created. In this connection, many proposals have been put forward by eminent experts on the subject as well as by various non-governmental organisations. Within the United Nations itself, a number of reforms have already been implemented with a view to improving soma of its structures and procedures.\nIt is clear, however, that more needs to be done if we are to make the United Nations the main instrument of global governance in the new era in international relations that is emerging. The improved relations between the major Powers, as manifested in, inter-alia, the new cooperative spirit among the permanent members of the Security Council, present us with a timely opportunity to reconstruct the Charter concept of collective action for peace and security and to fashion it into a workable and effective system of collective security.\nTowards this end, the Security Council should be given a broadened mandate and an enlarged agenda so as to enable it to deal with non-military threats to peace and security as well. In addition, the Security Council, in cooperation with the Secretary-General, should develop a capacity for preventive, or anticipatory, diplomacy. In this respect, the Council could convene periodic meetings at a high political level to survey the world scene, identify potential conflict situations and initiate discussions and measures before such situations reach the point of crisis or armed conflict. There is also a widespread feeling that there should be closer coordination and synchronization of actions between the Council and the General Assembly on issues affecting the fundamental interests of the entire international community.\nA number of proposals have also been made with regard to the functions of the Secretary-General, in particular for a more active role In monitoring and in bringing potentially dangerous situations to the attention of the Security Council within the framework of Article 99 of the Charter. For this purpose, it is widely felt that the Secretary-General should be provided with an improved capacity for gathering timely, accurate and unbiased information.\nAt the same time, the authority and role of the Economic and Social Council should continue to be strengthened so as to enable it to perform the function originally envisaged by the Charter, namely, to provide overall direction and guidance to Member States and the relevant bodies and agencies within the United Nations system within the framework of its task of policy formulation and coordination in the economic and social fields.\nIt is undeniable, however, that all efforts to enhance the role and improve the functioning of the United Nations will come to naught unless underpinned by the commensurate commitment and support, including financial support, of all Member States. The United Nations can only be as effective as its Members will allow it to be and can only succeed if its Members are committed to make it succeed. If Member States continue to use this forum to pursue narrowly conceived interests rather than utilise it as a collective instrument to solve global problems and achieve shared goals and if the nations of the world continue to be torn by conflict and afflicted by mutual mistrust, intolerance and prejudice, then the international bodies they set up can hardly be expected to rise above these shortcomings. Viewed from this perspective, perhaps the more relevant observation to make about the achievements of the United Nations so far is not that it has failed to realize so many of its stated objectives but that, despite inherent limitations, it has nevertheless accomplished so much.\nIt is also in this light that I should like to take this opportunity to express Indonesia's profound appreciation and indebtedness to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the wisdom, dedication and consummate skill with which he has guided the work of the Organization during the past decade. In a world of constant turmoil and conflict, he has steered the Organization towards becoming the central point for conciliation and concordance. In laying the groundwork and in sustaining efforts towards finding peaceful and just solutions to the various conflict situations around the globe, much of the credit should go to the United Nations and to the Secretary-General. Rather than the alarming erosion evident when the Secretary-General first assumed office, we now witness a robust renewal of faith in the role of the United Nations as the unique, multilateral framework for a new, revitalised international order. The reforms he has instituted and the many proposals ha has made on the restructuring of the role and functioning of the United Nations system provide us with a visionary and, at the same time, practicable blueprint for the dynamic adaptation of this world body to the requisites of a rapidly changing world. It is now for us fully to utilize the inherent potential of the Organization in collectively promoting our shared aspirations for a just peace, common security and equitable prosperity for all.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe events that have just occurred in the sister republic of Haiti fill us with a sense of anguish. Democracy in that noble country - a cradle of the ideals of freedom - has been brutally interrupted, just when it was beginning to fulfil its splendid promise after having emerged from the long night of dictatorship and illegality that so long afflicted it. I wish, from this rostrum, to associate my country with the words of condemnation at the overthrow of the democratic Government of President Aristide - an act all the more condemnable in view of the fact that that Government emerged just a few months ago as a result of free, democratic elections supervised by the United Nations. We express our complete solidarity with the democratic and progressive people of Haiti and their freely elected political authorities.\nAllow me, Mr. President, to convey to you, on behalf of the Government and people of Bolivia and on my own behalf, heartfelt congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session.\nThe people and Government of Bolivia also wish, through me, to express their most sincere appreciation of the noble and tireless work of the Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. His historic record will remain indelibly inscribed in the annals of the Organization.\nWe take pleasure in welcoming the Republic of Korea and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea into the United Nations. My delegation, likewise, extends a welcome to the Federated States of Micronesia and to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, whose membership enhances the universal character of the United Nations. Further, we wish to place on record our satisfaction at the admission of the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\nThe principles of peace, freedom, democracy, justice, solidarity, respect for human rights, and economic and social well-being clearly set the stage on which mankind's future must unfold. Nor must we forget that to achieve real and permanent peace we must resolve all conflicts and possible causes of conflict, thus fostering the trust between States that allows a climate of understanding to prevail. This was proclaimed by the Heads of State and Government at the recent Ibero-American summit in Guadalajara, where it was observed that, owing to recent trends in the peaceful settlement of disputes, we could envisage important progress towards resolution of the various regional conflicts that persist on our continent.\nIntimately related to peace, we believe, is the imperative need to solve increasingly urgent economic and social problems that beset the majority of nations represented here, We cannot demand that the principles and tenets of the Charter prevail if the poorest, who constitute the majority of mankind, are not afforded better opportunities, and if their right to a dignified and stable existence is not respected.\nIn that spirit, at the recent Ibero-American summit in Guadalajara, President Paz Zamora of Bolivia proposed that the technology required to satisfy basic needs should become the universal heritage of mankind, within the reach of all. Allow me now, very briefly, to refer to the process of economic adjustment in my country, which has had international repercussions.\nThese years have been a severe trial - years in which the Bolivian people have demonstrated discipline and abnegation in order to fulfil rigorous plans of austerity and collective effort. This process has consolidated the stability of our currency. It has permitted a reduction of the budget deficit by 25 per cent to 3.5 per cent, the amortisation of public debt, the maintenance of confidence by the people, and the growth of the gross domestic product by an estimated 3.5 per cent. Inflation was brought down from 25,000 per cent in 1985 to 17 per cent last year, and it is estimated that the figure will be 15 per cent this year.\nAt the same time, a series of measures adopted as part of the policy of free trade and the encouragement of foreign investment and, above all, the climate of public confidence shown by the return of national capital for new investments or in the form of bank deposits allow us to glimpse a future of brighter hopes and full recovery. It is in that spirit, and with the moral encouragement of a job well begun, that we have achieved a substantial reduction in bilateral debt in the case of several countries, including the United States within the framework of President Bush's Americas initiative.\nWhile introducing a strict programme of macroeconomic adjustment, which made these results possible, my country, consistent with its sense of public duty, has not neglected the social sector. It has introduced, among other measures, the fund for social investment - a novel approach, which has elicited the interest of other countries, and with respect to which we reiterate our willingness to share.\nWe also have the fullest confidence that, as part of this new international current of encouragement for each country's efforts, and with the old patterns of pseudo-paternalism that marred the ideal of cooperation on an equal footing now behind us, we shall see the elimination of the protectionist Measures that industrialised countries tend to apply to free trade, hampering efforts and disappointing the expectations placed In the principles of free trade and their more correct application.\nThe Government of Bolivia wishes on this occasion most especially to underscore the relevant role played by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Latin America and the Caribbean. With regard to my country, UNDP activities take on special importance as they constitute a cornerstone for development plans in various fields.\nA matter of vital importance to my country is the reintegration of Bolivia to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, a permanent and indispensable feature of its foreign policy responding to a deeply rooted national conviction. Its unresolved status is a serious obstacle to the development and integration of this part of the world and runs counter to understanding among democratic regimes. This position of Bolivia has been repeatedly explained in international forums, particularly in the Organization of American States and the United Nations, and has received support and solidarity from numerous peoples and nations.\nWe are by vocation and conviction a peace-loving country. It could not be further from our thoughts even to imagine solutions which are not those of constructive dialogue in order to seek avenues of compromise and mutual interest, in keeping with the peaceful solution which, in conformity with the mandate of the United Nations Charter, is binding upon all of us. Moreover, affirming the need for preventive diplomacy, as has been pointed out by several speakers at this rostrum, would be the very means to identify and diagnose this type of problem.\nThe Government of Bolivia has made known its decision to seek a solution to this problem by means of negotiation and for that purpose has consistently proposed to the Government of Chile that an open and constructive dialogue be \nestablished. How could it be otherwise? We are joyfully witnessing the victory of negotiation, which, with each passing day, is bringing us closer to solving problems which only yesterday appeared insoluble- Consequently, we will continue to insist on the need for dialogue and on the faith that inspires us in the search for a just solution in keeping with American brotherhood.\nThe climate of detente allows us to harbour the hope that dialogue and negotiation will prevail and peace and democracy will be definitively consolidated in the sister Republic of El Salvador. We welcome with satisfaction the result of the process of peacemaking in which we acknowledge the invaluable role played by the Organization and in particular by the Secretary-General.\nI wish to refer to other topics of great importance. The international community is aware that much remains to be done in order to defeat the scourge of drug trafficking. My country has contributed substantially to this struggle. The concept of alternative development, which means replacing the coca economy by a diversified, internationally accepted alternative economy, was presented for the first time in this forum by President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.\nDespite the efforts of Bolivians and help from various countries it is clear that programmes and mandates cannot be fulfilled without greater resources. The principle of collective or shared responsibility between producer and consumer States must be emphasized in this respect. Therefore, we have the obligation to add our voice to the continuing appeal for a prompt and effective increase of financial and technical resources, in order adequately to carry out existing programmes nationally, regionally and worldwide.\nThe question of the environment is receiving particular attention from my Government. This position has been expressed in all international forums and concrete initiatives have been put forward which favour appropriate use of our natural resources and guarantee our peoples' right to development.\nThe continuing search for solutions to the problems of development, together with continuous innovation in increasingly sophisticated technology, have often caused us to lose sight of the need to set in motion mechanisms of interrelationship between the environment and development based essentially on strategies that consolidate sustained economic growth.\nWith the same ecumenical vision that the international community wishes to take in looking to the future and ridding the Earth's inhabitable space of the blight of environmental neglect with which we have lived until now, the President of Bolivia has declared an environmental moratorium of five years beginning in 1990 throughout the country's territory.\nWe are therefore looking forward with great expectations to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, where important and far-reaching agreements on this question will no doubt be arrived at.\nThis is also a good time to recall that, at the Guadalajara summit meeting. President Paz Zamora proposed the creation of an Ibero-American fund for the development of indigenous peoples, with a view to resolving the pressing problems of those original peoples without resort to \\\"Indian reservations\\\", or paternalistic compensation.\nWith the easing of international tensions which, among other harmful effects, led us to a runaway arms race, we should harbour the hope that this Assembly will initiate a genuine process of disarmament in order to benefit the real development priorities of our countries, Bolivia lends its most resolute support to that effort.\nSeveral initiatives have taken shape with a view to revitalizing our Organization. Some have been comprehensive in scope. Others have been more moderate, seeking to give it an orientation which, without affecting the principles or functioning of the Charter, would make its procedures more functional.\nBolivia, as a member of the Rio Group of Consultation, took an active part in the Group's deliberations on the revitalization of the organs of the United Nations system and joined the consensus on the document which was submitted to the Secretary-General. We wish to reiterate our support for the conclusions set out in that document, most especially as regards strengthening the authority of the Secretary-General under the Charter, and as regards the need for appointments of senior officials in the Secretariat to be made so as to reflect the qualities of ability and efficiency of those who apply for them, rather than being the exclusive preserve of particular Members.\nPolitical and economic events that have occurred over a short span of time continue to astonish us and call for serious thought. He are facing a new world in which the old, rigid parameters no longer apply and in which sufficient space must be provided for new realities. The peoples of our countries are telling us, in different ways, what kind of world they hope to live in, and what kind of a future they wish to bequeath to future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly particularly as your brotherly country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and mine, Syria, share ties of common history and kinship.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of what your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, achieved in guiding the work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We wish his friendly country, Malta, progress and prosperity.\nIt gives me great pleasure to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our appreciation of the efforts he has been making for the establishment of peace and security in the world and the promotion of the principles and objectives of the United Nations.\nSyria welcomes the admission of both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to the United Nations. We are confident of their positive contribution in achieving and consolidating international cooperation and security, as well as progress and prosperity for the friendly people of Korea. In view o\u00a3 the Syrian Arab Republic's belief in the right of peoples to self-determination and the right of every people freely to choose their political system, Syria welcomes the admission of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to our international Organization.\n\nThe major international developments which commenced in the mid-1980s have reached their pinnacle in recent months, thus opening a new chapter in contemporary political history. Although it is too early to make categorical judgements on the reasons underlying these developments and their far-reaching effects, it is clear that the main driving force behind them is the ascendance of peoples' desire to regain their freedom and independence and exercise the right to self-determination.\nIn this context, the world has witnessed radical changes in the States of eastern Europe. Germany has restored its unity and the three Baltic States have declared their independence. Change still continues in the Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia.\nIf tensions arise and acts of violence whose motivation are not related to national feelings or the right to the self-determination of peoples occur, they are in reality an expression of frustration and disappointment resulting from the failure to realize the aspirations of the peoples concerned, particularly with regard to their standard of living.\nThe lessons that can be gleaned at a national level from the outcome of these major changes is that freedom and bread are two basic needs for both individuals and society. They are indivisible; neither can be sacrificed for the sake of the other. The balance between bread and freedom constitutes the foundation of the balance between man's material and spiritual needs and the pillar of social peace.\nOn the international level, the most significant lesson is that people's right to self-determination is a driving force that cannot be curbed, that foreign occupation is bound to fail and has to be brought to an end and that the principles of international law and international legality cannot be ignored or dealt with through the adoption of double standards. Only on the basis of these firm principles can world peace be established. Syria, which is an important part of a nation, authentic in its history and civilisation, and which has for decades been facing continuous occupation and aggression, finds in these new international changes a historic opportunity to rectify those situations in our region that have gone awry, to clarify facts that have been distorted, to restore land that has been occupied, rights that have been usurped, and to participate in establishing a just and comprehensive peace in this region.\nIsrael has exploited the years of the cold war, and indeed encouraged it, to obtain the most enormous military and economic assistance in the history of international relations, under the pretext that it is the guardian of Western interests in the face of the Soviet tide and Communist infiltration in the Middle East. The programme of United States aid to Israel alone has exceeded the total value of the Marshall Plan for the whole of Europe. In contrast, the Arabs reaped nothing from the successive waves of the cold war - in which they had no say - but more Israeli occupation of their land and the establishment of Jewish settlements on that land, without any international deterrence.\nThe United Nations resolution equating zionism with racism was adopted as a result of Israeli occupation of Arab territories and Israel's continuing persecution of, and discrimination against, Arabs in all walks of life. The call for repealing the resolution requires, a priori, eliminating the substantive causes which prompted the United Nations to adopt it - that is, terminating the Israeli occupation of Arab lands and enabling the Palestinian people to enjoy their right to self-determination.\nThroughout their long history, the Arabs never indulged in any kind of racial discrimination against any ethnic or religious minority which lived among them. For hundreds of years, Jews lived among Muslim Arabs during which time they never experienced any form of ethnic, racial or religious discrimination or oppression. On the contrary, they lived in grace and dignity to the extent that when the Arabs left Spain in the fifteenth century the Jews chose to leave together with the Arabs because they did not enjoy security or equality outside the Arab environment. The question that persistently poses itself is this: Whereas the Arabs treated the Jews throughout history with such complete tolerance, does the world register how much the Arabs have endured in racial discrimination and oppression during Israel's short history?\nIn spite of all this, the Arabs want peace, along with all nations of the world. What the Arabs want is the implementation of United Nations resolutions, no more and no less. However, the rulers in Israel resist peace efforts with all the power and influence they can muster here and there. Instead of abiding by the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations to which they owe their very existence, they cling to a futile ideology based on expansion and the uprooting of Arabs, and thus sow the seeds of hatred and bloodshed in the region.\nIt is a strange paradox that Israel should demand that the United States finance the building of the new settlements in the occupied Arab territories while at the same time it claims that it wants peace. Peace and the usurpation of the land of other peoples land cannot coexist. There is no doubt that this paradox will become clearer when the American taxpayer in particular discovers the reality of what the Israeli occupation has caused: about half a million Syrians uprooted from the cities of the Golan, people which to date have been unable to return to their homes; and a quarter of a million Palestinian refugees in Syria. Added to this, over 2 million Palestinians who continue to live in the diaspora and are denied the right to return to their homes and properties in which their fathers and forebears lived uninterruptedly for centuries. The question we have to ask is this: Is it fair to continue to ignore the right of return to those uprooted Arabs while large waves of Jewish immigrants continuously push to take their place and settle in a land that neither their fathers nor grandfathers ever lived in at any point in time? Does not this paradox simply reveal that double standards are being adopted? Worse still, does not this paradox encapsulate racist concepts negating the rights of the Arab individual?\nThe major obstacle in the way of the peace process at this point does not simply stem from Israeli preconditions vis-\u00e0-vis Palestinian representation and occupied Arab Al Quds for attending the peace process. Rather, it stems from Israel's narrow vision of the post-cold-war and post-Gulf-war era. Syria believes, together with the Arabs and the international community, that the post-cold-war and the post-Gulf-War era have opened the door to peace and offered an historic opportunity to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East based on international legality, resolutions of the United Hat ions, and the right of peoples to self-determination. As for Israel, it is sparing no effort in closing every door that may lead to peace. It is intensifying the building of settlements. Thus, it exploits the open door to intensive Soviet Jewish emigration, on the one hand, and the deep wound inflicted on the Arab nation by the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, on the other.\nThe official opening of a new settlement in the occupied territories by the head of the Israeli Government last week and his statement that the building of settlements will extend to the far horizon are unequivocal proof of Israel's intentions to sabotage peace efforts.\nWe in Syria, under the leadership of President Hafiz Al-Assad, are determined to engage in the battle for peace until the end. There will be no retreat from our stand, no compromise on our lands and rights. Our demands are legitimate and are supported by international law and by United Nations resolutions. Our cause is just and is supported by both our people and the international community at large.\nLebanon's restoration of its national unity, constitutional institutions and a large degree of its security and normal life is a source of great satisfaction to the international community, in general, and to my country, Syria, in particular.\nUntil recently, many prominent world politicians had believed that Lebanon, which had been engulfed in chaos, strife and bloodshed for the past 16 years, was a hopeless case to the extent that the word \\\"Lebanization\\\" in the political dictionary began to be applied to any intractable situation that faced any large or small country in the world.\nThe cooperation of my country with Lebanon, with which we enjoy bonds of kinship, history and common destiny, was a crucial factor that helped brotherly Lebanon recover from its plight, restore its sovereignty and integrity and resume its role in the Arab and international arenas.\nWhat Lebanon now needs is resolute support by the world community that would, on the one hand, implement Security Council resolution 425 (1973), calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from southern Lebanon and, on the other, contribute to Lebanon's reconstruction and rehabilitation.\nAs for the situation in Afghanistan, we believe that national reconciliation encompassing all Afghan parties would be the most favourable way to reach a solution acceptable to all sides in the conflict. In this context, we welcome the efforts to reach a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in accordance with the latest General Assembly resolution, the proposals of the Secretary-General and the recent joint Soviet-United States declaration.\nWith respect to the question of Cyprus, Syria, which enjoys historic ties of friendship with this neighbouring country, supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and the peace initiatives aimed at convening an international conference to be attended by all parties concerned in order to work out a solution to the Cyprus question, on the basis of United Nations resolutions, which would safeguard the unity of Cyprus, its independence, territorial integrity and the interests of all its citizens.\nWith respect to the situation in South Africa, the achievements made to date still fall short of the objectives to which the people of South Africa aspire. That is why the world community is called upon to continue exerting pressure on the Pretoria regime until all manifestations of apartheid are abolished, and the people of South Africa are enabled to exercise their right to self-determination.\nThe peoples of the world place great hopes in the United Nations, especially after the recent international developments and the end of the cold war. It is the hope of these peoples that the end of the cold war signifies the end of the paralysis that afflicted our international Organization.\nWe, in Syria, believe that the United Nations, with its Charter and principles, is a guarantor of international peace and security and of putting a definitive end to occupation and aggression. We also expect that the new international order to be just must express the aspirations of our peoples and must be established in the context of the United Nations, in accordance with its principles and Charter. We hope for a better tomorrow in which all the peoples of the world will enjoy freedom, justice, prosperity and peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place in a spirit of true peace, tranquillity and security under the auspices of the international community, and the delegation of Equatorial Guinea intends to make its contribution to all Initiatives and suggestions that may emerge for the benefit of free and sovereign peoples.\nI had the privilege of being the first speaker to congratulate Mr. Samir Shihabi on behalf of the African States. This time I should like, on behalf of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea, to congratulate him on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session. His great experience and diplomatic abilities are a sufficient guarantee of the success of our debates. His country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is well known not so much as a great country rich in oil resources but, rather, as a contributor to and faithful collaborator with the international community in respect of the implementation of the principles and ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, and as a country that cooperates in the development of the poorest and least advanced countries, including my own, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Through him, I extend our congratulations to all the members of the Bureau, in the conviction that with their well-known ability they will contribute to solving our problems in the best possible way.\nWe express our warmest congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Justice of Malta, and to the members of his Bureau for their outstanding work during the last session.\nThe previous speakers have expressed their highest regard for our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, a man of patience, determination and a deep sense of responsibility. His self-sacrifice and total dedication to the problems of the international community and the least-advantaged countries merit a high tribute from us, in recognition of the arduous, positive work which, with his great ability, has brought the United Nations to the position that it deserves in the service of mankind.\nThe delegation of Equatorial Guinea shares the sincere general feeling that Secretary-General Pires de Cuellar will remain in the hearts and minds of each of us as an example of someone who has carried out his duty.\nThe admission of seven new Member States to the United Nations is a unique event in the history of our Organisation. My country welcomes this development and congratulates all Members on their unanimous decision, which once again confirms the universality of our Organisation. We are happy to welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, countries with which Equatorial Guinea maintains good, close diplomatic relations. We are proud to have sponsored the respective resolutions on their admission. The simultaneous admission of the two Koreas is a good omen for a sincere, open dialogue that will lead to the peaceful unification of their peoples, as has been done so commendably by Germany.\nWe also welcome and congratulate the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, first on their return to the great family of independent, sovereign nations, and, secondly, on becoming Members of the United Nations.\nWe wish to express equally heartfelt congratulations to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands and to extend a warm welcome to them.\nWe are going through one of the best periods in the history of our Organization, a time when, with the long cold war and ideological bipolarity behind us, we are beginning to enjoy relations in a climate of confidence and optimism. The rapid disappearance of totalitarian Governments and the beginning of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction are the clearest signs of this. They call on us to focus our attention on the point where we should have begun - recognition and re-evaluation of the human person as a free agent and the protagonist of history, concepts which were being devalued, forgotten and weakened by the emergence of incredibly sophisticated machinery of destruction. The international community's new awareness of the qualities of freedom, solidarity, security and development of the human person is above all an encouraging sign of the reconstruction of the world order and an urgent appeal to make a reality of the long-cherished dream of the human community.\nI take this opportunity to express the strong indignation of my country and Government over the military action in Haiti which led to the overthrow of the first constitutionally and democratically elected President, in clear violation of the democratic order and in defiance of the United Nations and the entire international community. We appeal to the military to desist from its action and restore the constitutionally elected Government to power.\nIn my statement in the general debate at the forty-fifth session X said, with special reference to my Government's political programme to institute a multiparty system as an authentic expression of democracy:\n\\\"The fact that Equatorial Guinea still has only one political party is not a contradiction and should not be viewed as unwillingness to allow the popular will to express itself. Rather, it represents a preliminary educational and formative phase for the population to ensure that we do not repeat sorry past experience and that we mature in the process and interplay of democracy.\\\" (A/45/PV.21, p. 86)\nWe are now seeing a unique situation in the political history of Equatorial Guinea. The Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea, created in 1987 as an experimental test of democratic freedoms, with voluntary membership, adopted at an extraordinary session on 31 May this year a resolution recommending that that Government draw up a programme to open the door to a multiparty system. That resolution, confirmed by the first Extraordinary Congress of the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea, held in Bata from 2 to 6 August, has been accepted by the Government of Equatorial Guinea, which, to carry out that mandate, has prepared and adopted a short-term, medium-term and long-term plan. The President of the Republic, its Head of State and Government, submitted the three-part plan to the people on 20 September.\nFirst, the short-term plan proposes the elaboration and promulgation of a set of laws and provisions to provide the legal framework to guarantee other political choices in the country, in an atmosphere of peace, tranquillity and political order, which has reigned in our country since 3 August 1979} revision of the Fundamental Law, as a necessary condition for the promulgation of the other provisions) and the formation and functioning of political parties.\nSecondly, the medium-term plan proposes the creation by the Government of a climate for positive participation by the political parties that have been created in forming the country's elective organs on the expiry of the term of office of the present Legislature.\nThirdly, the long-term plan proposes the creation by the Government of a climate permitting positive participation by political parties at all levels, as provided for by law, for the consolidation of the pluralist system in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\nThe delegation of Equatorial Guinea is proud to inform the Assembly that the Commission appointed to deal with technical aspects of that programme has completed its work and reported to the Government, which in turn is now submitting it to the legislative body, the Chamber of Representatives of the People, for its study and approval,\nThe process of democratisation in Equatorial Guinea is not a haphazard matter, nor is it a result of foreign influence or pressure. Rather, it is born of a deeply felt need arising from the coherent programme of President Obiang Hguema Mbasogo, who, after taking power on 3 August 1979, decided to educate and train the population for a democratic system. Once national unity and reconciliation had been achieved he began the process of democratisation with the entry into force of the Fundamental Law of 1982 and the accompanying change from military government to civil and constitutional government. It is in that context that we must see the Government's efforts to restore peace, order and tranquillity in the country, while safeguarding fundamental freedoms and human rights.\nNot content with recognizing, listing and defining those matters in article 20 and subsequent articles of the fundamental law, the Government also created instruments and control mechanisms for their full implementation. There was thus created the National Commission of Human Rights under Decree-Law No. 7 of 27 September 1990. That Commission has full independence and is absolutely free and impartial; it enjoys immunities and privileges in carrying out its functions.\nIt is from the same perspective that we must also see the coming into force of Law No. 4/1991 of 4 June, regulating the exercise of religious freedom in conformity with article 20, paragraph 5, of the Fundamental Law, which says: \\\"Every person shall enjoy the right of freedom of conscience and religion, individually or collectively, in public or in private\\\". The last pardon granted, on 3 August 1991, which emptied our national jails and closed their doors, confirms the political will to put into practice principles and ideals concerning the well-being of persons.\nOn various occasions we have stressed that democracy, understood as a political system permitting popular participation in public affairs, has no single or absolute model, but is rather a form of government based on and adapting itself to the realities and values of each country.\nHence, we note with sadness and a sense of powerlessness the emphasis with which the problem of human rights is dealt with here, disregarding what, in our view, should be given the highest priority. I refer to the extreme poverty, want, hunger and disease to which virtually more than half the people of the world are victim. If those problems were to be resolved, the human person would be the focus of development. We therefore resolutely support the Secretary-General's idea to convene a world summit on social development.\nPreserving international peace and security and economic cooperation continue to be the common goals the organs of the United Nations should pursue with a view to achieving the best results. He should therefore strike a balance between the organs of the United Nations and greater participation by its Members. This is the way to achieve the democratisation of the United Nations, and thus respect for the will of the majority.\nThe delegation of Equatorial Guinea believes that just as the United Nations tackles social problems, it should also address environment problems, which are vital to our existence. Hence we are encouraged at the holding, in Brazil, of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.\nWe believe that the time has come for the humanization achieved in the political sphere to be extended to the economic sphere. The linking of politics to the economy leads us to doubt that there will ever be genuine and lasting peace in the world. For the poor and least developed countries.\ncancellation of the external debt appears to be the first - and inevitable - solution.\nSince 3 August 1979, the date of the liberation of Equatorial Guinea from a gloomy and painful past, the reconstruction and economic recovery of the country have been among the major struggles waged by the Government. Many initiatives have been taken and many projects carried out. The holding of two Round Tables in Geneva in 1982 and 1988 form part of the process; their recommendations, and the consequent structural adjustments, have been implemented. But for a country seeking to break out of what is barely a subsistence economy, this is truly difficult. I take the opportunity to thank all friendly countries and donors, as well as the international financial institutions, for their valuable support. However, my country is seriously concerned over the continued and persistent functioning of the protectionist system, which has not only made the Uruguay Round unfruitful, but also had negative effects on a country such as ours, which is correctly categorized as among the least developed. We view with optimism the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report on stable solutions to our commodity problems. In this regard, the delegation of Equatorial Guinea welcomes the Japanese initiative to hold in 1993 a summit meeting on Africa's development.\nSimilarly, we look forward to the success of the second Programme of Action on Africa's Recovery and Economic Development. We pledge our full cooperation to the creation of the African Economic Community, in keeping with the Abuja guidelines - something which is both necessary and of vital importance for our region.\nWithout indulging in self-praise, I must say that the efforts of the Government of Equatorial Guinea for the well-being of the country, and hence of the human person, can be seen by anyone who wishes to visit the country. It is with deep pride and satisfaction that we learned of the international recognition, in the form of the Humberto Biancamano Prize, extended to His Excellency Obiang Hguema Mbasogo in Bata on 17 April 1991 by an international panel composed of representatives of the European Economic Community, the European Parliament, the Nobel Prize, university rectors, representatives of the international press and the Director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in connection with the efforts for political stability, democratisation and economic development of the country.\nOn behalf of the President of the Republic, the Government and the people, I wish to reiterate from this rostrum our thanks to these organizations and personalities.\nThe delegation of Equatorial Guinea recognizes and commends the positive changes made by the South African Government aimed at eradicating the system of apartheid, but we regret to note that it has not yet been completely eradicated. We cherish the hope that there will be good results from the negotiations on a non-racist and democratic constitution fully guaranteeing the fundamental rights of all South Africans, in keeping with the principle of one-man, one-vote.\nWe are concerned over the disturbances in the sister countries of Liberia, Ethiopia, Somalia and Rwanda, and we urge their leaders to reconsider their position:, and, through open and sincere dialogue, find solutions that restore peace, order and tranquillity.\nWe are convinced that peace In the Middle East cannot coexist with the persistent occupation of the Palestinian, Arab and Lebanese territories by Israel. The reality of the facts requires us to recognise both Israel and Palestine as free and sovereign States, each within its own recognized boundaries.\nWe harbour the hope that the holding of a peace conference, under the positive auspices of the Presidents of the United States and the Soviet Union, will calm passions and bring about a peaceful and lasting solution. We congratulate Lebanon on its having achieved national reconciliation. The international community should lend support and assistance to that country for its reconstruction. We resolutely support and praise the efforts of the Secretary-General with regard to the situation in Cyprus.\nWe most sincerely hope that the tragic and painful situation in Yugoslavia, a pioneer of the Non-Aligned Movement, will retain the attention of the international community so that \u00absolution acceptable to the parties can be found.\nThere is general agreement that military options are not the only or most desirable way to seek peace. Sivis pacem, para bellum - if you desire peace, prepare for war - has lost its validity.\nMy delegation welcomes the climate of peace and tranquillity promised by the political and economic negotiations, agreements, conventions and treaties aimed at establishing a common understanding between the sister countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, with which we are linked through language, culture and history. It is along this line of thinking that, without engaging\nin historical judgements or inquiring as to who is right or wrong, we urge the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba to open the doors to negotiations in order to arrive at solutions acceptable to the peoples on both sides, innocent victims of their rigid positions. That is an urgent requirement of the new era in which we find ourselves. The international community and history will praise and thank them for it. The United Nations is the appropriate forum and the time is right.\nDisarmament has always been the focus of our attention. Although we do not produce weapons nor possess them, as part of the international community, and since we might become their innocent victims, we wish to see their complete elimination. Therefore, we welcome and praise the unilateral initiative of the President of the United States, reciprocated by the President of the Soviet Union, to begin the process of their destruction and elimination. Of course, we must express our bitterness over the vast amounts of money spent on weapons; such resources could better serve to alleviate some of the many ills affecting mankind, but we take consolation in the saying \\\"Better late than never\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe are extremely happy to welcome the admission to membership of the United Nations at this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly the sister Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with which we share this moment of well-deserved jubilation; the Republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, to which we express again our desire to maintain our ties of friendship and collaboration with their emergence as independent countries; and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, and the Federated States of Micronesia.\nWe congratulate Ambassador Samir Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session and we assure him that our delegation will cooperate fully with him with a view to ensuring the success of his important work.\nToday's world hardly resembles yesterday's world. The global imbalance of forces in favour of hegemonic that led to a unipolar world aroused the concern of many countries - and not only the small and underdeveloped ones. There has been a rather fat file in the past few years on the use of force as a way of solving international conflicts. The so-called end of the cold war; the process of harmonization and cooperation between East and West; the collapse of socialism in Eastern and Central Europe; the structural crisis in the Soviet Union, which today is discussing what its future will look like; the fashioning of a single military super-Power, the United States - all this paints a very dangerous picture that greatly disturbs the poor and underdeveloped countries of the South. Yet we have to examine the complexities of this new reality in depth, without fear, realizing that over the long term there is no force in the world that can crush the desire for freedom and independence of any people, however small it may be. History is\nmade by the peoples; it is not simply written down on the maps at military headquarters.\nIt is true that the world has changed. But what has changed for the hundreds of millions of persons living in a state of dire poverty? In 1990 alone, 14 million children died of hunger, cold, and diseases that were curable. What has changed for the wretched economies of most of the countries of the third world, which are in debt and starving, living in a state of permanent crisis and subjected to the tortures of unequal terms of trade and the cruel pieties of the powerful?\nWe can be happy about the end of the East-West confrontation because it removes the danger of nuclear holocaust. But the East wants to become the North, and the South is still the South. The contradictions between the developed North and the underdeveloped South are increasing. Hence, we must ask ourselves: what can the poor people expect from this agreement between the powerful? That is the reality we must face.\nAt their recent Ministerial Conference held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries reaffirmed their decision to continue the struggle to ensure the realization of their original principles, and they stated that the problems of underdevelopment and poverty are among the major factors that can threaten peace and security. They added that without peace it is impossible to struggle for development, and without the development of the peoples of the developing countries of the world it is impossible even to conceive of honourable and real peace - peace for everyone. That is the peace that our people want - a worthy, real, honourable peace that will enable us to work for our development.\nThe United Nations must prepare itself to carry out, in these new conditions of the world today, the role set for it by its founders. Thus, it must go through a process of democratisation in all of its bodies, particularly those which, under the powers conferred on them by virtue of the Charter, have a greater role to play in carrying out some of the purposes that led to the establishment of the Organisation. Such is the case with the Security Council, which is governed by the anachronistic and dangerous veto power, which is an obstacle to the supreme functions of the General Assembly and which thereby makes a mockery of the will of the majority of the international community.\nThis process should apply to the economic and social sectors of the United Nations, given the very important role that the Organization has to play in the restructuring and changing of the current system of international economic relations, replacing them by a just and fair system.\nIt is necessary to revitalize the Secretariat and the intergovernmental mechanisms in the economic and social spheres, so that they may really be able to contribute to the socio-economic development of the developing countries through international cooperation. They would thereby be carrying out one of the basic purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nMoreover, we must work together to strengthen and revitalize the Economic and Social Council. A strengthened Council, with universal membership, would be better able to take up the new challenges that the pressing needs of the developing countries present, not only to the United Nations but to all of the bodies and agencies that are part of its system.\nThe United Nations must contribute in a definite way to the solution of several conflicts that are still weighing on the conscience of mankind.\nThe Palestinian people are still crying out for the right to exercise their Inalienable rights and to achieve an independent life as a sovereign State in Palestine. Cuba believes that the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, and with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel, is still the only real option that the international community has.\nWe welcome the progress made by the South African national liberation movement in its struggle to eradicate apartheid and achieve a majority government, a non-racial and democratic government, based on the principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\".\nSimilarly, we support the talks which, through the good offices of the Secretary-General, have been going on between the FMLN and the Government of El Salvador to find a real, lasting, peaceful solution to the tragedy of that brother people, without any outside interference or pressure. The agreement recently concluded in New York was an example of what can be accomplished through such talks. We would urge that by the year 2000 the process of decolonization be completed. It was begun just after the Second World War, with the accession to independence of all non-self-governing countries, and we would now welcome the accession to self-determination and independence of all, including our sister island of Puerto Rico, which is Latin American and Caribbean.\nWe support the Secretary-General's efforts to implement the United Nations agreements aimed at achieving a final solution to the conflicts in Cambodia and Afghanistan and the effective decolonization of Western Sahara.\nWe are encouraged here by the growing awareness of the need for unity and integration among the peoples of the third world. One great example of this was the recently concluded first Ibero-American summit conference in Guadalajara, Mexico. That was the first meeting in the history of those peoples that was convened and held apart from the will of the United States.\nWe would like to repeat here before the General Assembly what we said in the Security Council to the effect that the people of Yugoslavia must themselves, without foreign interference, settle the differences that they have, and they must thereby achieve lasting peace, ensuring the united and non-aligned nature of their country.\nHe must condemn the latest military coup in Haiti, which is seeking to reverse the democratic process which, only seven months ago, brought Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency. The people of Haiti, the first in Latin America and the Caribbean to achieve independence, will triumph over their enemies.\nTraditionally, when we have spoken from this rostrum we have focused on analysing the international situation and we have often referred to the situation in my own country. On this occasion we wish to speak about Cuba, for recent international events and the continuation of the aggressive, hysterical campaign by the United States Administration against Cuba oblige us to do so.\nThe expectations after the initial euphoria that some felt over the collapse of the socialist model as it was applied in Eastern Europe are growing daily - in particular, the expectations about this small but gigantic bastion of socialism that is called Cuba. So now, what is going to happen to Cuba? Enemies and friends of the Cuban revolution are asking this question. To disabuse the former, and as the latter are well aware, let us say to the \nAssembly that the Cuban revolution was not just the result of a little Christmas present. It did not come to Havana on a tank manned by foreigners: it came on war transportation which had been seized by our fighters from the enemies of the people. It was the culmination of a long process, 100 years of struggle, by our people for our freedom and independence.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly has on its agenda an item dealing with the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba, and so we feel it our duty to offer the Assembly some background information about that blockade and to describe to members some of its consequences.\nThe historical background of the blockade has to be sought in the promulgation on 17 May 1959 of the law on agrarian reform. That law helped 250,000 rural families, but it affected North American interests, who owned most of the land in our country. So immediately the United States Government began its policy of pressure, using its privileged economic relations to try to blackmail our people. February of 1962 the United States Government decided on a total trade embargo on Cuba, prohibiting the importing of products of Cuban origin and of all products from or through Cuba, and in 1964 it banned the supply of food and medicine, thus making it a total blockade. It has been estimated that the damage done to our economy over the 30 years of this blockade amounted to over $15 billion worth of resources.\nUnfortunately - although no well-informed person would be surprised by this - the result is that after listening to many persons speak here, who for various reasons support an end to the blockade against Cuba, since they consider it to be an anachronism and immoral, the North Americans decreed - even after this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly had begun - new provisions which go so far they make its coercive action against Cuba almost irrational.\nArbitrary economic limits have been imposed, first of all on United States companies involved in procedures and transportation that make it possible for Cubans who live on United States territory to meet with family members who live in Cuba. In the last few years, Cuba has established systematic and unequivocal measures to facilitate such meetings, and the North American Administration has taken a very hypocritical stand regarding them and has unleashed the vilest calumny. Yet now it is the United States that is using fallacious arguments virtually to cancel such meetings. This is a totalitarian and abusive action of State intervention and simply does not take into account the damaging consequences that it will have from the humanitarian standpoint.\nIn his statement to the General Assembly in 1960, President Fidel Castro stated that at the beginning of this century:\n\\\"After two years of military occupation of our country, something unexpected occurred. Just when the Cuban people, through a Constituent Assembly, were drafting the basic law of the Republic, another act was passed by the United States Congress, an act proposed by Senator Piatt, of unhappy memory for Cuba, in which it was laid down that a rider was to be attached to the Cuban Constitution whereby the United States Government would be granted the right to intervene in Cuban political affairs and, in addition, the right to lease certain parts of Cuban territory for naval bases or coaling stations.\\\" (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifteenth Session, Plenary Meetings, 872nd Meeting, para. $7).\nYears later, after a long struggle by the Cuban people, the Piatt Amendment was repealed, but the naval base at Guantanamo, which resulted from it during the North American military occupation of Cuba, is still on our territory. It is an affront to the national dignity of the Cuban people, and we have repeatedly demanded that the land illegally occupied in Cuba be returned to it.\nCuba's name has been mentioned several times during the general debate at this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In his far from brilliant debut as the supreme leader of the fate and actions of all the peoples on Earth, the North American President, who had promised representatives a different kind of speech, indulged in his usual anti-Cuban litany. Once again, he assumed the role of interpreter of the feelings of the Cuban people, giving free rein to this sick obsession with us. Nevertheless, it must be\nadmitted that, despite all his raving, this setting is a little more appropriate than the golf courses from which he usually pronounces judgements on major international events.\nIn his verdict - whose content is closely akin to the intolerance and ridicule of a neo-McCarthyism that is as far-reaching as the Inquisition was - the President of the United States condemned my country's social system, insulted our Government and offended our entire people. This is the new imperial Olympians' view of the new era of harmony and concord they want us to enter.\nIt is incredible that in these times and here in the United Nations those who are directly responsible for the existence in the world today of the most inhuman system of exploitation and plunder, which has plunged almost 100 nations into conditions of abject poverty never before experienced by mankind, should dare to preach sermons and lecture to us on democracy and human and political rights. It is incredible that those who want to make a crusade out of democracy have for years based their policies on force, threats, pressure and blackmail, have destabilized so many nations and States, have imposed dirty wars on them, have tried to bring them to their knees by hunger or economic violence, or have simply invaded them.\nIt is incredible that they are trying to sell us violence, exploitation, brutality and crime as a model for society. Those that defend the so-called intrinsic good of the market-economy system forget that almost all the underdeveloped countries are using that model and that for most of their peoples this has meant infinite wretchedness, unemployment, lack of health care, hunger, illiteracy, marginalization and the most horrible social scourges. They forget also that within this opulent North American society more than 33 million human beings, most of them black and Hispanic, are living\nin abject poverty; that millions of children are abandoned, abused or subjected to violence; that more and more old people are defenceless. They forget that this is the society with the highest crime rate in the world; that this is now the world centre for organizing that evil drug-trafficking chain which has become a virtual supra-national business; and that this is the major consular of cocaine, heroin, crack and marijuana in the world.\nPerhaps it is because our people know these facts that they so solidly, strongly and resolutely support our political system, our Government and our revolution.\nThe aim is to deny our people the right to live and work under the social system they have chosen through free and sovereign decisions such as the referendum in which 98 per cent of the Cuban people voted by secret ballot when our socialist Constitution was submitted to our population.\nEven under the conditions of underdevelopment from which we started, and even though for over 30 years we have been subjected to all kinds of aggression - the most brutal and inhuman form being the economic and trade blockade, which was designed to suffocate us - Cuba has had extraordinary success in the economic, political, social, scientific and cultural areas. Let me mention a few of our achievements: equality in a society in which all have equal rights and opportunities; safety; stability; social coexistence on a broad popular base; and forms of participatory democracy that are very strong and innovative. We can indeed say that ours is a society of solidarity and justice. Ethical and moral principles prevail and national dignity is an irreversible principle. Hence, we have a very deep spirit of internationalism, as is evident from the fact that we send thousands of doctors, technicians and teachers to work without pay in more than 30 countries of the third world.\nIn our country, the main social services, such as health, education and culture, are free. One hundred per cent of our people are entitled to social security. Income is distributed fairly and equitably and there is no exploitation or abuse. That is why we do not have children who are abandoned, who are beggars; we do not have old people who are defenceless; we do not have people who are marginalised. We have never encouraged consumerism. Our country has established an impressive social, health, education and production infrastructure. We can state that as a result of our revolution the people of Cuba have achieved a standard of living comparable to that of many developed countries - but in our country there are far fewer cases of violence, delinquency and crime and we do not produce, distribute or use drugs.\nThe United Nations Development Programme and such bodies as the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund which study the main social indicators at the international level have pointed out the indisputable fact that in these indicators Cuba is at a level similar to that of most developed countries, and on an even higher level than some of them. Some vital indicators, of transcendental social importance - such as infant mortality, mortality of children under the age of five, maternal mortality, life expectancy at birth, the number of people going to school, the number of people that stay in school, literacy, the number of doctors and teachers per capita, income distribution, caloric intake, and many others - are the result of the efforts made by a society whose primary objective is to ensure the well-being of its people.\nWe, of course, respect everyone's political beliefs and freedom of choice, but Cuba has not experienced such respect on the part of others. Until 1959 this system, which is so dogmatically being pushed today as the only possible formula, imposed on the Cuban people the most dreadful economic backwardness, a lack of basic individual and social rights and total neo-colonial dependency, poverty, illiteracy, ignorance and bloodthirsty tyranny - all of which enjoyed the consent and approval of the United States - in Cuba was synonymous with underdeveloped and dependent capitalism. And now we are being asked to return to that situation in the name of being up to date - just because the historical experiment in the old socialist States of Europe has failed - and in the same triumphant manner as the feudal lords returned to their old palaces after reinstatement.\nThe Cuban Revolution, which was won in spite of the blockade and the hostility against it, can no doubt be improved, as can any human undertaking. However, it is the closest we have come in our history towards achieving social justice and national dignity.\nWe will never abandon it. We will improve it ourselves. The overwhelming majority of Cubans will do so despite the cynical arrogance of the President of a country whose wealth is derived from plunder and oppression.\nOne of our dearest aspirations is to ensure greater popular and democratic participation in adopting all the vital decisions and in consolidating our social co-existence which is unprecedented in Cuba's history because it is founded on justice and equity. These aspirations reflect our true national consensus, which we would be able to achieve more speedily were it not for the 30 years of economic blockade, hostile actions, efforts made to isolate and condemn us unjustly before the international community and for all kinds of pressures and a permanent threat of military aggression.\nThere are other references to Cuba that can be ignored. Having already commented upon the point of view behind the American broadsides, I do not believe that I should take up the Assembly's time to exercise the right of reply to a statement, hastily and awkwardly translated into Spanish, based on the Yankee arguments against Cuba which, unfortunately, were read out in Spanish from this very rostrum.\nMy delegation, however, would like to state for the record that we have great respect, among other well-known statesmen and colleagues, for the President of Venezuela, Mr. Carlos Andres Perez, owing to his unquestioned courage and his consistent approach when in addressing the Assembly he spoke of his approach in the search for an end to the confrontation between the United States and Cuba.\nIt is no secret that, in addition to sharing views with Venezuela, there are also differing political views between us. But this does not prevent us from having a useful and constructive relationship with such an important country in our region.\nWe can distinguish between those who call for changes but merely want the example of Cuba to disappear and those who are genuinely concerned about the future of our country.\nTo the fraternal President of Venezuela, we say that Cuba is always willing to consider its differences with the United States without preconditions of any type, on the basis of equality and mutual respect, even apart from the fact that one cannot equate Cuba - a besieged, harassed and blockaded country that is being asked to change - with the United States, the most powerful country in the world.\nAs members know, the President of the Soviet Union recently stated unilaterally that he was willing to withdraw what he called the Soviet Armed Forces Training Brigade from our country.\nSince our people chose the path to independence, in 1959, and decided to exercise its sovereign rights, we have suffered not only from threats but also from aggression of all kinds. Under those prevailing circumstances, when the then leaders of the Soviet Union suggested that missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads should be stationed in Cuba, our acceptance was motivated not only by the legitimate right to defend ourselves with arms equal to those of the countries that threatened us but also by the feeling that we would thus be contributing to strengthening the socialist camp and, in particular, the Soviet Union, at a time when the threat of imperialist aggression was becoming real and that that decision could have made it possible to avoid such an attack.\nIn the days of the October crisis, the Revolutionary Government, through the statement by its Prime Minister of 28 October 1962, set forth the five points that it deemed to be essential in order to guarantee genuine peace in Cuba:\n\\\"First, a halt to the economic blockade and all measures of trade and economic pressure applied by the United States in all parts of the world against our country;\nSecondly, a halt to all subversive activities, the launch and landing of weapons and explosives by air and sea, the organization of invasions by mercenaries, the infiltration of spies and saboteurs - activities against us launched from the territory of the United States and of some collaborating countries; Thirdly, a halt to pirate-like attacks launched from existing bases in the United States and Puerto Rico;\nFourthly, a halt to all violations of our air and naval space by United States warships and aircraft;\nFifthly, withdrawal from the Guantanamo naval base, and the return of Cuban territory occupied by the United States.\\\"\nAs a result of that crisis, and after the unilateral decision taken by the Government of the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles from Cuba, the Governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union decided to keep a Soviet military unit on Cuban territory. The unit was symbolic, for its forces were never strong enough to defend Cuba; however, it was an expression of friendship and solidarity, given the threats from the United States.\nWhen in 1979, after a period of 17 years, the United States, as part of its vain attempts to prevent the convening in Cuba of the Sixth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, exposed the presence in Cuba of a Motorized Brigade of the Soviet Armed Forces, the then Soviet leadership, without prior consultation with our Government, yielded to American pressure and made statements that, with the acceptance of the American authorities, in theory transformed that combat unit, which was to be activated in case of invasion from the United States, into a supposedly harmless study centre.\nThe presence of the Soviet military contingent in Cuba, which continued to be a combat unit, retaining all its military means and missions, would not have been necessary had we secured genuine guarantees for a lasting peace, which could have been achieved if only the demands our Government made in 1962 in the \\\"five points\\\" I have referred to had been acceded to - and these points retain their validity to this day. If, at least, the case for withdrawal from\nthe Guantanamo naval base had been adequately made, there would be no American or Soviet troops in Cuba today.\nThe guarantees we called (or still do not exist.\nThe Government of Cuba would be prepared to accept the simultaneous withdrawal from our country of the Soviet and American military personnel. In the circumstances, this would be the only equitable, just and honourable way\nout.\nThe United States has not discarded the option of a major attack against Cuba. While spokesmen of the Department of State and some officials of the Bush Administration assure us publicly and through the diplomatic channel that they have no aggressive intentions or plans vis-\u00e0-vis Cuba, the Pentagon thinks and acts quite differently.\nWe invite all those who believe the promises of the Bush Administration to ask their representatives what are the contingency plans behind the military exercises of the 101st Airborne Division that began on 16 December and, as scheduled by the Pentagon, will continue until 16 0ctober7\nFor 35 days, in Fort Chafee, Arkansas, the so-called Screeching Eagles will participate in a low-intensity-conflict scenario, which will gradually escalate to a medium-intensity level, in a place of dense vegetation, against an enemy that uses tactics similar to those of the Soviets. Where does the Pentagon think that such conditions might exist, if not in Cuba?\nThe peace that we want is real peace - a peace of dignity, a peace that will be for all States, large and small, weak and powerful.\nSpeaking from this rostrum 31 years ago. President Fidel Castro said: \\\"When we small countries seek to be free, we know that we must become free by our own efforts and at our own risk. When a people is united and is defending a just cause, it can trust in its own strength. In Cuba we are not, as we have been alleged to be, a group of men governing a country. We are a people governing a country, an entire nation resolutely united in an unshakeable revolutionary spirit in defence of its rights. This is something that the enemies of the revolution and of Cuba should know for if they ignore it they are grievously mistaken.\\\" (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifteenth Session, Plenary Meetings, 872nd meeting, para 132)\nOn that occasion President Castro said also:\n\\\"With all due respect to this Organization, I must say that our people, the people of Cuba, have learned much; they are, and I say this with pride, equal to the task they are undertaking, to the heroic struggle they are waging; they have learnt, a lesson from recent international events and they know that at the eleventh hour, when their rights have been denied, when the forces of aggression are marshalled against them, when their rights are not protected either in the Organization of American States or in the United Nations, there still remains to them the ultimate and heroic remedy of resistance.\\\" (ibid., para. 131) This has been our position of principle. It has been stated and it has been applied over the past 38 years. This traditional policy has been fully supported by our people. With their weapons in their hands, they are willing to defend our independence, our freedom, our right to have the social system that we want, the system that suits our needs and our interests.\nThe defence of our revolution has been based on the principle of the involvement of all the people. It has been based on the involvement of all our citizens in the defence of our country, on their being part of our armed forces, our people's militias, because they are absolutely convinced that any enemy daring to invade our country will not find an absence of resistance anywhere, will have not a moment without struggle, not a moment's respite, until the enemy has left our country. No enemy will ever be able to crush or corrupt us. Our people - the authors of the Cuban revolution - have proclaimed a thousand times that they will continue our work because they know that our battle is part of the struggle for true independence, freedom and development for all peoples. We shall hold high the flag of socialism, which our country defends. We shall defend our nationality. We shall continue to hold our socialist principles - socialism or death; our country or death - because we know that we shall triumph.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, we congratulate you on your election to preside over the General Assembly at this forty-sixth session. Tour diplomatic skills and experience are well known, as is your commitment to the principles and ideals of the United Nations. We look forward to a productive session under your capable leadership and congratulate the Government and people of Saudi Arabia as well.\nWe also congratulate Sir Michael Somare, the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea; Mr. George Iacovou, the Foreign Minister of Cyprus; and Mr. Abdalla Saleh Al-Ashtal, the Permanent Representative of Yemen. Each has made his own unique contributions to world peace and understanding. Each has dignified and contributed to the strengthening of the international democratic process here at the United Nations.\nWe also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Foreign Minister of Malta. He proved to be well suited to the task of guiding our deliberations in this new era in international relations.\nWe join in commending the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. He and other members of the Secretariat have laboured tirelessly on behalf of the international community in its search for justice and peace. It is therefore fitting and symbolic that near the end of the Secretary-General's tenure, seven new Members should be admitted to membership in the world body.\nThe simultaneous admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea bodes well for the future of the Korean people and enhances the prospects for lasting peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. The restoration of the sovereignty of the Baltic Republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, closes a sad chapter in human history, and offers new hope to others who await the restoration of their own sovereignty.\nThe admission of our Pacific neighbours, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, further attests to the universality of the United Nations and to the continued relevancy of the international community's focus on Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories. We congratulate all seven of the new Members. More importantly, we congratulate the United Nations on what each of these seven new Members symbolises, and on the qualities each brings to the Organisation.\nOn occasion, human history moves faster than the hands of those who would write that history. So much has transpired in recent months that the scribes of history have barely had time to allow the ink to dry before having to turn the page and begin anew. In some instances the scribes have not even had time to turn the page.\nAfter a brief visit to Haiti, democracy has once again been \\\"exiled\\\" by those who have continually brutalized the people of that impoverished country. Only a few days after he stood at this very podium and articulated his people's plea for justice, Haiti's President and the dream of his people were driven into exile. However, it is our belief that this will be a short \\\"exile\\\" and that Haiti's people will soon restore their democracy and claim their future. He wonder how those who have assaulted Haiti's democracy expect to succeed in the face of the new expectations of Haiti's people and the broad international support which exists for that country's legitimately elected President.\nAlso freshly inscribed on the pages of history are a number of positive developments. Among them, are Guatemala's recognition of Belize and the establishment of diplomatic relations between these two Central American neighbours. The broad agreement between the President of El Salvador and the five leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation front is another very positive development. This agreement could lead to a truce in that country's long civil war and eventually help bring economic and social justice to that country's beleaguered people.\nCambodia has also taken a huge step towards securing a brighter future for its people. The Supreme National Council of Cambodia has taken several initiatives that could lead to an era of peace and national reconciliation. The permanent members of the Security Council and the Paris International Conference on Cambodia have contributed significantly to this process. Hopefully, the Secretary-General's five-point plan on Afghanistan will inspire the parties to that conflict similarly to negotiate a framework for a comprehensive political Battlement.\nThe ink of history is not yet dry on other parts of the globe either. One year ago the United Nations was justifiably preoccupied with an effort to re-write history by turning the pages of history back to the era of \\\"might make right\\\". Fortunately the international community rose to the occasion and Kuwait is now free of foreign occupation. However, the people of that regime, particularly those of Kuwait and Iraq, paid a terrible price. Our hearts go out to them. Others also paid a terrible price. Our hearts go out to them as well.\nAs important a step as the liberation of Kuwait was, it will lose its moral and legal significance unless the international community consistently applies the same principles everywhere. We must always judge the act and not the actor. Should we fail to do so, we can rightfully be accused of having a double standard. \nPrinciples which are selectively applied are not really principles but ere instead mere expedients. Therefore the United Nations should act in a comprehensive and consistent manner in circumstances similar to those which existed in Kuwait one year ago. Had the international community been consistent prior to the invasion of Kuwait, it is doubtful whether that invasion and the death and destruction it brought about would have occurred.\nYears of inaction and the lack of resolve on the issue of Palestine and the occupied Arab territories are examples of the inconsistency that does little to enhance respect for the rule of law. The deafening silence on the question of East Timor by some who spoke so eloquently on the invasion of Kuwait is, to a country as small and vulnerable as Vanuatu, another frightening reminder of the inconsistency exhibited by some members of the international community.\nThe recent initiative taken towards the convening of an international conference on the Middle East enjoys broad support and may set in motion a process of negotiations that will lead to a comprehensive political settlement. He certainly hope such a chapter of history will soon be written.\nWith respect to East Timor, we are pleased that a delegation of Portuguese parliamentarians is about to make a visit to the Territory. He hope this visit will contribute to a settlement which will eventually allow East Timor's people to decide their own fate and write their own history.\nWe are encouraged by the prospect that Western Sahara's people will soon determine their own destiny and write their own page in the history of the United Nations. Equally encouraging is the positive and peaceful atmosphere that now exists in Lebanon. \nThe decolonisation process, particularly that under way in Mew Caledonia, continues to be a major concern of the countries of our region. The positive measures taken by France to assure tranquillity in the Territory and to promote the economic and social development of its colonised people are much appreciated. What will be even more appreciated will be the moment New Caledonia gains its independence and joins the community of nations, as did two neighbouring Pacific Island countries at this session of the General Assembly. That will certainly be a joyous moment of history.\nDemocratic winds of change are also sweeping across Africa, from North to South and East to West. While much of the attention of the international news media has been focused on Eastern Europe, Africa has also witnessed important new historic developments. The ruins have fallen silent In Angola, where a full-scale military conflict has given way to what will, hopefully, be a purely peaceful political contest. Liberia may still be troubled but, hopefully, it has now turned the corner and will soon leave its most difficult days behind, as will Ethiopia and a number of other African countries whose peoples have endured more than their share of hardship and suffering. \nThe institutional structure of apartheid continues to dissolve in the face of continued resistance by South Africa's people. The end of legalised apartheid will by no means end the problems of that country. Economic, political and social inequality are so deeply ingrained that it will take decades of concerted effort to remove the vestiges of the apartheid system. Hopefully, the international community will not abandon South Africa's people merely because those who currently govern that country now find themselves compelled to offer a series of reforms. Events are moving very fast in South Africa. New history is being written every day. However, as in other parts of the world, the past cannot be ignored in shaping the future.\nWith the danger of ideological conflict having receded in some parts of the world, there has been a tragic reversion to an older and more frightening type of conflict. On more than one occasion, the world has been warned of the dangers of inter-communal conflict and ethnic strife. For far too long those words of warning fell on deaf ears. Some insisted that this issue was strictly an internal affair of various countries. Others insisted that this was too sensitive an issue to discuss at international forums.\nWhile fully respecting national sovereignty and recognising the domestic dimensions of inter-communal conflict and ethnic strife, we often wondered what it would take to make some members of the international community aware of the serious threat posed to all nations by such conflict and strife. Unfortunately, we now have the answer.\nOne need not single out any particular country or any particular region. Inter-communal conflict and ethnic strife are problems which plague the entire human race in every corner of the globe. Ho human being should ever be judged, or assigned a particular status, because of his or her race, religion language or culture. When hatred of this sort runs rampant, none of us is immune to the consequences.\nLarge countries and small countries can be victims of this hatred. Developed countries and developing countries can equally be victims. This hatred can be witnessed in parts of the world that are geographically remote from where we now sit. It can also be witnessed within a short distance of this very building.\nOne can examine our agenda and identify certain long-standing items that, in part, originated as inter-communal conflict or ethnic strife. History will indeed judge us harshly should we fail to address this issue and assert moral leadership on it, thus bequeathing our failure to future generations. It would certainly be ironic for history to record that the current generation dismantled physical walls or barriers but left standing other types of walls. Unfortunately, the latter type of barrier - that of ignorance, intolerance and ethnic hatred - is far more difficult to breach.\nThe rapidity with which history occasionally moves was recently illustrated in dramatic fashion. One week ago the President, of the United States announced a sweeping initiative which could for ever alter what had, since the dawn of the atomic age, been accepted as the normal rules of arms control. The announcement that the United States would unilaterally eliminate its land-based short-range nuclear weapons, withdraw its tactical nuclear arms from its ships, take its strategic bombers off alert, and cancel the development of the mobile MX missile represents another benchmark in the evolving relationship between the world's two foremost nuclear Powers. An equally dramatic response from Moscow is anticipated in the next few days.\nOne might legitimately wonder whether recent political events and technological developments had already made some of these weapons obsolete or superfluous. One might also ponder the costs and environmental consequences of eliminating these frightening weapons. None the less, President Bush's announcement just might give new impetus to efforts to rid the world of the threat posed by all types of nuclear weapons.\nThis initiative leads us to ask, once again, why nuclear weapons are being tested in the South Pacific despite the repeated objections of the countries of the region. The testing of these weapons in the South Pacific was always opposed on safety, moral and environmental grounds. Today there Is even less reason to understand the need for these tests. There are even more compelling reasons for our repeated appeals for their end to finally be heeded.\nThe international political climate is not the only climate that is changing. The climate that determines the sustainability of life on this planet, and the level of social and economic development achievable by human beings is also changing. This latter climate change has been occurring since the dawn of the industrial era, although at a somewhat slower, less perceptible pace than changes in the political climate. None the less, its impact will undoubtedly be greater than the impact of any political changes known to mankind.\nThe Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change is currently engaged in what could be considered the most important multilateral negotiations ever. The outcome of these negotiations might, in the long run, determine whether human life can continue to be sustained on this planet. The negotiations might also shape the manner in which mankind's economic activities are conducted. It is difficult to imagine more important subject-matter. \nEvery country in the world is participating in these negotiations. It is hoped that the negotiations will be successfully concluded in time for the convention to be opened for signature at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) at Rio de Janeiro in June of 1992.\nAll countries have a great deal at stake in the negotiations leading up to the Conference. Environmental issues and economic issues are interrelated and of equal importance. Small, island developing countries and low-lying coastal countries have another concern - survival. These are the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise caused by global warming. As such, they are likely to be the first victims should the international community fail to agree on a collective response to mankind's most severe challenge.\nMuch remains to be done to ensure the successful completion of the negotiations for a climate-change convention. Even more remains to be done to ensure that the UHCED is meaningful and successful. Hopefully, the United Nations system and Member States will spare no effort in providing adequate support to ensure the success of these parallel processes. We shudder to think of the consequences of our failure to do so.\nMuch of the change taking place in the world today revolves around principles of democracy and the commitment to democratic ideals. Democracy and democratic ideals are not constants which once planted can be ignored or left to their own devices. Democracy and democratic ideals are, rather, like a garden in need of constant care and attention. They must be fed and nurtured or they can wither and die, or even be overgrown by weeds disguised as flowers. We know of no instance in history in which democracy was very easily established. Instead, the establishment of democracy took considerable effort and years of turmoil and unrest in even the oldest of democracies. It will take similar effort in today's evolving democracies. Ho nation in the world has a perfect democracy. No nation in the world has a monopoly on democratic ideals. Certainly, no nation has a history which allows it to lecture others on the subject: or hold itself up as a perfect model to be emulated in every respect.\nFrom time to time, democracy and a nation's adherence to democratic ideals are tasted. This is as true of nations as large and powerful as the Soviet Union or the United States as it is of nations as small and removed from the centres of power as Vanuatu. We believe that eventually, in all such instances, democracy will triumph. History instructs us that people everywhere, and the evolution of the human experience, will accept nothing less.\nThe United Nations is today the highest form of international democracy. It is not yet a perfect international democracy. Its imperfections and shortcomings are known to all. What are sometimes forgotten, however, are its very positive attributes and its many accomplishments. In the history of mankind, there has never been any international or intergovernmental organisation as democratic or as successful as the United Nations.\nThus, as we undertake the work of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and take one additional step towards the twenty-first century, let us feed and nurture our garden of international democracy. Let us reflect upon and recommit ourselves to the democratic ideals which have brought us together in search of justice, equality and peace.\nIn a symbolic sense, our seven new Members have entered the Organisation at the right moment in history. They can be an important new source of energy and nutrition for our garden of international democracy.\nIn conclusion, we recall the moving words of a Mozambican poet written 2C years ago during his country's struggle to free itself from colonialism. Although those words were written at a different time, in a different place, and under circumstances different from those which exist today, they still bear a certain symbolic relevancy to mankind's mutual undertakings of today.\nWe hope these words can be understood and appreciated in that context. They are simple words of compassion for fellow human beings. In their simplicity, they reveal many truths: \n\\\"So man; paths we have trodden already! So many people we have greeted liberate clothed fed taught\nAlong our march!\nSo many plains, mountains, rivers we have crossed! It is still far the day of independence, but each passing day it is nearer. ...\nWe advance-instruments of an ideal\nloftier than ourselves\nReleased from our former solitude.\nSometimes we pause by the wayside Attracted by a child who bails us, a chance-born flower, a certain smile, a distant star.\nWe pause within ourselves; our steps continue and we meet again further on. He cannot be late. There, the enemy continues to enslave our people \nTo arms Comrades!\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring the Assembly most sincere greetings from the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and deem it an esteemed pleasure and a distinct honour to address this our forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nI join in all sincerity with those who have preceded me in congratulating the former President, Guido de Marco of Malta, on his skilful handling of our past deliberations during a period of unprecedented challenges. Then I hasten to welcome our new President, Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, whom I wish to assure of my country's firm support and continued cooperation. The very astute way in which you have been guiding this session, Mr. President, deserves our highest commendation and portends well for a successful and fruitful forty-sixth session.\nNext, I wish to pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who continues to serve cur Organization with demonstrative dignity, elegance, and excellence, amidst difficult and trying times. His focus has always been International peace and security for the peoples of the world. His leadership has been masterful In a period of great upheaval and tremendous change.\nMr. Secretary-General, my Government, and people salute you; we stand In awe of your indefatigable commitment; and we pledge our support as you continue to serve the international community in the proficient and effective manner to which we have grown accustomed.\nThere have been times in the past when the relevance of the United Nations has been questioned, when the will of its Members to be resolute in defence of the weak has been in doubt. Not anymore. This assembly of nations has acted to ensure the restoration of sovereignty to one of its smaller Members, Kuwait, and the world looks on with appreciation. Most are supportive, some are still derisive, none remain indifferent. The United Nation system is experiencing its finest hour - still, it is a time of enormous challenge and opportunity.\nThe vibrancy of the Assembly is reflected in the plethora of new Members. Saint Kitts and Nevis was warmly received into this body, and today I deem it a pleasure and an honour to extend a warm welcome to the new Members. I welcome the Republic of Korea, our friends of long standing, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. An is well known, my Government has consistently advocated the admission of both countries for several years. I welcome the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, as well 33 the Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. I am pleased to assure the Governments and peoples of these new Members that my Government and people will extend to them most active cooperation in the cause of world peace and human development.\nWhile democracy is breaking out all over the world, somehow the beleaguered people of Haiti continue to be denied the opportunity to breathe the pure air of freedom. My country, Saint. Kitts and Mavis, and indeed the entire Caribbean community, are deeply shocked by the action of the armed forces in Haiti in illegally sailing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and members of his administration and usurping the authority of the duly constituted Government. This monstrous and outrageous action by the Haitian military is an unacceptable repudiation of the declared will of the people of Haiti, which was overwhelmingly and unambiguously manifested in the elections of December 1990.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and indeed the entire Caribbean community, unreservedly condemn this flagrant assault on the unfolding democratic process in Haiti, and demand the restoration of constitutional order and of Father Aristide to the presidency of the Republic.\nThe Caribbean community has in the past called for concerted international assistance to consolidate democratic gains in Haiti. We repeat that call today. The Caribbean community is working within the Organization of American States to restore democracy to Haiti.\nI call on this body, the United Nations, which has acted decisively in other areas of crisis, to move with urgency and purpose to ostracize the illegal regime in Haiti and to take all appropriate measures to restore democracy and the constitutionally elected Government in Haiti.\nThe people of Haiti cry out in anguish to the world community for deliverance. Let us not fail them this time. I wish to focus today on the subject of development through peace as the basis for the new international order.\nEast-West tension has abated; the Berlin Wall has fallen beneath the surge of freedom; Kuwait has been liberated; some challenges to democracy are being thwarted; and diplomacy and negotiation are more and more being accepted as alternatives to violence and bloodshed.\nThe Initiative taken by President Bush of the United States of America to implement a unilateral reduction of nuclear weapons Is timely and welcome. The response of President. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union is a further significant contribution to the reduction of International tensions. We must now seize the opportunity of the moment and work towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\nHowever, world peace must not be viewed only In terms of the absence of world war, the elimination of East-West tension or the achievement of cease fires. The concept of world peace must be far more fundamental and pervasive. It must mean an acceptance of human equality and dignity, the achievement of social justice and the global preservation of Individual human rights. The world must work as assiduously at building the foundations of peace as it did at erecting the bastions of war.\nThe enhancement of education, the eradication of poverty, the reduction of unemployment, the maintenance of good health, the provision of affordable housing, the adapting of science and technology to socio-economic development - these must be the dividends that flow from diverting global financial resources away from the amassing of armaments, to be invested in human development. This is the challenge we face. This is the new battle we must join - and we must not fail.\nThe development of all our peoples through peace must be placed against the backdrop of the need for a comprehensive political settlement, of disputes, self determination through free and fair elections and full respect for national sovereignty, together with the repatriation and rehabilitation of displaced persons balanced against continuing violence, social unrest and grave civil strife in several regions.\nMoreover, three specific global issues present themselves. I refer here firstly to the risk that certain development programmes may lead to great environmental damage. Secondly, I note that the drug menace is presenting a lasting threat to the welfare of the young people who constitute the productive sector of all nations. Finally, I add to these our ever-increasing ability to cause human and material destruction. I am worried most of all by the fact that we do not seem to have found a way to control the development and spread of such technology.\nThese issues represent security problems which are just as dangerous as any act of open hostility. They reflect a disturbing level of uncertainty. Despite positive global changes, they add up to a host of problems which no one country can solve alone. They are all likely to lead to disputes. The only way we can stop these turning into open war, I believe, is for us to act in unity. Therefore we need to identify security concerns in a global context. If that can be done, then we must work together to find solutions. I see those two needs as crucial.\nAs I have said, I do not overlook the positive developments we have seen in the post-cold-war period. They have offered signs that it is possible for us to move forward together. I think that the recent announcements made by the Presidents of the United States and the Soviet Union about reducing nuclear arms are most welcome initiatives. So are the encouraging responses given by other nuclear Powers. They indicate that a new process is under way. I believe that it may start to answer the repeated calls for action in this area which have been made by many United Nations Members.\nThe intransigence of Iraq continues to cause disquiet in the international community. We must maintain appropriate sanctions until the relevant resolutions of the Security Council have been implemented in full and until the people of Iraq, as well as their neighbours, can live without fear of intimidation from either conventional or nuclear armaments.\nSouth Africa continues to be another area of grave concern to us. While we welcome the steps taken by the De Klerk Administration to dismantle the pillars of apartheid, we must keep in mind that apartheid is not ended. Until there is equality and respect for individual rights, regardless of race, our objective has not been achieved. The ultimate objective must continue to be the achievement of one person, one vote. We cannot accept one standard of freedom and democracy for people in Europe and the Americas, and a lesser standard of freedom and democracy for the people of South Africa.\nThe people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and, indeed, the Caribbean community, will maintain our principled stand of continuing sanctions against the regime in South Africa, and we oppose the wholesale lifting of sanctions at this time. He consider the lifting of sanctions now to be premature, and caution that it could result in delaying the inevitable end of apartheid. I call on the international community not to retreat when the end is in sight. I call on the international community not to abandon the oppressed people of South Africa at this critical time, but to stand fast until justice, equality and freedom become realities for all.\nDemocracy and individual rights and freedoms are all part of our Caribbean way of life. We want nothing less for our African brothers and sisters. \nIt is cause for deep concern that peace and justice continue to elude the people of Cambodia. They, too have a right to aspire to the fruits of economic development. We call for all constructive efforts to continue until the reaching of a settlement which brings m and to conflict and ushers in an era of development.\nMy Government supports the new direction towards fundamental reform and democratisation in the Soviet Union. It has undoubtedly contributed to the removal of East-West tensions, r development that has been received with a global sigh of relief.\nI have no doubt that there will be a major mobilization of financial, technical and material resources to assist with the economic transformation of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This is as it should be. However, the United Nations must be particularly vigilant to ensure that the socio-economic problems of developing countries, like mine, are not marginalized and relegated to the backwater of human development. There must be a redirection of resources, and a mobilization of additional resources, away from the economy of war to the economy of development.\nThe United Nations must be an instrument of peacemaking and enhancement of the quality of life. The Organization can thus direct and coordinate responses to the developmental needs of small States. We need an Organization that remains committed to the sustained growth and development of all of its Member States, in order to build and maintain a world partnership. \nWe must, therefore, commit ourselves to reinforcing the multilateral approach to the solution of our problems. It behoves us to strengthen the international system of which the United Nations forms the nucleus. The international community must rally around the system if it is to fulfil its obligation to restore and ensure international peace and security in order that economic and socio-cultural development may prosper, blows, and bear good fruit.\nThe issue of development and the environment is so fundamental to the achievement of a better quality of life that I must address it. It is axiomatic that all of us share a responsibility for protecting and preserving the environment. It seems, however, that in this regard some countries are more equal than others.\nIn 1966, a major airline manufacturer found it necessary to destroy 630 acres of lush forest to establish a factory complex. This was a case of development taking priority over environment. The significant development value of that decision is totally accepted and unquestioned today. On the other side of the ledger, however, we find the disturbing trend where environmental questions, sometimes real and sometimes imagined, are becoming major conditionalities attached to development assistance for poor countries. Are we to understand that development must take priority over environment in developed countries, but that the environment must take precedence over development in developing countries that are being strangled by a hostile world economic system?\nThe ensuring of environmental protection and development must not run counter to a country's strategies for socio-economic advancement. There must be a balance between environmental concerns and a country's overall\ndevelopment so that environmental issues ought not to become a deterrent to development in the poorer countries.\nAdditionally, it must be appreciated that environmental concerns differ from country to country, and from region to region. In the developed world the accent is on issues like the ozone layer, acid rain and toxic waste. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, however, we need direct assistance in the areas of solid and liquid waste management, marine life protection, beach conservation, reef preservation, the prevention of coastal erosion, and the full integration of marine resources into the national development plans.\n\nI must at this point make particular reference to the Caribbean, stretching from Belize to Guyana, and linked by small, island developing States from the Bahamas to Trinidad.\nWe are a string of pearls linking North and South America, beautiful but vulnerable. We are vulnerable to natural disasters, vulnerable to global economic developments over which we have no control. He are vulnerable to an international economic order that determines and sets at a low level the prices of the things we sell, and escalates the prices of the things we buy. We find ourselves consigned to a treadmill of poverty, debt, and underdevelopment.\nHowever, because of our location close to the Americas, and the cross-fertilisation of cultures and values, fuelled by the revolution in electronics and communication, our people have developed high expectations. We have helped ourselves considerably through individual and regional effort, and international support.\nWhile our location provides, on the one hand, opportunities for development, particularly in tourism which is important for all of us, it is also a source of great challenge and danger. We are also vulnerable to the narco-terrorists, the drug traffickers. Together we must continue to wage all-out war on these purveyors of death and destruction. We continue to need more assistance in reducing demand through education, health care, and rehabilitation, and we must intensify our combined efforts in the area of interdiction and enforcement.\nAt this time when the attention of the international community is taken up by events of monumental proportions throughout the world, I feel I must endeavour to keep the development concerns of island developing nations on the international agenda. There have also been positive developments in our region in relations between neighbours. I must commend the Governments of Belize and Guatemala on having reconciled their differences in the interest of good neighbourliness. The declaration that Guatemala recognizes Belize as an independent State not only allows Belize to participate fully in the Central American integration process but gives a tremendous boost to Caribbean-Central American relations. My Government looks with optimism to the prospect of both Governments' continuing negotiations so as to iron out remaining difficulties, in the interest of peaceful coexistence between the two countries.\nIn addition, my Government commends the United Nations and the Organisation of American States on the role they have played and will continue to play in providing avenues through which workable solutions can be found to territorial disputes.\nAt this time in our history we are seriously challenged to bring an end to conflicts and to stimulate a resurgence of human development. Within the parameters of this broad objective, there must be a place for special attention to be given to the welfare of our children. We gave that process special emphasis when we met here at the special Heads of State and Government Summit for Children. Let us commit and re-dedicate ourselves to rise to the challenge of making peace mean development for people everywhere, but let as make it specially meaningful for our children as we provide for their health, educational, recreational and psychological needs. In this we can have no nobler objective.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by congratulating Ambassador Shihabi on his election to the office of President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which I hope will be crowned with success. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, on his endeavours and his valuable contribution to the promotion of world peace and understanding among nations.\nIn this era of heightened expectations of freedom and of peace among nations, the threat of despotism has not yet disappeared from the world. This Assembly convenes in the aftermath of two crises that threatened human freedoms and that aroused profound concern throughout the enlightened international community. Future historians will undoubtedly cast more light on these two grim chapters in the closing years of this century from an appropriate perspective. But we, representatives of Governments, do not have the time to indulge in the luxury of observing events passively, as historians can do.\nWe are making history, not writing it, making history here and now. It is incumbent upon us as representatives of responsible Governments to mould current events in a spirit of respect for the values our democratic regimes represent, and aspiring to a world order based on universal freedoms.\nWe must draw the correct conclusions and apply the lessons of the crises of the past year and bequeath to all mankind a code of conduct, thus ensuring that our world will no longer be exposed to insane outbursts of tyranny. Our lesson from the two recent crises is that there is an unequivocal link between the nature of political regimes and the peace and stability of the world.\nDemocratic government is based on the recognition of civil liberties and on respect for the sovereignty of other nations. Democracy is the natural condition of a healthy society. It would be the preferred system for all mankind, were it free to choose. Man was born to freedom; it is part of his intrinsic nature. He was born to live, not to fight wars; to create, not to destroy. The spirit of freedom is embedded in the human intellect and the law of the jungle is alien to it. Therein lies the superiority of man over creatures that are devoid of the power of choice. \\\"Live and let live\\\" is the voice of human reason. \\\"When one saves a human life it is as if one has saved all of humanity,\\\" runs an ancient Jewish saying.\nThese basic truisms have thrust themselves to the fore during recent years, when a new dawn has broken in the Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe. Seventy years of an oppressive regime could not suppress man's spirit of freedom. That spirit has arisen anew and broken its chains after three generations of independence denied. Now that the wind of freedom has been liberated no power on Earth can ever return it to captivity.\nWe saw this with our own eyes in the 70 hours of the abortive coup in the Soviet Union. We could have anticipated the end of that coup from the moment a small group of citizens first appeared in the streets of Moscow to face the approaching tanks. They stood against them unarmed, like a human banner, and the soldiers did not shoot. The army held its fire, faced as it was with the spirit of freedom that had taken root even among its own ranks. When the muse of freedom sang, the guns fell silent.\nThat is the lesson the world has drawn from the crisis of August 1991. Yet it learned another bitter and rapid lesson from the Persian Gulf crisis of August 1990. It learned how short-sighted it had been in supplying, over the years and without any controls, vast quantities of weapons to a dictatorial regime. It has learned just how terrifying can be the combination of military power and a lack of inhibition regarding its use. The chameleon that had bemused the entire enlightened world turned into a lethal python that wound itself around mankind's neck.\nThe billows of black smoke that rose from hundreds of oil wells across the Kuwaiti desert are a living and tangible illustration of the evil genie that had escaped from its bottle, throwing a huge pall over entire continents. Tyranny - and the tyrant - displayed an undreamed-of vitality.\nSaddam Hussein has not been removed from the world scene. His defeated people have not rejected him. The Kurdish revolt has been brutally suppressed, leaving in its wake hundreds of thousands of homeless refugees. The scale of military strength that Saddam Hussein has retained is now revealed as a renewed and genuine threat to the region.\nThe Iraqi tyrant continues to scheme against and deceive the rest of the world. The United Nations inspection commissions have, one after the other, uncovered his lies and discovered the hidden stocks of non-conventional weapons he sought to conceal. Saddam Hussein is attempting to keep the world in ignorance of his revived military power, but the world, under the determined leadership of the United States, is not turning a blind eye to the facts, and will not permit the tyranny of Saddam Hussein to survive.\nLast September, from this rostrum, I warned that Israel was about to become the target of attacks by Saddam Hussein in a war in which it was not involved, and to which it was not a party. And indeed Israel came under missile attack. It clenched its fists and gritted its teeth in refraining from any counter-attack, so as not to upset the international coalition. The international community has come to understand Israel's position as the bastion of genuine democracy in a dangerous and violent region. The events of the past year have made enlightened States world-wide re-evaluate the character of the Israeli-Arab conflict in the light of this correct political and historical perspective. Many countries realise today that the root causes of this bitter conflict, which has lasted decades, lie in the refusal of the Arab States - excluding Egypt - to recognise the existence of Israel and to accept its independence and sovereignty. It is this intransigence that has been the source of the wars imposed on Israel.\nIt has been clearly established that Israel is the only country in the world under a permanent tangible, physical threat to its very existence - a threat that has brought upon it six wars in the four decades of its existence. States that were themselves involved in the Gulf crisis have now come to understand, perhaps for the first time, the logic of Israel's insistence on a peace ensuring its security and the well-being of its inhabitants.\nIn January 1991 we presented a consolidated formula of five principles designed to promote the peace process: first, an end to the state of war between the Arab States and Israel, with a view to the signing of a peace treaty; secondly, reduction and control of the arms race; thirdly, direct negotiations, without preconditions, between Israel and its neighbours, with a view to the signing of peace agreements between Israel and each of the Arab States; fourthly, the simultaneous start of a resolution of the Palestinian problem, to be carried out in stages by us and the residents of Judea, Samaria and Gaza, in a joint framework with Jordan; and, fifthly, the drafting of joint programmes for regional development, with international aid, in areas such as water, the environment, electricity, solar energy, agriculture, health, transportation and the infrastructure. These principles have strengthened the foundations of the peace process in which we have been engaged since the cease-fire in the Gulf.\nSince its establishment Israel has tirelessly sought to talk peace with its neighbours. In the aftermath of each of the ware that was forced upon us Israel has appealed to the Arab States to conduct direct talks with it, with no prior conditions, to attain a true and lasting peace. It seems that this appeal will now at last be answered. In a few weeks we shall, I hope, meet in face-to-face discussions with our neighbours in order to lay the foundations of a better future for our peoples and our coming generations. Israel is convinced that the sufferings of our war-torn region will be brought to an end, not as a result of any balance of terror, but of the benefits that peace will bring.\nThe bitter arms race in the Gulf and the Middle East has brought many tragedies to the peoples of the region. It is responsible for the poverty and misery of millions of human beings and for the wars which have broken out in our region over and over again in the latter half of this century. The arms race has drained the resources of the different States to the detriment of the welfare of their citizens. The potential means of destruction amassed by cruel dictators with limitless ambitions is a proven recipe for the outbreak of wars.\nOur region has also known the use of chemical weapons, which Saddam Hussein used against his own people as well as against his Iranian enemy. The elimination of chemical weapons everywhere, and especially in the Middle East, is of supreme importance. This is why Israel has agreed to become a party to the convention to eliminate chemical weapons, while maintaining the principle of universality. For the convention to be effective all States of the region must become party to it.\nThe term \\\"weapons of mass destruction\\\" is no mere technical phrase. Every type of weapon - including conventional - that entails a threat of the indiscriminate destruction of large numbers of people falls, in our view, into the category of \\\"weapons of mass destruction\\\". Arms control must therefore include conventional weaponry as well.\nOn the eve of the convening of a regional peace conference, I appeal from this rostrum to the leaders of the Arab States. I say \\\"Stop the insane arms race in weapons of extermination. Abandon all destructive impulses. Put an end to blind hatred. Do not waste your resources. Do not give up the opportunity for progress and well-being for your own countries for the illusory dream of destroying Israel.\n\\\"Israel draws its strength from its historic and moral right to a safe existence in its own country. Set out with us on the path of peace. Think of your children, as we think of ours. For they were born not for war, to be killed, but to live.\\\"\nThe far-reaching changes that have occurred in the struggle between blocs in the world have also been accompanied by positive changes in Africa. Some internal wars have ended, and others we hope are about to end. The process of African States' attaining their independence has been completed. The apartheid regime in South Africa is nearing its end. A wind of democracy has blown through many African States, inspiring a progressive evolution.\nBut in many States of the third world, especially in Africa, hunger, disease and misery are still on the rise. The growing birth rate has led to a population explosion and has aggravated the shortage of essential foodstuffs. In extensive areas the desert has reclaimed arable land and pasture land. Hundreds of thousands of people are falling victim to starvation and epidemics. All this is happening at the end of the twentieth century, a century that has seen unprecedented scientific, technological and medical achievements. In an era in which borderlines between East and West are becoming blurred, the developed countries must seek to bridge the huge gaps between the living standards of the northern and southern hemispheres. We must lend an attentive ear, especially to the heart-rending appeals for help from the African continent.\nIsrael is a small country, poor in natural resources and material riches, but it has its faith. It faces the tremendous challenge of absorbing every year hundreds of thousands of new immigrants, who flock to it from many countries. \nHowever, in the process of building a new society and developing its economy, Israel has, over the past 40 years, accumulated considerable knowledge and experience in agriculture, technology, medicine and science, as well as in organisation and management. Israel has for many years placed its knowledge at the disposal of developing countries. The result of this mission which we have taken upon ourselves has been decades of cooperation and assistance to 96 countries.\nIn Israel, for several generations we have witnessed a revival in the life of a nation which has brought to the world values of peace, liberty and justice. These principles are the essence of the law of the Jewish people and of its universal message.\nThe Jewish people is the only people ever to have been exiled again and again, with its faith in its return to its homeland remaining unshaken. Bach time, mankind has benefited from the spiritual assets and values of justice which have accompanied the revival of the Jewish people in its ancestral land. The return to Zion in our own times, which has been the objective of the Zionist movement, has resulted in a gathering in Israel of the Jewish people from all over the world. Wherever tyranny has raged and our people have been persecuted, assistance came from Israel, bringing them back to their national homeland in freedom and security. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Israel took in hundreds of thousands of our brethren who had survived in Europe as well as hundreds of thousands from Arab countries and elsewhere, escaping discrimination and persecution.\nThese very days we are witnessing a phenomenon stirring in its enormity - that of the return of Jews from the Soviet Union and from Ethiopia to their ancestral homeland. The Zionist movement is colour-blind. The distinction between colours is alien to Zionism. That is why it has been proven that Zionism is tolerant and liberal par excellence.\nLast week, President Bush appealed to this Assembly to abrogate the cynical and deplorable resolution which equates Zionism with racism. The President aptly described the unique character of the Zionist movement and its spiritual and humanitarian values. More and more representatives of nations are joining his appeal, guided by this great historical truth. This appeal will continue to reverberate both within this Hall and outside it until the repeal, in the near future, of that resolution, which constitutes a calumny on this Organisation and a disgrace to it.\nThis session stands on the threshold of a new hope. People the world over aspire for an end to hardship and suffering and for the beginning, at last, of an era full of promise and hope. For us, the Jewish people, it is also the beginning of a new year, when we exchange the traditional blessing: \\\"May the outgoing year sweep away its maledictions, and may the new year bring with it blessings for all mankind.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi on his election to the most honoured position in our General Assembly - the presidency. At a crucial moment in our Organization's history, his election reflects the confidence that Member States have in his ability to lead us effectively in a session faced with many perplexing choices and difficulties.\nIt is my pleasure to take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea into the family of the United Nations. The membership of the two Koreas in the United Nations does not preclude their efforts for peaceful reunification. Indeed, we hope that the entry of the two Koreas into the United Nations will herald a further easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula.\nI am also pleased to welcome the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands as United Nations Members. As an island country, Singapore is happy to see more island countries becoming Members of the United Nations. I also welcome the entry into the United Nations of the three Baltic States - Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia - whose independence and sovereignty have now been recognised by the Soviet Union and many members of the international community, including Singapore.\nThis forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time of renewed faith in the United Nations and its role in the world. Treed from the constraints of the cold war, the United Nations responded with unprecedented speed to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The action in the Gulf became possible because the permanent members of the Security Council cooperated in a matter of peace and security in the way originally foreseen when the United Nations was founded. This fundamental objective of the United Nations was realised through the sustained cooperation and increased commonality of interests of the major Powers. The role of the United Nations in the Gulf war has given new hope to the smaller countries of the world like Singapore. He now have more confidence that this is a world in which nations can be secure because of the capacity of the United Nations to guarantee their security through collective measures. This is an important element in a new world order.\nThe United Nations emerged from the Gulf crisis strengthened and revitalized. Simultaneously with the changes in the world political order, it is being gradually transformed. In such a period of unprecedented changes in the world, the United Nations is well poised to play an increasingly significant role. Already, it can be congratulated on its role in resolving some long-standing regional conflicts, such as the Iran-Iraq War, the conflict concerning Namibia, and the civil wars in Angola and Cambodia.\nAs a South-East Asian country, Singapore is especially pleased to note the progress towards a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia. This was possible because of the outstanding support given by the international community since 1978; the perseverance of the two co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference on Cambodia - Indonesia and France; and the cooperation of the Permanent Five and regional and other states, as well as the United Nations Secretary-General and the Secretariat, Including Mr. Rafeeudln Ahmad and his staff. Singapore would also like to express its appreciation to the President of the International Conference on Kampuchaa, the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria, Mr. Alois Mock, and his distinguished predecessors. Ha also extend our thanks to the Ambassador of Senegal, Mrs. Absa Claude Diallo, and her predecessor for chairing the Ad Hoc Committee of the Conference.\nBut our particular appreciation and congratulations must be extended to His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the leaders of the other factions, who, through a series of compromises and cooperation at a number of recant meetings, have made possible a settlement consistent with the Permanent Five framework of August 1990 which will bring peace and national reconciliation to Cambodia. We welcome the presence of the Supreme National Council delegation led by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk at this session of the General Assembly. Singapore will cooperate fully with the United Nations and the Supreme National Council to help ensure that the Cambodian people will be able to exercise in free and fair elections its right of self-determination and to live in peace and harmony in an independent Cambodia. Thus, all of us have helped finally to achieve what the Association of South-East Asian Nations has been seeking to accomplish in Cambodia over the past 13 years.\nWe hope that the present atmosphere prevailing at the United Nations will also provide a window of opportunity to resolve the long-standing disputes and conflicts between the States and peoples of the Middle East. A durable and equitable peace settlement in the Middle Past can only be built on the basis of compromise and reconciliation. We call on both aides to display flexibility and moderation for the sake of peace and the welfare of their peoples. In this context, we welcome and support the efforts to convene a Middle East peace conference based on United Nations resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Singapore has always recognised both the right of Israel to live peacefully within secure and recognised borders and the right of the Palestinian people to their own homeland in the occupied territories.\nBut even as we look to the future with hope, the current political upheaval in the Soviet Union, one of the permanent members of the Security Council, gives us cause for concern. It is difficult to predict how its internal and external policies are going to evolve. Whatever the outcome of the crisis, it seems clear that the Soviet Union will probably be preoccupied with its internal problems for some time to come.\nWith the end of the cold war and the end of the confrontation between competing ideological blocs, it would be timely for the international community to strengthen its system for peace and security. Whenever international law and the principles of the Charter am violated, resolute action must be taken by the United Nations. The collective action taken by the United Nations to reverse the occupation of Kuwait was a unique case because the violation of basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity was so flagrant. It will probably be far more difficult to organize resistance to less clear-cut challenges. The question before the international community is how to make the United Nations wore affective in the post cold-war world.\nSingapore firmly ballades that the United Nations must have improved capabilities for anticipating and preventing conflicts. The United Nations needs a batter monitoring apparatus so that conflicts can be contained and resolved peacefully before hostilities begin. Also, while the Secretary-General is already authorised, under Article 99 of the Charter of the United Nations, to bring to the attention of the Security Council \\\"any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of International peace and security\\\", we agree with the view that the Secretary-General should be given a stronger position and the means to exercise authority. In addition, the possibility of strengthening the enforcement powers of the United Nations could be further explored.\nThe role of United Nations peace-keeping forces should also be expanded. They should not only deal with monitoring cease-fires and supervising the end of inter-State conflicts, but could also be used to ensure that conflicts are contained before they break out into open warfare. Singapore's support for United Nations peace-keeping operations has been demonstrated by the fact that we contributed military observers and police units to participate in United Nations peace-keeping missions in Namibia in 1969, at the Iraq-Kuwait border at the end of the Gulf War and in Angola earlier this year, and we will, we hope, do so in Western Sahara later this year.\nWe believe that a system of security must be built on principles of sovereignty and collective security, not on the military might of individual Powers, although the cold war has ended with some countries in a position of unparalleled political and economic Influence. Collective security arrangements by the United Nations, as defined in Chapter VII of the Charter, are, according to sceptics, neither collective nor secure if arranged and dominated by the big Powers, as they will shape the agenda and frame the targets.\nWhile being realistic about the leadership role of the big Powers, there is also a role for the smaller Member States. This would Include input, from the General Assembly on the implementation of United Nations collective-security procedures. In order to play this role responsibly, developing countries, which constitute a majority of General Assembly Members, should be rigorous in upholding standards of international conduct. They should be vigilant against transgressions of the principles of international law.\nAs we enter a new era of international relations, we feel that the United Nations itself needs to be improved to meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond. It is time to capitalise on the new spirit of cooperation at the United Nations and re-examine old priorities, the proliferation of agencies and the need for greater coordination among them. The United Nations could be revitalized by streamlining its structure and procedures. In order to inspire confidence and build consensus and support from the majority, the process of United Nations reforms should be transparent and democratic.\nIn the last forty years, during the cold war and its prevailing East-West tensions, the most difficult and urgent task before the United Nations was the maintenance of international peace and security. While this is still the main objective of the United Nations, we believe that in a changed international environment, the United Nations can make itself the major forum for promoting global economic and social development through greater self-help and North South cooperation.\nThe most formidable problem before the world community is the widening gulf between rich and poor countries. The peace of rich nations will not last long when the crisis of the global underclass assumes overwhelming proportions. There is no doubt that each country bears the main responsibility for its economic progress, but it is also the responsibility of both developed and developing countries to help poorer countries to help themselves. One means of such help is to provide technical assistance and manpower training in relevant fields of development. Very often it is the shortage of educated and trained manpower, together with rapid population expansion, which slows down economic growth and development in developing countries.\nThe developed countries can help the developing ones with effective population planning, improved primary health care and, above all, a reinforced and extended multilateral trading system and an open global economy to facilitate trade and investment flows to developing countries. There is now a greater need than ever for multilateral institutions and multilateral cooperation. The world of the 1990s bears little resemblance to the world of 1945, when the United Nations system was set up. Nation States, the basic units of the United Nations system, have less and less control over the external forces that are shaping the future. The United Nations system, for all its shortcomings, is the only available universal system. It has to rise up to the new challenges facing mankind if it is not to become irrelevant.\nApart from the gap between rich and poor, one of the major challenges facing the International community and one that requires a multilateral approach is the environment. The environment is our common heritage. Environmental degradation and the depletion of the ozone layer endanger all mankind. The United Nations is best placed to coordinate efforts and to tackle urgent environmental issues, which are complex, multifaceted and related to issues of development.\nThe other problem that requires a global approach is the drug problem. The drug trade can survive only if the forces of supply and demand are at work. The problem has to be tackled multilaterally, at the sources of production and in the countries that are the major markets for drug suppliers.\nThe global community has a stake in the success of the United Nations. Singapore will play its part in ensuring that the common aspirations of mankind, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter, are realised.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThree years ago I had the pleasure of describing to the Assembly, from this very rostrum, some of the refreshing and heart-warming scenes of the Seoul Olympic games. Athletes from around the world gave us an inspiring vision of global harmony, transcending the divisions of race, religion and ideology.\nSoon thereafter, revolutionary changes swept across the world. As we look around us today and take stock of those changes, we may truly recognize the progress made towards the Olympic ideal of \\\"one peaceful world\\\". Today I am proud to stand here once more, this time as President of a State Member of the United Nations. To me, this represents a significant expression of the new tide of history. It was 43 years ago that the Republic of Korea first applied formally to become a Member of the United Nations. Those who consider the decades of patience we have had to exercise will perhaps understand the enthusiasm displayed by the Korean people on this occasion.\nTo those who supported and encouraged our admission to this body and to those who acted and spoke on our behalf during all the years when we had no seat in this Assembly I offer the heartfelt gratitude of the 43 million Korean people.\nToday the cold-war system, which had prevented our entry into the United Nations, has become a relic of the past. From the workers of the Solidarity Movement in Gdansk, who raised the banner of reform in Poland, to the courageous Government in Budapest; from those freedom-inspired crowds who filled Prague's Vaclavske Plaza, to those former East Germans who tore down the Berlin Wall: they not only freed themselves, but opened the road towards genuine world peace. In removing the physical walls which denied them liberty, they also brought down the barriers which had divided mankind into hostile camps, inevitably resulting in confrontation and rivalry.\nIt was unquestionably the Soviet reforms that touched off these great changes. But the changes were also inspired by the achievements of those nations which attained prosperity on the strength of freedom and individual values. I share a deep sense of satisfaction over this outcome with those who have aspired to a truly harmonious world, and I pay a tribute to those whose courage made real what had been considered impossible in the past.\nSir, I offer my congratulations on your election as President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and express my confidence that this session under your leadership will produce fruitful and rewarding achievements. I regard it no less significant that, along with the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also become a Member of this Organisation. As our North Korean brothers join us in the journey towards peace and unification, I extend hearty congratulations to them on their entry into the Organization.\nThe Republic of Korea has long pursued parallel membership of both Koreas in the United Nations in the belief that it is the most realistic approach to the attainment of peace and unification on the Korean peninsula. Continuation of wasteful confrontation and of the refusal to recognise each other could only prolong the painful tragedy of national division. For this reason, the entry of both South Korea and North Korea into the United Nations marks an important turning-point in inter-Korean relations since the division of our land in 1945. As responsible members of the international community, the two Koreas are now both bound by the United Nations Charter to carry out the duties incumbent on all Members for the maintenance of world peace.\nNow that the representatives of South Korea and North Korea have taken their seats together in this hall of peace, we are convinced that a new chapter of reconciliation and cooperation will open on the Korean Peninsula.\nThe Korean people may live under separate systems, but we have never forgotten that we are one nation. Imperfect as it may be, the separate membership of the two Koreas in the United Nations is an important interim step on the road to national unification. It has taken more than 40 years for us to move the short distance from the seat of an observer to that of a Member. It took the two Germanys 17 years to combine their United Nations seats. I sincerely hope that it will not take as long for the two Korean seats to become one. In this hall of peace, the two Koreas will open a new avenue of dialogue and cooperation that will lead to our national unity.\nThe cold-war system that brought on the tragedy of territorial division in Korea has itself collapsed. Now we will seek to achieve national unification, peacefully, without the use of Military force, independently, on the basis of self-determination, and democratically, in accordance with the free will of the Korean people. I earnestly hope that all the Members of the United Nations will encourage and support Korean efforts to join the progress of mankind towards a more peaceful world by achieving national unity.\nThe world is undergoing epoch-making changes. Systems that oppressed freedom and human dignity are being dismantled and the tragedies stemming from dogmatic ideologies are coming to an end everywhere. Around the world nations are reeking to chart their own destinies. What is truly momentous about this process is that history is being advanced not by the forces of bloody revolution but by the power of reason and free spirit. But the great change has only just begun. This epic change brings enormous opportunities and is a source of hope for all mankind. Even so, we must travel a long and tortuous road before we can successfully mould the current process into a new order of world peace.\nThe recent Soviet political crisis is a clear demonstration of this fact. The entire world spent those three stressful days in a state of shock and dismay. However, the courageous citizens of Moscow braved the crisis and placed flowers in the muzzles of tank guns. Indeed, their victory is the victory of all freedom- and peace-loving peoples of the world. Once again the world has been reminded that indeed peace is indivisible.\nWe have to recognize that any attempt at reform, however minor, is bound to require an element of sacrifice and pain. In the cases of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries, we know they are currently engaged in thorough-going reforms of their political, economic and social foundations. As they move away from the system of strict control that pervaded every aspect of their lives for decades, the difficulties and costs of creating new structures roust be truly enormous. \nWe all know that throughout the cold-war period, the nations of the world spent an exorbitant amount of resources on national security and military preparedness. Now the success of current reforms promises to bring benefits the world over in the form of peace, and we will enjoy this peace dividend for a long time to come. \nAs the benefits of peace are shared, it is only fair that the burdens and sacrifices should also be shared. Consequently, I call upon all the well-to-do nations to extend active support and assistance to the countries which used to have centrally planned economic systems, in their transition to democracy and free market economies. Owing to the imperatives of the cold war, the Korean people have had to sustain enormous sacrifices throughout the post-war period. Accordingly we, perhaps more than any nation on earth, yearn for a world of peace. \nAs a nation that rose only a generation ago from the ashes of war and as a recently democratized nation that is growing in prosperity, the Republic of Korea feels a special affinity with the emerging democracies and understands from experience the acute requirement that these nations are facing in common - namely, the achievement of democratic and economic development in tandem. Korea is neither a wealthy nor an advanced country. But we are prepared to extend support to the reform efforts not only in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, but in all parts of the world, and to offer them cooperation to the best of our ability. \nIn my speech to the General Assembly at its forty-third session, I declared that a durable peace would arrive in our world the day we beat swords into ploughshares on the Korean peninsula. I said this because our own land was visited by untold trials and tribulations arising from the international imperatives of the twentieth century, and because the yoke was still upon us. However, the climate surrounding the Korean peninsula has undergone significant changes over the past years. Even before the onset of world-wide reform movements, we took the initiative of going beyond the limits of the cold war. Subsequently, we established diplomatic relations with the central and eastern European countries as well as with the Soviet Union. We also opened mutual exchanges and cooperative relations with neighbouring China. \nFor the previous half century, Korea's relations with these countries had been officially severed, and in practice were often confrontational. However, with our new friendships and cooperation we sense the onrush of the waves of contemporary history. Indeed, we have discovered the power of reconciliation. We are firmly convinced that the day of peace and unification is also coming to our land, in spite of territorial division and the ever-present military threat. \nWith the entry of the two Koreas to the United Nations, we have embarked on a new phase of coexistence. Now, it is our task to build on this foundation a positive relationship, which will soon bring peace, stability and national unity. To this end, I propose that the two Korean Governments agree on, and specifically carry out, the following three measures.\nFirst, the two Koreas should replace the fragile armistice with a permanent peace structure. Even at this very moment, a total of 1.7 million heavily armed soldiers confront each other on the Korean Peninsula,  concentrated along the 250-kilometre-long demilitarised zone. It might come as a surprise to some of you, but we have been living under this unstable condition of neither peace nor war for the last four decades. In the light of these precarious realities, I believe the two Koreas should conclude a peace agreement, thus renouncing the use of force against each other, and should proceed to normalise bilateral relations in all areas.\nMy second proposal is that, in order to reduce the threat of war on the Korean peninsula, the two sides should seek to bring about realistic arms reductions, beginning with measures designed to build mutual confidence. In order to remove military confrontation from the Korean peninsula, it is imperative that South and North Korea agree upon a number of military confidence-building measures, including the exchange of military information, the advance notification of field exercises and of troop movements, and the exchange of permanent observer teams to prevent surprise attacks.\nAbove all, the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula will present a threat not only to the peace of North-East Asia but also to the peace of the whole world. Atomic energy must never be used for destructive military purposes; it must be used only for the peaceful purposes of promoting the well-being of all mankind.\nSince the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it should immediately abandon the development of nuclear weapons and submit, unconditionally, all its nuclear-related materials and facilities to international inspection. Once the Democratic People's Republic of Korea abandons its development of nuclear weapons, and as confidence-building measures are implemented between South and North Korea, I am prepared to take up discussions with North Korea\nnot only on the reduction of conventional forces but also on the nuclear issues on the Korean peninsula.\nFinally, and on a more humanitarian plane, the two Koreas should bring an end to the period of disassociation, and open a new era of free exchange of products, information and people. On our peninsula today, there are over 10 million Koreans who live separated from their families and loved ones as a result of the territorial division in 1945. They are denied even the most basic humanitarian right of knowing whether or not their parents, brothers and sisters are still alive, let alone exchanging letters or telephone calls.\nI do not believe we can talk meaningfully about improving inter-Korean relations or about mutual confidence-building without first resolving this urgent humanitarian problem. Just as it is a universal practice among all civilised nations, so must the two Koreas open doors towards each other and guarantee free travel, communication and trade.\nWe must promote substantive relations by resolving, through dialogue and negotiations, issues of mutual interest, including inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation as well as political and military issues.\nNext month, for the first time since the two Koreas became Members of this Organization, the two Government delegations will meet for a fourth round of north-south high-level talks. I sincerely hope that the talks will produce an agreement on the basic principles governing inter-Korean relations.\nRecently, some limited exchanges between the two Koreas have taken place in such areas as sports, culture and trade. Small as they are, we value this progress. For our part, we will do our best to promote a relationship of common prosperity in which the two Koreas offer each other assistance for mutual development. The Republic of Korea is prepared to actively pursue\neconomic cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in all areas, including trade, tourism, joint exploration of underground resources, and establishment of joint-venture plants.\nPlease bear in mind that the Korean people have been living as a single national community for over 1300 years. Therefore, once exchanges and cooperation begin, conditions for a political integration of the two parts of Korea will ripen very quickly, given our historical homogeneity. I do not believe that the Korean peninsula should be left as the only land remaining divided by the cold war. At a time when all the divisive barriers are collapsing, the unification of the Korean peninsula must be a matter of time and of the natural course of history. A unified Korea will be a land of freedom and happiness for all inhabitants, and will become a nation devoted to the promotion of world peace and the well-being of all mankind.\nThe Korean people desire to see peace prevail not only on the Korean peninsula but in all regions of dispute as well. I am gratified to note that there are real signs of progress in peace-making efforts in many areas of the world, including the Middle East, Cambodia? Angola, Western Sahara and Central America. I am highly encouraged to see the United Nations playing leading roles in these areas, and I wish to pay my respects to the Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his devoted efforts.\nAlong with efforts to prevent regional disputes and to remove their root causes, we should strengthen the enforcement of collective security measures. The recent war in the Gulf region confirmed that the United Nations is the only independent global body capable of asserting and giving force to the rule of law in today's international community. Our faith that peace and justice will prevail throughout the world under a new international order was bolstered when countries put aside their differences and joined the United Nations action in a coalition.\nMembers of this body will of course recall that the Republic of Korea was able to survive and preserve its integrity thanks to the very first collective security action on the part of the United Nations. Now, as a Member, we will participate more actively in all United Nations endeavours towards the peaceful settlement of disputes as well as in the enforcement of international justice. Peace can be built only when a common conviction prevails that nations do not threaten each other and that we may in fact live in tranquillity. He shall never win faith in peace so long as we let our safety hinge on the might of formidable weapons that can reduce this world to ashes in an instant.\nConfrontations that brought about the balance of terror have now disappeared. We welcome the signing in July of the START treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. We hope that it will accelerate arms control negotiations around the world.\nThe Republic of Korea fully supports a complete elimination of all chemical weapons and will readily join an international convention as soon as it emerges. In this connection, I believe that the countries of North-East Asia should now take a fresh look at and approaches towards the questions of tension reduction and arms control in this region.\nIt is said that peace is more than the absence of war. To ensure real and lasting peace, we must remove the underlying sources of conflict. Just as the world is passing beyond ideological divisiveness, we must remove all barriers of discrimination - race, colour, religion and national origin. I therefore welcome the positive efforts in South Africa to build a united, democratic and discrimination-free society.\nThe Independent Commission on International Development Issues concluded in its final report that where poverty reigns there can be no peace. Because the Korean people have had similar experiences, we feel compassion towards the poverty-stricken countries and have a deep understanding of the problems they are facing at present: poverty, hunger, underdevelopment and foreign debt. Since the Republic of Korea made the transition from underdeveloped to newly industrialising country within the span of one generation, we may have become a model for those developing countries, with the message that they, too, can succeed given time and national resolve.\nThirty years ago, my country was a poor agrarian society with a per capita gross national product of under $100. Today, Korea has become a country with the thirteenth largest trade volume and fifteenth largest gross national product in the world. Korea's rapid development is due largely to the advantages of free market economics and the openness of democratic societies.\nThe vast global market served as the seedbed of development for an Industrious people and innovative businesses. The Korean people have continued their efforts towards further progress. Many countries around the world, as well as the United Nations itself, provided assistance in the process of Korea's development and became our partners for common prosperity.\nToday, the Republic of Korea lies at the midway stage between the advanced and the developing countries. As such, we hope to repay the benefits we received from around the world by playing an active role in solving the global North-South problem. In addition to sharing our experience and expertise with the developing countries, we will seek to play the role of a bridge between the advanced and the developing world by promoting global exchanges and cooperation and by facilitating the flow of commodities, capital and information.\nThe advanced countries should actively extend assistance to the developing countries with a view to mitigating the letter's difficulties. These measures by themselves cannot fundamentally solve the North-South problem, and we therefore encourage the advanced countries to move forward with the horizontal specialisation of industries among nations by accelerating the readjustment of their domestic industrial structures. In addition, they should also refrain from monopolizing information and technology.\nIn order to assist the economic growth of the developing countries, global markets should be opened wider and the expansion of trade should be encouraged. Tendencies towards protectionism and mutually exclusive regional economic blocs should be discouraged. The international community should adopt a more positive posture towards the solution of these critical problems within the framework of the United Nations system. Also, we should jointly tackle such new and serious global challenges as drug trafficking, terrorism and environmental damage.\nA new century is almost upon us. The twentieth century has seen a great number of achievements, certainly far more than in previous millennia. At the same time, however, this century has also been a period of unspeakable trials and tribulations brought on by wars, confrontations, inequities, and irrationality. With the twenty-first century near at hand, the human race is embarking on a new era of peace and reason. The irresistible waves of history today are those propelled by freedom, democracy and respect for human dignity and individual values.\nA new era is upon us in which mutual respect prevails among nations and conflicts are resolved by peaceful means. Revolutionary advances in science and technology, particularly in the fields of transportation, information and communication, have transformed the world into a global village in which human beings can pursue common prosperity as neighbours.\nSince the dawn of history, the human race has aspired to create a peaceful community on this turbulent planet. That aspiration is no longer a dream but a realistic goal. As partners for peace and common prosperity, all nations on Earth should now open their societies and broaden the avenues of exchange and cooperation to build this peaceful community. As the pivotal Organisation for world peace, the United Nations, I believe, is fully capable of fulfilling this historic task by faithfully carrying out the letter and spirit of the Charter.\nAs a full-fledged Member of this world body, the Republic of Korea now proudly joins the world of nations in our common task of realizing the long-held dreams of all mankind. We may ask for help and understanding with our own problems, but we also care deeply for the welfare of other peoples.\nWe renew our commitment to the United Nations and we shall march forward hand in band with all nations in the cause of this Organisation. Henceforth, the Republic of Korea will play a leading role in building a world that will be a blessing to our posterity - a world that will be freer, safer and happier; above all, a world of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the people and the Government of Honduras, I should like to express to the President our congratulations on his election to stewardship over the work of the current session of the General Assembly. The international community, in entrusting so delicate a set of responsibilities to him, has paid a well-deserved tribute to his personal merits as well as to Saudi Arabia, which only a few months ago successfully defended its threatened sovereignty.\nI should like to place on record the appreciation of the Government of Honduras for the direct, effective and unceasing work done by the Secretary-General, Javier Peres de Cuellar, in carrying out his highly responsible tasks. I should also like to congratulate the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania on their admission to membership of the United Nations. Their participation will undoubtedly contribute to the renewal of criteria and mechanisms, thus furthering the full realisation of the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter.\nIn welcoming the Baltic States, we can do no less than express our satisfaction at witnessing an act of historic reparation of great significance to the active reality of an international order based on law and justice. Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were absorbed by the Soviet Union by an act of force during the turmoil of the Second World War. Their forcible annexation was something which, sooner or later, had to be subjected to the sole proof of legitimacy the modern world knows: self-determination for its peoples, freely expressed under clear and objective rules and guarantees.\nThis is indeed what did take place throughout 1990 and 1991 and these fundamental facts, this exercise of fundamental rights, are indeed what the central authorities of the Soviet Union and the international community have recognised. It is the right approach, and it is the approach which our Organization should not only encourage, but rather resolutely promote by all the political, legal and economic means at its disposal. The admission of the Republic of Korea is also an act of justice; as the Korean people has offered continual proof of its adherence to the democratic ideal, and as this friendly, peace-loving nation, despite the vicissitudes to which its geopolitical situation has subjected it in the strategic confrontation between the great Powers, has managed to move forwards with evident prosperity and its own identity, which fully justify its incorporation as a new Member of the United Nations.\nWe are sure that the simultaneous admission of the two Korean States will be grounds for optimism for the dialogue on reunification and peaceful coexistence that the authorities of the two States are conducting and for a peaceful solution to the disputes separating them.\nThe transformation in the world scene is taking place because of a radical change in political perceptions. This new vision has led, as a consequence, to concepts which are linked not only with the internal economic production systems of States and the representativity of their Governments but also with national autonomy and identity, which help to forge a new and just geopolitical system. All this has paved the way for an unprecedented advance in the world-wide consolidation of democracy.\nThe recent events in the Soviet Union are further proof of these trends. My Government places on record its support for, and satisfaction at, the display of commitment to the ideals of democratic change by the Russian people and reaffirms its full readiness to develop greater ties of cooperation with the Soviet Union and with the sovereign States of the Union.\nThe United Nations, because of its universal nature, has taken the lead in seeking to keep the development of these political phenomena within the framework of the aims and principles set out in its Charter. When far-reaching questions arise within various Member States of our Organisation about the new destinies their peoples wish to forge, and when bilateral and regional relations go through acute crises in the quest for a new order based on justice and equity, the United Stations Charter gives us the lasting principles which afford us the right solutions to the difficulties which arise.\nThis is the best moment for us to support the Secretary-General in his initiative to enable the United nations to practice real preventive diplomacy as an active part in forming and maintaining the new international order.\nAlso, my Government would like to express its gratitude for the role the United Nations is playing through its peace-keeping missions. The operations the Organisations has carried out in this field have led to a reduction in tensions and are helping to establish the necessary climate of confidence to master the sensitive situations which periodically occur in various regions.\nThe Government of Honduras is participating in the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, which is supervising the organization of the referendum to be held in the Western Sahara. The confrontation that has occurred in that territory must thus give way, with the help of the United Nations, to a political solution in which the will of the people is expressed by a vote under international supervision.\nIn the context of current international problems, the series of conflicts subsumed under the heading \\\"Middle East\\\" has over time come to be seen not only as extremely delicate but sometimes as almost impassable to resolve. In our judgement, the emotional burden created by various persecutions, wars, territorial conflicts and strategic considerations in a bipolar world used to contribute, among other factors, to frustrating initiatives aimed at rapprochement and any realistic search for lasting peace in that region. Today, by contrast, the Middle East is also seeing emerge the outlines of solutions under the auspices of this Organization. The convening of a conference with wide-ranging participation - aimed at helping both the Israeli and the Arab sides involved tackle existing disputes - is gaining increasing acceptance as the best and most integral way of achieving peace and reconciliation in that region.\nMeanwhile, in South Africa, new political steps have brought about the formal dismantling of the apartheid laws. This is a positive development that must be seen through to effective completion via practical measures that have real impact on the vast majority of the population. Above all, there must be a deepening of the dialogue between the Government and the African National Congress with a view to ensuring an orderly transition to a society of greater justice and shared prosperity.\nIn Central America, the United Nations contribution to peace has been timely and invaluable. The socio-political problems faced by certain countries, together with tensions between States that reflect the East-West conflict in the area, triggered an acute crisis in the 1980s that posed a real threat to regional and international peace and security. In that context, Honduras promoted from the outset greater and effective participation by third countries and the United Rations towards a solution to the Central American crisis.\nIn 1991, because of firm abidance by commitments made by the Presidents of the five countries of the Esquipulas process, and through the establishment (f democracy in all the Central Americas countries, it can be said that the phase of confrontation has given way to understanding and cooperation.\nThe Government of Honduras resolutely supports progress made in that context last week and yesterday within the framework of the dialogue for peace, justice and democracy in El Salvador. We are firmly committed to the idea that the accords that have been negotiated between the Government headed by President Cristiani and the Frente Farabundo Marti should be consolidated. We hope there will soon be a cease-fire and that the reconciliation for which the Salvadorian family strives will be fully achieved, so that within that neighbouring nation a democratic and tolerant society will take root, thus expressing the dedication and hard work of the Salvadorian people.\nTowards that end, the presence in Central America of the United Rations continues to be necessary. The work of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (OKUSAL) is crucial to ensure compliance with the accords worked out between the Government and the Frente Farabundo Marti in connection with human rights and a future verification of the cease-fire. Moreover, my Government maintains that we must keep United Nations observers in certain border areas between El Salvador and Honduras. That is why, along with the other Central American Governments, we would like to request the extension for another six months of the mandate of the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ONUCA). The United Nations participation is thus not confined merely to monitoring compliance with certain commitments which the Central American Governments assumed via the Esquipulas IT accords; it also involves the adoption of approaches to resolve El Salvador's domestic problems, a contribution which the Government of Honduras supports.\nIn the specific field of Central American security, the Security Commission that has been meeting, with United Nations participation on an observer basis, has not made the progress my Government had hoped for. Because of the persistence of armed conflict, there has been a delay in handing over an inventory of installations and armaments on the part of the military and security forces in each country. In Honduras' case, such an inventory was submitted on 6 June to the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as to the Secretary-General of the Organisation of American States. Beyond that, we must study and adopt machinery that will ensure a military balance among the States of the region.\nIn this context, my Government has taken the initiative to propose to our Central American neighbours a comprehensive draft regional security treaty, a document that was taken note of by the Central American Presidents at the tenth regional summit conference held from 15 to 17 July this year. It has been the subject of negotiation since then with a view to the adoption, before the end of this year, of a pertinent instrument on the subject. The task of bringing peace to Central America will never be complete if the leaders and their peoples do not manage to meet and master the major challenges facing us as we seek to achieve sustained economic development in the context of societies in which social justice, liberty, democracy and development will be indestructible pillars of independence and sovereignty.\nThe President of Honduras, Rafael Leonardo Callejss, together with the Presidents of the other five Central American countries, has therefore been promoting economic integration in Central America to the greatest possible extent. Effective steps have been taken to ensure that, within an appropriate institutional framework and with the support of the international community, as well as the active involvement of entrepreneurs and workers as economic protagonists, we might arrive relatively soon at a standardization and progressive reduction of tariffs vis-\u00e0-vis the outside world. He also seek to establish intensive programmes of industrial conversion and an accelerated liberalization of intra-Central American trade involving industrial and agricultural products, along with a progressive integration of financial services.\nThe economic structural adjustments to which we are committed make genuine international solidarity more necessary than ever before. Should patterns of economic behaviour based on statistics alone continue to emerge, each country and the international community as a whole will face an era of greater distrust and despair. Economic discipline, in this global contact, must be diversified and corrected through programme of social cooperation, and there must be a fast method of disbursing official loans, along with greater participation In developing countries by the financial and entrepreneurial sectors of the industrialised world. South-South cooperation must also be channelled towards more practical goals. Better means must be devised to allow us to share our experience better and use our respective competitive advantages to the best effect.\nGenerally speaking, my Government hopes to see a constructive dialogue between North and South that would lead us towards an all-encompassing strategy based upon consensus which would guarantee real progress towards the attainment of the goals we have sat for our countries by the year 2000.\nConsistent with these aspirations and these responsibilities, the Government of Honduras is organising a Central American presidential summit meeting, to be held in my country next December, focusing on social matters and questions relating to children. He are convinced that at that time we shall be able to work out a strategy for human development in Central America which, besides involving a commitment to dealing with the traditional problems of poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy, school abandonment and unemployment, will come to grips with the deterioration of people's living conditions through the effects of drugs and the degradation of the environment.\nIn Honduras we have established a broad-ranging programme aimed at achieving social equity, including programmes to assist mothers who are heads of families, a social fund for housing, a large-scale programme for construction of classrooms with the appropriate furniture, and also the Honduran Social Investment Fund. The last-named institution has in recent \nmonths succeeded in resolving enormous problems facing communities and municipalities in Honduras with the use of local labour and technical advice from our own national experts. It enjoys an excellent reputation internationally, which makes it easier for it to gain access to resources from abroad for its human development projects.\nWe are also keenly aware of the support that must be given to the forthcoming Earth Summit, as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro from 1 to 12 June 1992, has been called. He are aware of the close relationship between economic development and the environment and consequently we are taking an active part in defining the basic principles that are to govern the economic and ecological behaviour of peoples and nations for ensuring a common future.\nWe realise that we developing countries must not make the same mistakes as the developed countries have made as regards the negative impact productive activity has had upon the environment. However, the progress and further development of the industrialized countries must not be pursued at the expense of the well-being and flourishing of our peoples. It is here that the concept of shared responsibility and international solidarity finds its first application.\nAs regards the regional agenda, Honduras, with its neighbours in Central America, is striving to improve the environment, by means of reforestation and protection of tropical forests, and also through a number of other measures, particularly in those areas where refugees and those displaced by the crisis of the 1980s were settled and where there have been difficulties in regard to the preservation of the environment. My Government has also assumed its responsibility for the preservation of the biosphere of the Platano River, in\nnorthern Honduras, a heritage of mankind, according to a resolution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, and the second most important reservoir of natural oxygen in Latin America after the Amazon region, according to a statement of the United Nations Environment Programme.\nAs we approach the end of this century, our Organisation will be marking its fiftieth anniversary. In view of the trends of population growth in a world where natural resources are becoming more and scarcer and where technology, although it increases productivity, can also seriously harm the environment, we must stay alert. It must be understood that cooperation and solidarity between the developed North and the developing South must he the framework for our efforts for the new millennium. Let the commitment to renewed cooperation and solidarity be one of the fundamental guidelines for the United Nations for the decade now beginning. Let us endeavour thus to make possible the attainment of the noble goals set forth in the Charter of our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe election of Ambassador Samir Shihabi to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session does honour to his diplomatic talents and his experience in this Organisation. It is also eloquent testimony to the distinguished role and place of honour occupied by his country, Saudi Arabia, within the framework of the new facts of world geopolitics. I can assure him that he can count on the full cooperation of our delegation towards the success of his task.\nHis predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Justice of Malta, conducted the proceedings of the forty-fifth session in a remarkable manner. My delegation therefore associates itself with the words of praise that have been addressed to him by previous speakers.\nSince 1982 the Secretary-General's reports on the work of the Organization have not been just an analysis of the international situation but also and above all a series of varied proposals designed to enhance the authority and prestige of the United Nations. Today the renaissance of the United Nations is doubtless the result of a fundamental change in attitude and outlook on the part of States, but it is also and above all the result of so many years of effort by the Secretary-General that has made it possible for our Organization to adapt itself wisely to the needs of the current international situation. We therefore must pay a particular tribute to him for the devotion, diplomatic ingenuity and determination he has always shown in carrying out his delicate task of promoting peace and harmony among peoples.\nI could not conclude this brief introduction without expressing the great satisfaction of Cove d'lvoire at seeing the world Organization moving more and more in the direction of universality, with the admission of the new Members: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I extend to them our warmest congratulations and assure them of our complete readiness to cooperate with them within the framework of our Organization and to maintain relationships of honest cooperation with them.\nCote d'lvoire has always placed the quest for peace among its highest priorities. It has had the honour of serving for a second time in the Security Council, and at a special moment in the history of international relations. During the recent events, the Security Council eloquently demonstrated that, over and above theoretical debates, it was well able to redress critical situations where there had been a breach of the peace or act of aggression. It is solely the logic of peace that has guided us in the positions we have taken on the questions before the Council. We have always preferred responsible language to an excess of verbiage in the Council and a pragmatic and tolerant approach towards the problems, no matter how grave and distressing, that have come before that body.\nWe have not been able to remain passive when friendly countries have become the victims of unjust aggression, and we have always placed the triumph of right above the mere reconciliation of conflicting interests. We shall therefore leave the Security Council at the end of this year with the profound conviction of having worked in that organ with all our energy, in the service of peace, and of leaving behind us an image of Cote d'lvoire of respect for others and of fraternal love. We should like to thank the friendly countries which supported our candidacy at the time of our election to the Security Counci1.\nThe current developments in international relations, characterised by the acceleration and wide scope of political and social changes in various parts of the world, have made it clearer with each passing day that we are gradually entering a new era. Indeed, today the cold war is just history and the whole architecture of international relations that developed out of it is now doomed to obsolescence. Henceforth the conduct of foreign affairs will be guided by the powerful factor of cooperation and understanding between the States whose convergence of views and actions has made possible, among other things, the spectacular strengthening of the United Nations in its role as keeper of the peace. In its turn, the climate of confidence thus created has made possible meetings between the leaders of those States. It is on the basis of that confidence that the United States and the Soviet Union have been able to embark on negotiations with a view to concluding various agreements. Both sides have been able to undertake substantial reductions of their arms stockpiles. For example, those spectres of death - the B-52 super-bombers armed with several hundred nuclear warheads - have just been taken off their state of permanent nuclear alert; long- and short-range missiles are beginning to be disarmed; and some nuclear programmes have been abandoned.\nThe most cherished hope of mankind, the hope for a world of peace without a nuclear threat, has finally been able to take root. Furthermore, the unilateral disarmament which was proclaimed last week without any preliminary negotiation and without any long and arduous dealings where mistrust and suspicion reign, illuminates the state of mind now prevailing in this area. This so-called policy of \\\"example\\\" heralds, if the challenge is accepted by the USSR, a new dawn in the field of disarmament. We are now entitled to think that there now exists a definite dynamic for peace which would promote the peaceful settlement of conflicts and reduce sources of tension.\nThat is the case in Angola where we are happy to see taking shape on the horizon a settlement of an internal conflict between the MPLA and UNITA that has lasted for 16 years. The cease-fire in force since the signing in Estoril of the agreement which put an end to hostilities, and the holding of elections in the next few months are all chances for a final settlement of this conflict which has caused so much destruction of property and has taken such a toll of human life.\nFor its part the Government of my country can only welcome the signing of such an agreement for which it spared no effort in order to prevail upon the parties to overcome their ideological differences. With the return of peace, which we hope to be imminent, the people of Angola will finally be able to begin the only struggle worth their efforts, namely, that of the economic and social development of their country.\nWith regard to the situation in the Western Sahara, the solution to this thorny problem has never seemed so close. Indeed, the cease-fire which was brought about a few weeks ago between the parties to the conflict, creates conditions for the application of the United Nations peace plan which provides, inter alia, for the holding of a referendum. The opportunity will thus be given to the Sahraoui people to take a clear stand on their future. That is why we solemnly and urgently appeal to the various parties to respect the commitments undertaken within the framework of that plan.\nThe changes which have occurred throughout the world have also had positive repercussions on the development of the internal situation in South Africa. The courageous reforms undertaken by President de Klerk in dismantling the odious system of apartheid have made it possible to embark upon honest cooperation among the different parties in South Africa. It is worth recalling that since 28 April 1971 President Houphouet-Boigny has been advocating the idea of dialogue with South Africa, which alone can promote the development of the internal political situation of that country.\nIt is both a welcome fact and a major historical event that the first Felix Houphouet-Boigny prize for peace created at the twenty-fifth session of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was awarded by an international jury to Nelson Mandela and de Klerk. We thus appeal urgently to all the protagonists in South Africa to rise to the occasion and to promote as soon as possible the advent of a multiracial, egalitarian, democratic South Africa.\nThe analysis of the Middle East situation suggests that, particularly in this part of the world, the climate of confidence and understanding which has been established in international relations could have the most favourable repercussions on a solution to the conflict which has rent this part of the world for so long. While it is true that the situation remains very alarming, the fact still remains that chances of a just and lasting solution to this conflict seem better than ever before. \nIndeed, the many initiatives currently under way and aimed at promoting negotiations between the various parties, could lead, we believe, to the holding of an international conference on peace in the Middle East. For its part, Cote d'lvoire would encourage the holding of such a conference to examine the situation overall. It is our wish to see that conference making an effective contribution to a global, just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem.\nWithin the same context we very much hope to see the strengthening of peace in Lebanon so that the sons of that country, battered by 15 years of fratricidal war, can finally in union and concord begin the task of national reconstruction so as to make Lebanon its old vibrant self once again.\nIn Asia too the dynamic of detente has been witnessed. After the more than two decades of fratricidal war that has battered Cambodia we finally note with relief definite signs of a forthcoming settlement of the Cambodian tragedy within the framework of the United Nations.\nWe would like to welcome here the concerted action of the permanent members of the Security Council and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which for so many years have spared no effort to restore peace to that country.\nWith your permission, Sir, I should like to revert to Africa, more particularly to Liberia, a neighbour of the Cote d'lvoire where for almost two years now a fratricidal conflict has been going on with its toll of material damage and the destruction of human life and which also has caused many refugees to flee to neighbouring countries. In Cote d'lvoire alone there are about 320,000 and the Government and people of our country, with the aid of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, have been trying to give them assistance and support pending their return home.\nHowever, one of the prerequisites for such a return is the restoration of peace and security in Liberia. Since that time all the Heads of State and Government of the countries of the West African subregion within the framework of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have been working to that end. Several meetings for peace in Liberia have been held under aegis of that organization, particularly through the Standing Mediation Committee and also the Ad Hoc Committee of Five, of which Cote d'lvoire has the honour to be the President.\nThe initiatives undertaken within the framework of the work of these two Committees, whose actions are complementary, led to the signing on 17 September 1991 at Yamoussokro of a communiqu\u00e9 whereby the parties reaffirmed their commitment to continue to observe and to strengthen the cease-fire in Liberia. They decided, under the supervision of the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to confine troops to zones to be determined and to disarm them. The parties have also decided to set up an electoral commission of five members with a view to organizing and supervising elections in Liberia. They have also agreed to cooperate fully with the \\\"International Negotiations Network (INN)\\\" of the Carter Centre, designed to provide assistance to the organizing of the electoral process.\nWe hope that the promising process thus begun will be further and more positively developed in the course of the forthcoming meeting in Yamoussokro on 29 October 1991.\nIf in political terms the climate of confidence and concord which has been established in the international community has made it possible to solve certain conflicts and open the way to the solution of those which still exist, the same does not apply to international economic relations. Indeed, the current situation of the international economy is marked by the appearance of signs of a slow-down more or less everywhere in the world, which constitutes a source of major concern for all the partners of the international community and, particularly, for the developing countries.\nThe reasons for concern on the part of the developing countries are real and serious and deserve attention. Indeed, the allow-down in economic activity in the industrialised countries, reflected by a real rate of growth of the gross domestic product, which is less than 2 per cent in 1991, would have as a consequence among other things a significant decline in growth of domestic global demand and a decline in investment rates. This situation of recession in the developed countries means for us in the developing countries: a quantitative decline in our exports of agricultural, mining and mineral primary commodities; an even steeper decline in prices for those primary commodities; and also a decline in our export earnings, which constitute the bulk of our financial resources. That is where our apprehensions lie. As to the problem of the external debt of developing countries, the international context remains unfavourable.\nIt is precisely because of the size of the economic problems faced by Africa that the international community recognized the urgency of examining in 1986 at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations the critical economic situation in Africa, which gave rise to the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990, more commonly known as UNPAAERD. Today, as we take stock, we are unfortunately obliged to recognise the grim facts. The United Nations Programme of Action has not lived up to its promises, for it has done little to improve the results of the African economies. In this connection my delegation fully endorses the analysis contained in the memorandum submitted by the African ministers responsible for economic development and planning to the Ad Hoc Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with examining and evaluating the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990.\nThe unsatisfactory results of that Programme will at least have enabled us to establish once and for all the fact that the question of African economic development cannot be properly dealt with without a radical solution to the continent's external debt problem. Without underestimating the importance and genuine merits of various measures and proposals designed to alleviate the debt burden of developing countries, we must nevertheless admit - and this is the position of Cote d'lvoire - that with regard to the political situation of the African countries the problem of debt cannot be separated from that of the price of primary commodities, whether agricultural, mining or mineral products.\nThere can be no radical solution to the problem of our external debt, while the prices of our primary commodities remain low. Cote d'lvoire is of the opinion that the law of supply and demand is justified in relations among countries with the same level of development, but not in relations between developed and developing countries. There can be no liberty without equality. However, between developing and developed countries there is an enormous gap. No one can maintain that liberalism exists when one side alone fixes the prices for imported raw materials, the prices for exported manufactured products, freight rates and transport and sets the conditions of transfer of the technology required for the industrialisation of the developing countries.\nToday, the low prices of primary commodities, whether agricultural, mining or mineral, are justified in economic analyses by the conventional notion of overproduction on the international market. It is our experience that there is no overproduction, but rather, that there is under-consumption owing to the high prices of finished and semi-finished products, which increases the profit margins of businesses and other middle-men.\nThe fundamental difference between developed and developing countries is that the former possess the necessary technology to transform our insufficiently priced primary commodities into finished products for their domestic consumption and export, whereas we, who lack that capability, are forced to export our primary commodities in a raw state, with all the disadvantages that that entails.\nIt would be desirable in the next few years to try to bring about an effective transfer of technology to developing countries so that the producers of primary commodities can transform a part of their production domestically, and, above all, can absorb their unemployed by creating new jobs and achieving an over-all improvement in their standard of living through an increase in household income and public funds.\nThe economy of Cote d'lvoire is subject to exterior pressures created by a combination of high foreign debt and continued low prices for primary export commodities, which result in a persistent need for continued large-scale financing. Thus, on 28 May 1990 the National Assembly of Cote d'lvoire approved a programme of stabilization and economic recovery, which the Government has adopted and implemented. The programme has two elements.\nThe first concerns short-term financial stability to reduce and gradually eliminate the State deficit and improve the country's economic and financial environment. The second entails structural reforms aimed over the mid-term at restoring the productivity and competitiveness of the national production apparatus in order to restore the bases for economic recovery in keeping with the country's potential. The improvement of the investment climate through appropriate legislative measures as well as the deregulation of the modalities for financing economic activity are also part of this element.\nIn this connection the International Monetary Fund credit line of $113 million adopted on 20 September 1991 to bolster economic reform in Cote d'lvoire, as well as the $150 million loan granted on 1 October by the World Bank and designed to support the adjustment programme of Cote d'lvoire's financial sector, are both encouraging signs for the success of the new structural reforms undertaken by our country's Government.\nHere I should like to thank our international partners - the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Economic Community and the African Development Bank - with whom we have enjoyed fruitful cooperation, as well as friendly countries, foremost among them France, which have never failed to provide us with the necessary support.\nWe are now living in the era of international cooperation. In this connection we are witnessing Worth-North development and cooperation, often with a sharing of national sovereignty in various sectors. The revitalization that is now occurring within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which includes the 16 States of Western Africa, and the signature of the treaty for the creation of the African Economic Community on 3 June 1991 at Abuja art signs of our awareness of the overwhelming need for setting up closer South-South cooperation in order to take full advantage of North-South cooperation ~ of course in the interest of both sides.\nThe imperatives of economic growth must not allow us to lose sight of another very important problem that effects all the members of the international community, whatever their level of development. I am referring to the challenge of the environment. Indeed, the constant deterioration of the environment we are witnessing every day affects developing as well as developed countries - for different reasons, of course, but with identical results.\nThe universality of the problem of the environment means that its solution must be sought within the framework of international cooperation based on interdependence and solidarity. That is why we place such great hopes in the forthcoming world Conference on the environment scheduled to be held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 5992. From that Conference we expect real commitments on the part of the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in the face of environmental deterioration, particularly through massive assistance to the developing countries, in general, and in particular to the African countries, which remain the most vulnerable in the short run.\nSolutions to the environment problem must not be focused solely on the symptoms but rather must try to deal with the underlying causes, keeping intersectoral relations in mind, and the repercussions ecological problems can have over several generations, for the challenge we all face at the dawn of the twenty-first century is to improve and preserve insofar as possible the quality of life on our planet.\nIn conclusion, I would point out that in this interdependent world both victories and defeats are shared. The time when democracy is everywhere coming into its own as the true expression of individual freedom, the international community has the imperative duty to assist in the effective consolidation of new democracies by resolutely attacking the true causes of the economic catastrophe the under-developed world is experiencing. I mean by resolutely attacking the question of primary-commodity prices, whether agricultural, mining or mineral - for democracy without development will engender only instability and disorder, both of which defeat the objectives of the democracy that guarantees a more stable and more secure world. Peace, as President Houphouet-Boigny often says, cannot co-exist with poverty.\nWe are at the dawn of a new world order. In Cote d'lvoire, peace has become our second religion. We will spare no effort to bring forth this peace of hearts and minds. We have always given the highest priority to the right to life, that fundamental element of human rights. We therefore express the hope that the new world order will bring forth a world of peace and shared happiness.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. You bring to the presidency a wealth of experience as an accomplished diplomat of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country with which Kenya has very cordial relations. I wish to assure you of my delegation's full support and cooperation as you carry out the heavy responsibilities of your high office.\nI also take this opportunity to compliment your predecessor, the illustrious Foreign Minister of Malta, Mr. Guido de Marco, for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the last session, and for the many missions he undertook on behalf of the General Assembly to convey to the international community the important decisions of the forty-fifth session.\nTo the Secretary-General we express our appreciation for the excellent services which he and his dedicated staff continue to render to the Organization and to the international community. His tireless efforts in the search for international peace and an equitable international order, in which all United Nations Member States, large or small, play an equally important role, have placed him among the truly great statesmen of our time.\nTwo weeks ago seven new Members were admitted into the Organization - the largest single admission in recent years. On behalf of the Government and people of Kenya, I take this opportunity sincerely to congratulate the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on becoming Members of the United Nations. With their membership, the United Nations has moved closer to the realization of the principle of universality. The road to nationhood has been long and, for some, rough, but nevertheless a worthy journey.\nWe laud the new spirit of reconciliation which is emerging and which now underlines the relationship between some of the new Member States and their former adversaries. With the simultaneous entry into the United Nations of the two Koreas, a new chapter has opened which, we hope, will characterize their peace talks aimed at national unity. The current session of the General Assembly offers yet another opportunity to reflect on the dramatic developments that have taken place In the world in recent years. As in the past, the international community is looking to the United Nations for leadership in the search for the maintenance of international peace and stability.\nSix months have passed since the coalition forces mounted a successful operation which restored sovereignty to the people of the State of Kuwait. Never before has our Organization shown such unity of purpose and resolute determination to put an end to naked aggression by a powerful neighbour against a tiny and helpless Member State. Kenya fully supported all the Security Council resolutions on the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, basing its support on the principle of the inadmissibility of acquisition of territories by use of force and the principle that wanton aggression must not go unpunished.\nSeveral important lessons have emerged from the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, one of which is that those who ought to know better were complacent and, indeed, appear to have conspired to place deadly weapons, capable of mass destruction, into the hands of a nation in one of the most volatile regions of the world. For several years Kenya joined other delegations from developing countries in censuring certain developed nations which are also major arms manufacturers and exporters for their silence on questionable arms deals. Since such weapons were never intended for attacks on the suppliers, we had no illusions at all regarding their end use.\nThe time has come for these merchants of weapons of mass destruction and death, be they Governments or private companies in Member States, to put aside greed, profit and naked exploitation, and join the United Nations in calling for a world-wide ban on all chemical weapons and the limitation of trade in arms or greater transparency in their transfers by keeping a register of arms sales.\nWe still hear the sounds of drums of war six months after the end of the operations in the Gulf and what we thought was the beginning of full compliance with all Security Council resolutions. We want to express the sincere hope that sanity and better judgement will prevail over short-sighted, parochial and chauvinistic interests, and thus save humanity from the kind of costly misadventure that nearly plunged this generation into yet another world war.\nWithin the same region, the situation in the Middle East remains tense and fragile. Several resolutions that the United Nations has adopted in the past, aimed at reducing tension and laying the foundation for lasting peace in the Middle East, remain largely un-implemented. The right of Palestinians to a home of their own, as well as the right of the State of Israel to exist, cannot be compromised, nor indeed can the right of all States in that troubled region to live in secure and internationally recognized boundaries.\nSeveral serious attempts have been made, including the current efforts and initiatives of the United States Secretary of State, James Baker, to reduce tension in the Middle East and create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations. We support these efforts as we have in the past, and it is our hope and prayer that they will meet with success.\nKenya believes, as do the majority of Member States, that at the root of the Middle East problem is the question of an equitable and just settlement of the Palestinian issue. Any solution that excludes representation of the Palestinians by those of their own choice is no solution, and will only prolong the misery and agony that have characterised the situation in the region.\nThe need for an international conference on the Middle East, attended by the five permanent members of the Security Council and all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has become more urgent. It is one sure way of arriving at lasting solutions, which should be guaranteed by the United Nations in accordance with its mandate.\nSome of the most far-reaching changes in recent times have taken place in a relatively short span of time. These are changes which, as the Secretary-General has observed, are characterized by both the aspects of hope and the countenance of dangerous un-restraint. Their central theme is the democratisation of human societies everywhere.\nSeveral speakers who have preceded me have eloquently articulated the problems and the prospects, pointing also to inherent dangers, particularly the assumption that there are those who possess a monopoly on truth and on knowledge of what is good for the rest of humanity and what constitutes good governance.\nThere is no country on Earth, indeed no government, in these times and age that can survive unless it protects and strictly upholds the fundamental rights of its citizens. Consequently, the argument is not against the imperative need to observe human rights, good governance, accountability, elimination of corruption and the fight against ethnic antagonism, wherever these social evils exist in our societies. Rather, the argument is about differing interpretations of what constitutes good governance, as well as the authoritarian assertion that if we differ then we must be wrong. In other words, we are being told that we are wrong because our critics are right, and that they are right because they say so.\nThe changes that started in Eastern Europe a few years ago are not necessarily out of the reach of many developing countries. Indeed, most of them were not necessary in the developing countries. Very few minor adjustments here and there are required, because the problems are not the same in the first place. What the developing nations need, more than anything else, is for existing social and economic institutions to be strengthened as a means to create stability for political structures.\nWe are encouraged by statements made by the representatives of the developed North which took cognisance of the need to strengthen democracies in the developing South, not by preaching moral virtues that may be totally alien to the cultural values and aspirations of the developing countries, but by taking concrete measures aimed at raising the living standards in those countries.\nThe world has shrunk into a small global village. We live in an age of electronic media and satellite communication systems. Events in one corner of the world, however remote, are instantly beamed into our homes, as we witnessed during the Gulf crisis. Under the circumstances, it is neither impossible nor difficult, in an age of instant global television, to detect and promptly react to problems as they arise. Natural disasters and calamities, massive transfers or movements of conventional weapons or instances of flagrant abuses of human rights can no longer go without detection.\nThe new international order, for which we all yearn, cannot be the responsibility of any one particular country. Rather, it is the collective responsibility of all of us. The role of the United Nations, as the Gulf crisis recently demonstrated, is a crucial one, and can be successfully played only through the concerted action of all its Members.\nThe General Assembly met in a special session five years ago to consider ways of supporting African efforts to alleviate the severe crisis that has gripped the continent and to lay the foundation for the continent's sustained economic and social development. The Assembly unanimously adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, representing a unique agreement between African States and the international community, in which both sides committed themselves to serious and far-reaching efforts to accelerate Africa's development process. The Programme, which created major expectations for better prospects for Africa, came to an end in July this year. This session of the General Assembly will carry out the final review and appraisal of the implementation of the Programme and make recommendations.\nNevertheless, over the five years of the period of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, the economic and social conditions in the continent have actually worsened. This has occurred despite the many far-reaching measures and reforms undertaken by African countries under extremely adverse external conditions of deteriorating commodity prices, heavy external debt and rising net outflows of financial resources. This session of the Assembly therefore has the responsibility to come out with a clearly defined, action-oriented agreement on international support for the continued efforts of African countries during the 1990s.\nThe international community and the African countries should renew their commitment to a new agenda of cooperation for Africa's sustained social and economic development in the 1990s. To achieve this goal, urgent action is needed to accelerate economic growth to an average real growth rate of at least 6 per cent per annum of gross national product throughout the period of the new agenda, with the aim of increasing income and eradicating poverty.\nIf we fail to observe these guidelines, the new international order will have absolutely no meaning or relevance to the vast majority of the so-called third-world countries, some of whose citizens subsist on less than one dollar a day and whose countries are denied free access to the markets of the developed world through a series of restrictive and protectionist policies.\nThe beginning of this decade saw the reaffirmation of the supremacy of international law in the conduct of inter-State relations. One of the major causes of conflicts between nations throughout history has been failure to observe the basic principles of international law, one of whose cardinal provisions is the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States and their right to control their destinies.\nIt is therefore most fitting that we should be witnessing an increasing awareness of the need for respect for international law at the beginning of this decade, which the General Assembly has declared as the United Nations Decade of International Law. It is my delegation's hope that the declaration will invoke greater respect for international law and create a favourable atmosphere for implementation of the principle that all international disputes should be settled peacefully and through negotiation. This is one sure way of transforming the consensus expressed at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly into specific activities in order to translate the ambitious programmes of the decade into reality.\nSimilarly, the end of 1970s and the beginning of 1960s witnessed a monumental step forward in the development and codification of one aspect of international law. I refer to the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This most important Convention, which has been aptly described as a constitution for the oceans, was primarily to facilitate international cooperation and to promote the peaceful use of the seas and oceans, as well as the equitable and efficient utilization of ocean resources.\nWe note with great concern and regret, however, that the preparatory commission has begun to wind up its work without the broad acceptance that would allow for consistent and uniform application of the Convention. The Convention represents many years of negotiations, which successfully established a delicate balance on issues of global concern, and whose future is now left doubtful.\nIt is my delegation's hope that the Secretary-General will find wide support for his current efforts to bridge the gap between divergent views. Otherwise we shell run the risk of returning to the very uncertainties and instabilities that the Convention on the Law of the Sea was created to address.\nSerious human trauma and tragedy still face the Horn of Africa - an area that, for decades, has witnessed numerous political and social upheavals, resulting in massive suffering of the worst kind ever witnessed in the region. The larger part of the region is on the brink of unprecedented famine. My delegation wishes to bring this matter to the attention of the world community as a matter of urgency. I refer in particular to the plight of the many thousands of women and children who are dying from the lack of basic life-supporting necessities.\nIn the past my country has exerted maximum efforts to deal with the situation arising from the traffic of refugees seeking temporary relief, with assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other donor agencies. This time, however, the dimension and complexity of the problem of refugees in Kenya are far beyond the resources at our disposal. This is especially so because of the number of refugees involved - now more than 200,000 - and the fact that our economy, which is currently under a strenuous structural-adjustment process, is struggling to recover from the effects of the Gulf war, which had a serious effect on our tourist industry.\nThe situation calls for urgent assistance from the international community. I refer in particular to food, medicine, shelter, transport, clothing and other necessities. My President - Mr. Daniel Arap Moi - has already made a passionate plea to the international community for urgent assistance, not only for the refugees in our country but also for those displaced in the Sudan and Somalia, who are facing massive starvation and death.\nAllow me, on behalf of the Government and people of Kenya, to convey our sincere thanks to those Governments and international agencies, as well as non-governmental agencies, that have come to the aid of the refugees in Kenya, and appeal for their continued assistance and valuable support for this worthy humanitarian cause.\nIn this regard, I wish to record the support of my delegation for the proposal made by various delegations - particularly those of the United Kingdom and of Norway, to mention only a few - that a mechanism be put in place to deal more promptly and effectively with such crises. Kenya has cooperated with various United Nations relief agencies and with governmental and non-governmental organizations involved in relief work and in the provision of assistance to neighbouring States. We hope to continue this cooperation in the years to come, in the service of humanity.\nThe importance and urgency of taking appropriate measures to protect the environment from further damage and to preserve it for future generations is a subject of global concern. The preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, scheduled to take place in Brazil in 1992, concluded its third phase in Geneva last month with the warning that a lot of ground remains to be covered before Rio de Janeiro. Kenya hopes that at the fourth and final session, scheduled to take place in New York in March 1992, the remaining issues will be ironed out, and the gap bridged, so that the success of our Conference may be ensured.\nThe very survival of the human race in the years to come will depend increasingly on the ability of man to co-exist in harmony within his environment. All nations -- rich and poor, big and not so big - have a stake in this. The poor, non-industrialised nations must reconcile their development with their environment, just as the rich, developed countries, in the disposal of their industrial wastes, must pay great attention to the problems of preserving a sound environment. Because a good environment is incompatible with poverty, action on environmental control and protection must be addressed simultaneously with the development needs of the poor and developing nations.\nThe Commission on Human Settlements, at its thirteenth session, is recommending to the General Assembly the adoption, at this session, of a draft resolution for the convening of a world conference on human settlements, and is requesting the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Executive Director of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT), to take the necessary steps.\nMy delegation supports this proposal, which would offer a unique opportunity to evaluate and strengthen the progress of HABITAT, bearing in mind the fact that urbanization is becoming a major environmental problem in many developing countries.\nAllow me, before concluding my remarks, to refer to recent developments and changes in South Africa. The leadership in that Republic has demonstrated commitment to the dismantling of the obnoxious policies of apartheid. My delegation believes that the international community - the United Nations in particular - should continue to play the same constructive role that it has played in the past in bringing about the dismantling of apartheid. Although a lot remains to be done, it is the view of my delegation that this Organization ought to take cognisance of the positive changes in the Republic of South Africa and lend its moral support for continued peaceful change.\nLet clear and unmistakable signals go to the racist die-hards of the AWB clique, however, that, in this era of fundamental changes, the international community will not tolerate any attempts to put the clock back, that there will be no place to run to for solace and comfort should they insist on pursuing the short-sighted and outdated policy of racial supremacy.\nNothing could constitute a more gross abuse of human rights than giving comfort to a few die-hard racists who believe that they are destined by God to be a superior race.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset on behalf of the delegation of the Maldives to convey to Ambassador Shihabi our sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His election is a tribute not only to his dedicated contribution to this Organization but also to the country he represents, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which the Maldives has long had ties of friendship and bonds of Islamic brotherhood. I am fully confident that his wise guidance and leadership will enable this session of the General Assembly to deal effectively with the very important issues on its agenda.\nAllow me also to express my delegation's deep appreciation and esteem to His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco, President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session, for the distinction with which he discharged his onerous responsibilities. Maldives rejoices at this session's admission o\u00a3 seven new Member States to membership of our family of independent and sovereign nations, taking us yet another step closer to the realisation of the universality of the Organization. We are indeed happy to see among us the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which share with us many geographical features and entertain similar political and economic aspirations. He warmly welcome to our midst the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, two States with which the Maldives has long enjoyed a cordial and friendly relationship. He hope that their membership in the United Nations will help provide opportunities for the peoples of Korea to reconcile their differences and live in harmony. In addition, we are delighted and honoured to witness the return to the international community of the three Baltic countries, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania.\nAs we are about to carry out the important and difficult task of electing a successor to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar as the Secretary-General, allow me to pay a special tribute to him and salute him with admiration and gratitude. He in the Maldives will remember him as a man of wisdom, patience and great skill in diplomacy, and as a statesman who served the international community in difficult times with conviction and dignity. I take this opportunity to wish him well in the years to come.\nWe have witnessed dramatic changes on the international political scene during recent years. These changes have taken place in such rapid succession that the world has had to hasten to adjust itself to the changing realities. The events continue to flow one after another, giving us unprecedented opportunities for peace and for building a new world order based on justice and equality. This makes the current session of the General Assembly a very critical one. The United Nations, being the most universal of all international organizations, needs to address itself to these changes. More important, it needs to play a revitalized role as the guardian, as the broker and as the enforcer of peace and justice in the world. Let us at this moment, leaning on the lofty principles of our Charter, jointly show some creativity and redefine our objectives as the founding fathers of the Organization did 45 years ago.\nAmong other significant events in recent months, we have seen the happy ending of the cold-war escapades, and perhaps with it the East-West competition for supremacy, which sadly haunted the human race for over 40 years. While applauding the players for their vision and courageous decisions, we remain cautious about what the new world order promises us for the future. The expectations are no doubt high, and the demands are increasing as we go on dismantling the policies and alliances which imposed on the world an unjustified status quo, inhibiting the process of peace and justice. We are particularly apprehensive about whether this new order will be fair to the developing countries - especially the least developed among them.\nMy delegation is of the view that a new world order - if there is going to be one - should be fair and just, based on the very principles we have striven to put into effect in the past. It should be an order of peace and peaceful coexistence, tolerance and sensible compromise. It would be a pity if we were to allow fads of political hegemony, extreme protectionism, hard-core nationalism, and/or racism to grow again under our feet as we sit enjoying the comfort of the breeze blowing today; indeed this could have dire consequences. The new order should be democratically formulated and jointly implemented; an order that would address the concerns of the peoples in the North and South, East and West, without discrimination or privilege. In our endeavour to establish the new world order, we should never lose sight of the lofty principles enshrined  in the Charter of the United Nations. The new order should have as its pillars the principles of sovereign equality, territorial Integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations.\nThe responsibilities of the international community at this critical juncture in history are multifold. They include in the immediate term the acceleration of the process of disarmament, peaceful settlement of ongoing disputes, and the strengthening of the concept of legitimacy and the rule of law in relations between and among States.\nIn this context, we deeply appreciate the positive steps taken by the United States and the Soviet Union in the field of disarmament. In particular, we welcome the recent initiative taken by President Bush in declaring the decision of the United States Government to relinquish its short-range nuclear weapons. We are also encouraged by the positive response from President Gorbachev. We hope that this historic decision will set the tone for the long-anticipated process of eliminating all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. We would definitely like to see an immediate halt to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, not only in the areas of conflict but also at the global and the regional levels.\nOur attention is similarly focused at this juncture on the urgent need for a durable solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the core of which still remains the question of Palestine. We feel that a just and comprehensive settlement of the question of the Middle East will be possible only if the process includes recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self- determination and to establish a State\nof their own on their own homeland. We hope that the recent efforts led by the United States, aimed at the convening of a peace conference, will produce positive results.\nThe problem of Cyprus is another issue which deserves our immediate attention. While supporting the relentless efforts of the Secretary General to resolve the question, we sincerely urge all parties concerned to make a renewed effort to reach an early settlement of the dispute on the basis of Security Council resolution 649 (1990), which we believe set forth a fair and practical means of reaching a comprehensive settlement of the dispute.\nWe have witnessed positive movements In South Africa towards the abolition of the evil system of apartheid, which is an affront to the entire human race. Although there have been some changes, it is a system not even one iota of which is acceptable. Therefore, my delegation supports the continuation of the international sanctions that have been imposed on the racist regime until the whole system of apartheid is totally dislodged.\nThe recent initiative of the permanent members of the Security Council, along with the relentless efforts of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), gives us hope for the settlement of the Cambodian issue. However, we remain concerned about the situation in Afghanistan, where, despite the withdrawal of foreign troops and the agreements that have been signed between the parties, the fighting continues, preventing millions of Afghan people from returning to their homes and resuming a normal life. We call upon all parties concerned to resolve the problem urgently.\nThe Gulf crisis was an experience from which the world learned many lessons. The swift and determined reaction of the international community to repel the aggression against Kuwait should be commended. The demonstration of the working of the collective security system emphasised the need for strengthening the concept, of, and the mechanism for, international collective security. It also highlighted the fact that such a system needs to be consistently adhered to if international peace and security is to be maintained. There should be no differentiation between countries on the basis of size, power and economic wealth in the application of the Charter. The Gulf crisis and many other recent events have also highlighted the vulnerability of small States and their need for international support in facing security threats of different natures.\nWe remain strongly convinced that the issue of collective security, including the special problems of the small States, should be kept high on our agenda as we embark on a new international order. In the wake of the current trend towards the easing of international tension, a trend brought about as a result of dialogue and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, the United Nations is being asked to play an increasingly active role as the guarantor of international peace and security. It is a challenge and responsibility that the Organization can effectively accept only with the firm and continued support of all its Members, particularly the larger and more powerful States. For small States like the Maldives the United Nations has always been, and will always remain, the best hope for warding off challenges to their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nTherefore, the Maldives will be keen, with many other small Member States in this Organization, once again to review the issue of protection and security of small States during the current .session of the General Assembly, and we hope that we will find the same support and sympathy amongst the members of this body as we did two years ago when we initially put forward a proposal on this issue at the forty fourth session. In this respect, I should like to draw the attention of Member States to the Secretary General's report on the subject, which recognised, inter alia, that because of their intrinsic characteristics small States may need a special measure of attention and support and that, the international community has a vested Interest in safeguarding the security of small States. It also said that small States have a limited capacity to provide for their own security.\nThis is a very valid observation with regard to the realities that we face in our countries. We have a very narrow economic base, and thus any attempt to strengthen the security forces would entail a drainage of resources from other areas of development. At the same time, even a very short disruption of the political and economic mechanism of a country like ours by international adventurers, such as narco-terrorists or mercenaries, would do major harm to the economy, which might require a very long time to recover.\nEnvironmental degradation is an issue which the new world order should have on its priority list. It is an issue which could threaten the very existence of many of our nations represented here at this Assembly. It has been a key concern of the Maldives, given the threats posed due to global warming and possible sea-level rise, which could endanger the very survival of our island nation. Indeed, environmental disasters of even a minor magnitude can have serious implications in countries like the Maldives, as was evidenced during late May this year, when we were hit by unusually strong storms, causing extensive damage. I should like to take this opportunity to express my Government's sincere gratitude for the generous assistance rendered by the international community in roping with relief and rehabilitation measures taken by the Government in connection with this disaster.\nIn concert with other South Asian nations, the Maldives Is currently Involved in the finalization of two important, environmental studies, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) study of natural disasters and the study of the greenhouse effect and its impact, on the region. It is our intention to have these two studies completed in time for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil next year. The Maldives looks forward with eager anticipation to participating in this very important Conference, with the hope that the Conference will be able to draw up a global environmental strategy that will ensure the protection and preservation of the environment and promote sustainable development for the benefit of future generations.\nNo agenda of a new international order could fail to include an item on developmental issues. It is this magic term \\\"development\\\" that all countries are striving for. All countries are aspiring to better development of their infrastructure, so that their citizens may enjoy a higher standard of living. However, in what should now be called the old order the opportunities for development were not fair. A small group of countries attained an extremely high standard of living at the expense of the rest of us. The terms of trade and other economic realities have been manipulated to maintain the group of us called \\\"the loss developed countries\\\" less developed. With decreasing tensions in the political and military spheres, it is hoped that the resources otherwise channelled to building weaponry will be utilized in helping the less developed countries, attain their aspirations. This we hope will be the peace dividend.\nIt is with these hopes and aspirations that we are beginning another session of the Assembly. We have an atmosphere which augurs well for the achievement of these aspirations and hopes, which we have held for a long time. We have never had an opportunity like this In the history of the Organisation. Therefore, we should not let this opportunity fade away.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWithin the framework of the peace plan for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian conflict - a plan adopted on 28 August 1990 by the five permanent members of the Security Council and unanimously approved by the Security Council in its resolution 668 (1990) and by acclamation by our General Assembly in its resolution 45/3 of 15 October 1990 - the Supreme National Council of Cambodia was created. The Council is the sole legitimate organ embodying the sovereignty and unity of Cambodia, and the sole source of authority during the transitional period until free and fair elections can be held, organised and supervised under United Nations control.\nIt is in my capacity as President, of this Supreme National Council and on behalf of the new united, independent and sovereign Cambodia and its people what I have today the honour and the privilege of addressing this Assembly.\nMy delegation welcomes with deep satisfaction. Sir, your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of our General Assembly. It is a special tribute to your people and your country, Saudi Arabia. I am delighted to convey to you my warmest congratulations. We believe that your experience and well-known competence will ensure the success of our proceedings.\nI also pay a sincere tribute to His Excellency Guido De Marco, eminent son of Malta, who by his remarkable personal diplomatic qualities and wisdom so successfully led the proceedings of the forty-fifth session of our General Assembly.\nThis year we welcome to our Organisation seven new Member States: the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Supreme National Council of Cambodia welcomes them to our Organization, conveys its warmest greetings to their respective Governments and peoples, and assures them of its desire to establish with them friendly and fruitful relations. Their presence within our Organization is a testimony to the great vitality and growing prestige of the United Nations.\nI take this auspicious opportunity to pay the warmest possible tribute to His Excellency the Secretary-General for his noble and tireless activities in the service of many countries and peoples that have faced great difficulties. Under his leadership the United Nations has been reborn and its prestige increased through the active and fruitful cooperation between the Member \nearnings are diverted into debt-servicing, the prospect of many of our economies regressing into a state of subsistence is not idle speculation.\nThe concern that the International community, through the General Assembly, has shown over the accelerating degradation of the global environment and the drug menace should encourage us to appreciate the unsustainability of the world's development models and life-styles. While in the industrialised countries it is prosperity that is at the root of environmental degradation, in the developing countries it is poverty that accounts for that state of affairs.\nThe depletion of the ozone layer that leads to global warming is the direct consequence of industrialization in the developed world. In the developing world, the necessity to eke out existence from the land and water has shown up as desertification and pollution. The Beijing Declaration of June this year aptly recognized that the inequities in current international economic relations not only have constrained the economic development of the developing countries, but have also undermined their capability to participate effectively in global environmental efforts. Resolution 44/226, which the General Assembly adopted last year, provided relevant guidelines for global discussions on the transfer of technology and financial resources, and should safely guide our discussions preparatory to and during the international Conference on Environment and Development.\nIt is again poverty in the developing countries that largely explains the resort to drug trafficking. Ghana has, without hesitation, joined in the international effort against the drug menace. We have passed laws that prescribe severe penalties, including confiscation of property, huge monetary fines and long prison terms. We have also adopted policy measures aimed at it. \nHe are aware that, having worked so hard and made so many sacrifices in the service of the United Nations and the peoples of the world, he has decided not to request a new mandate but to take a well-deserved retirement. Nevertheless, our Cambodia has the conviction that the United Nations and the peoples of this Earth still have a very great need of his services and of his invaluable assistance in overcoming the difficulties that exist in certain parts of the world. Thus we take the liberty of expressing the warm wish that he will agree to continue at the helm of the United Nations for some years to come. He are persuaded that a great many countries would renew their trust in him in defending the great ideals of peace and development to which all peoples are profoundly attached. It is understood, of course, that Cambodia fully respects his own free choice.\nAfter 12 years of war, destruction and suffering, my country, Cambodia, and its people are once again united. This monumental achievement has been made possible thanks to the help and continuous support for a period of several years of all justice-loving and freedom-loving countries, true friends of Cambodia and its people, and also thanks to the will of all Cambodian patriots who have united to put an end to the bloody and destructive Cambodian tragedy that lasted from 1970 to 1990. A new era of peace is opening up before us, and, while it is true that the road leading us to a future of national reconciliation, national unity and general development in peace is still a long and painful one strewn with obstacles, it is also full of hope and the desire to see our homeland resume the place it deserves in the family of nations and achieve progress and development.\nThe progress achieved in Jakarta and Pattaya in June 1991, in Beijing in July 1991, in Pattaya again in August 1991 and, most recently, in New York - where the major issues relating to a cease-fire, the cessation of external military aid, the demobilisation of armed forces, political and electoral systems for Cambodia and the declaration of fundamental human rights were settled - augurs well for the future. The Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which will resume its work on about 21 October 1991, will permit us to finalise and sign the long-awaited agreement on the comprehensive settlement of the Cambodia conflict.\nThe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) will soon be in a position to help the Supreme National Council to make Cambodia an independent State with full territorial integrity and a liberal democracy, neutral, non-aligned and friendly to all those countries that respect our independence, our territorial integrity and our neutrality. The Supreme National Council and UNTAC constitute the two key inseparable elements of the United Nations Peace Plan for Cambodia.\nDuring the past three months the Supreme National Council of Cambodia has adopted by consensus a number of very important decisions on the military and civil arrangements contained in the draft agreements for a comprehensive political settlement. This has been achieved thanks to the spirit of compromise and of national reconciliation that has been nurtured by all the members of the Supreme National Council. I pay a tribute to the patriotism and commitment to the ideals of peace and national unity shown by the 11 other members of the Supreme National Council and their trust in their elected President. This has allowed us to overcome great difficulties and resolve major problems at the meetings held in Pattaya, Beijing, Pattaya again and New York. \nOn behalf of Cambodia and its Supreme National Council and its people, I wish to express our deep and sincere gratitude to all the countries, peoples and personalities concerned, particularly those of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Australia and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the two co-Chairmen of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his distinguished colleagues. Without their combined, tireless and noble efforts, we should not have been able to reach the present stage of the peace process.\nI wish to pay a particular and respectful tribute to Their Majesties the King and Queen of Thailand, to the Royal Thai Government and to the Thai people. I wish to express once again to them our everlasting and profound gratitude for their constant compassion and generous hospitality, protection and varied assistance to more than 350,000 Khmer refugees on Thai soil.\nI should like also to express my gratitude to all those countries which have been kind enough to grant asylum to thousands of Cambodian refugees, as well as to all the relief and humanitarian assistance bodies of the United Nations and the governmental and non-governmental agencies of many countries which have for approximately 13 years now been giving help and assistance to our unfortunate compatriots living in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border. \n\nAs the people of Cambodia prepare for a more stable and harmonious\nfuture, they are having to cope with severe floods caused by storms and torrential rains. The immense damage caused by the floods will involve us in an extra effort to rebuild our country. In response to the appeal that I made on 23 August for emergency-relief assistance for our unfortunate compatriots who were the victims of this disaster, a number of countries took immediate steps to come to our help. I wish to express our heartfelt thanks to the United Nations and our Secretary-General and to Australia, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Hew Zealand and Viet Nam, as well as in the international organizations that replied so promptly to my appeal. With their generous help, we have been able, to a certain extent, to restore normality in the regions affected. To those countries that are able to provide further assistance to our people I appeal that they do so as soon as possible.\nI wish to take this opportunity to draw attention to a matter that concerns me deeply. For many years I have been deeply disturbed by the almost total saturation of Cambodian soil with land mines. These mines have already crippled a great number of our people - men and women - and they pose a constant danger to life. Today I appeal for a world-wide ban on the use of mines - beginning in Cambodia.\nOver the past year we have seen major changes in our world - changes that augur well for the future of international relations. Detente between East and West continues to develop. Several nations have achieved independence and freedom without bloodshed. For its part, Cambodia will adopt a policy of neutrality and non-alignment and of solidarity with all the peoples struggling against injustice and discrimination and for freedom, and with all those countries that are fighting to obtain respect for human rights.\nseIf-determination and everything else included in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the five principles of peaceful co-existence and those of non-alignment.\nMy delegation warmly supports the wise and highly patriotic proposals for the reunification of Korea put forward by Marshal Kim II Sung, President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Me are happy to note that contacts between the two parts of Korea have increased with a view to achieving national reconciliation, which will lead, at a later stage, to reunification. We encourage their efforts and hope that, now that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea have become full Members of this Organisation, the process of reunification will be accelerated. Korea is one country, not two.\nMy delegation supports the efforts of the Palestinian people to recover their fundamental national rights. We hope that the international peace conference will take place soon and that, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), it will succeed in securing the right of all the countries and peoples in the Middle East, including Palestine and Israel, to live in peace and stability within borders recognised by the international community.\nMy delegation is encouraged by the progress that has been made in settling the conflicts affecting Afghanistan, Lebanon, Cyprus and Western Sahara. We also welcome the progress that has been achieved in South Africa towards the dismantling of apartheid and the negotiations that are taking place for the purpose of establishing there a democratic and non-racial regime.\nWhile working to establish peace and national reconciliation and to achieve a comprehensive political settlement of its problem in accordance with \nthe United Rations peace plan, Cambodia will contribute actively to the building of a better world where peace and prosperity, with justice and democratic freedoms, will prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis session of the General Assembly is taking place in a world that has undergone fundamental change. The United Nations is the focal point of mankind's new hopes and expectations. This makes your office, Mr. President, one of special responsibility. I wish you luck and success and greet you as the representative of a country with which we, Germany, have long-standing close relations.\nI welcome most heartily the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as new Members of the United Nations. They had lost their freedom and independence in 1940 as a result of that criminal document, the Hitler-Stalin pact. All the greater, therefore, is the pleasure felt by us Germans at the fact that history has at long last justly rewarded these courageous peoples with the freedom they longed for.\nI welcome the two Korean States. We hop\u00ab that the wish of the Korean people will be fulfilled, that they will be able, like the German people, to live in freedom and democracy in one sovereign and independent State. I also welcome the Marshall Islands and Micronesia to the family of nations.\nEvery year since 1974 I have addressed this Assembly on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany. On each occasion I have expressed our intention to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German people could recover their unity in free self-determination. On 3 October 1990 that wish came true.\nAt this moment I commemorate all those who had to sacrifice their lives and their freedom in prisons and camps because they wanted to live in a European Germany of freedom, democracy and human rights. We pay a tribute to all those who, is what was then the German Democratic Republic, as everywhere in Central and Eastern Europe, took to the streets to gain freedom, democracy and unity by peaceful means.\nToday I address the Assembly for the first time as the Foreign Minister of united Germany. Germany takes its place in the family of United Nations on the basis of the United Nations Charter.\nAs a European country, we are committed to the Charter of Paris. We Germans regard the greater weight of our people united in one State as a mandate to assume greater responsibility for freedom, democracy and human rights in a European Germany which has put behind it the nation-State thinking of the past. While the division of Germany made manifest the division of Europe, German unity today contributes to the unification of the whole European continent.\nEurope stands at a crossroads in its history. We Germans want this Europe to develop in close transatlantic solidarity. The North Atlantic alliance and the involvement of the United States and Canada in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process are a reflection of that solidarity. The European Community's transatlantic declaration underscores the will for ever closer European-North American cooperation.\nThe aims of the policy of united Germany are as follows:\nFirst, we want the European Community, of which we are a founding member, to develop into a European Union and ultimately into the United States of Europe. We want this year to bring a final decision in favour of political union and economic and monetary union.\nSecond, we want all democratic States in Europe to be able to accede to this Community. For the new democracies in Eastern Europe which are introducing market economies the way must be opened, through association, to full membership.\nThird, we want to bring the whole of Europe ever closer together on the basis of the Charter of Paris. We also want the peoples of the Soviet Union, who are adopting a new form of coexistence as sovereign republics, to take their place in this Europe.\n\nEurope will find its new order in confederal structures; these will manifest themselves in different forms. They will take account of existing structures and will afford the regions new opportunities. With greater unity, Europe will at the same time acquire greater diversity.\nIt is the responsibility of the Western democracies also to establish the material conditions for European unity so that new boundaries do not divide Europe into haves and have-nots. Mew priorities will have to be fixed for material assistance as well. Germany is facing up to this task: as Europeans, we aim, together with other Europeans, to create one Europe by providing assistance for our Eastern neighbours. No one in the West will be permanently well off if those in the East are permanently badly off.\nFourth, as a country in the heart of Europe, we want to devote all our energy to achieving the unity of our continent. This is underscored by the unique link between Germany and France. Also important in this process is the close cooperation with our Eastern neighbours. I emphasised this in the Declaration of Weimar, signed on 29 August 1991 with my French colleague, Roland Dumas, and my Polish colleague. Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski.\nAs the door to unity began to open for the German people in the autumn of 1989, I stated here before the United Nations on 27 September that year that we wanted Poland to know that the Polish people's\n\n\\\"... right to live within secure borders will not be called into question, not now or in the future, through territorial claims by us Germans\\\". (A/44/PV.8. p. 18) That was a signal, not only to the Polish people but to all our neighbours. \nThat statement was incorporated into the two-plus-four Treaty and the German-Polish Treaty, which is at present being debated by the parliaments of both countries. The German-Czechoslovak Treaty on good-neighbourly Relations and Friendly Cooperation is likewise about to be signed. These treaties, like the major treaty with the Soviet Union and the treaties with the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe still to come, manifest our intention to work towards one Europe. Our relationship with the Soviet Union has meanwhile assumed central importance for the whole of Europe.\nThe German people are emphasising their determination to draw the conclusions from the ill-fated chapters of our history in this century and to help build a Europe based on responsibility and not on the power politics of the past.\nFifth, we want the Western alliance to continue its efforts to ensure stability throughout Europe in a changing political environment. The contacts already established with the former members of the Warsaw Pact, including the Soviet Union, must be developed into a comprehensive partnership for security. Cooperative security structures must emerge. Our alliance, as Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel confirmed in his address to the NATO Council on 21 March, 1991, was never a threat to others.\nThe ending of the East-West confrontation has opened the way for the radical reduction of excessively large military arsenals. We want conventional disarmament to be pursued consistently, in accordance with the first Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. We want a global prohibition on chemical weapons. We want the removal of short-range nuclear missiles and of nuclear artillery ammunition - this is urgent: such weapons are increasingly destabilizing; the danger of their proliferation is growing they must disappear at long last. We expect the nuclear Powers to continue the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.\nSixth, we want to make the CSCE capable of action. After the establishment of the Council of CSCE Foreign Ministers and of the CSCE emergency mechanism, I submitted specific proposals at the CSCE Conference on the Human Dimension, held in Moscow on 10 September this year, aimed at more effective protection for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It must also be possible to afford such protection without the consent of the country concerned.\nThe right to self-determination and, directly linked with it, the rights of minorities, must be respected everywhere. Europe is heading towards more identity and more plurality. From this must not emerge neo-nationalism. European structures must absorb these developments. For all questions we must have a European response. That is a task for the European Community, and it is a task for the CSCE.\nThe crisis-management capability of the CSCE must be enhanced. The less necessary it becomes to protect oneself from threats from outside, the more we need a system in which all cooperate in guaranteeing common security. If we together learn to guarantee our security from one another, we in Europe will be on the way to a collective system of security.\nSeventh, we Germans want the new Europe to exercise its global responsibility. It should not and will not be introspective. The trend towards a Euro-Atlantic area of cooperation stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok opens up a historic opportunity for development for the countries of the South as well.\nThe world economic summit of the seven industrial nations - including Japan - faces its greatest test where global responsibilities are concerned. The triad of Worth America, Europe and Japan must prove its worth. The third world will not remain in the shadow of this development. It will benefit vitally from this new era.\nThe ending of the East-West conflict in Europe is at last releasing those energies tied up by the cold war which mankind now needs in order to solve the global challenges of the twenty-first century. The first fruits of this new development are already appearing. The East-West confrontation is no longer being staged in the third world. Freedom is emerging in Angola and in Cambodia, and in Afghanistan too there are signs of hope.\nIn the Middle East as well a historic opportunity for peace is opening up. We all hope that at the forthcoming peace conference all participants will at long last realize that there is no justifiable alternative to a genuine balance of interests that gives Israel security and peace and the Palestinians self-determination. With great commitment and unending patience. Secretary of State Baker has paved the way for such a balance. In this he has Germany's full support. The General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism must be repealed. We support the American initiative in that regard.\nIn South Africa, President De Klerk and Nelson Mandela have taken decisive steps toward creating a South Africa free from oppression and racial hatred. All citizens of that country must participate with equal rights in its political, economic and social life. This must be guaranteed by a new constitution. A democratic South Africa can and must become a locomotive of development and stability in a region still afflicted by poverty and conflicts.\nThe economic fruits of the new development in Europe are likewise discernible. As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has calculated, the single European market will mean a 7 per cent increase in the exports of developing countries to the European Community. That will boost their earnings by $10 billion. And if in a few years' time Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union become regions of dynamic growth, they will also develop into important new markets for exports from the South. Above all, however, the end of the arms race between East and Heat will release tremendous energies which will benefit the third world above all.\nEighth, we Germans want the United Nations to become the main forum for action in the new world order. To that end, it is absolutely essential that Security Council resolutions be implemented, completely and unconditionally. Aggressors like Saddam Hussein must no longer be permitted to keep people in constant fear with aggression and means of mass destruction. We support President Bush in his resolve to counteract fresh provocations. Our world Organization must be able to meet the challenges of the new era. Conflict prevention, demographic policy and environmental protection must be improved.\nThe ending of the East-West conflict has freed the world Organization from its paralysis. This new freedom to act must now be used. Germany is prepared to play its part. The united Germany will assume all rights and meet a11 obligations of the United Nations Charter, including measures of collective security, also with our armed forces. For this purpose we intend to amend our constitution.\nNinth, in order to improve coordination of United Nations disaster relief measures, we advocate the appointment of a high-ranking representative exclusively responsible to the Secretary-General. This person would have to coordinate all international relief measures and have immediately available an emergency fund and national rescue and relief services.\nWe want to enhance the status of the Secretary-General himself. He has frequently spoken of this necessity, and rightly so. Now his tenure is coming to an end. The world has come to respect him as a guardian of peace, a champion of human rights, and an advocate of the poor. In an era of epochal change, he has, with clear vision and a firm hand, enhanced the reputation of the United Nations. For this the family of nations owes him a debt of gratitude and appreciation.\nTenth, we want to strengthen the instruments asserting the rule of law in the world. The experience of our history has committed us in a special way to freedom, the rule of law and human rights. We pursue these goals in Europe, and we intend to pursue them in the United Nations as well. He intend to pursue a policy which focuses on the individual, makes human rights and human dignity the measures of all human action and does not paralyze people's energy and enterprise.\nThe world today realizes that this is a precondition for prosperity, social progress and peace. It also realizes that despotism negates development and freedom. The alarming figure of 15 million refugees worldwide shows that the world is still far from ensuring adequate protection for human rights and the rights of minorities.\nThe violation of human rights must no longer be a domestic concern of individual States but a domestic concern of the community of nations as a whole. Today sovereignty must meet its limits in the responsibility of States for mankind as a whole and for the survival of Creation. When human rights are trampled under foot, the family of nations is not confined to the role of spectator. It can - it must - intervene.\nWe are witness to the persecution of the Kurdish people. Anyone who threatens peoples with genocide, anyone who deliberately destroys nature's already fragile equilibrium in an entire region, must be brought to account before an international tribunal. We call for an international court of justice of the United Nations where crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, genocide, war crimes and environmental criminality can be prosecuted and punished. We call for a court of justice to which anyone who feels that his human rights have been violated may appeal. We call for the proscription of torture and capital punishment.\nWe need an effective international environmental law regime with appropriate international controls. It must be possible to impose sanctions on countries that deliberately destroy the environment. We also have to effectively prevent environmental warfare. I ask the General Assembly to support the draft resolution on this important matter which Germany proposes to introduce.\nWe call upon all States to accede to the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, and we call for sanctions against countries which tolerate hostage-taking. The World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place in 1993, must deal with those questions that are of such vital importance for a new culture of international coexistence. We are looking forward to hosting the Conference in Berlin, that symbol of a new era of humanity and solidarity in Europe.\nEleventh, as in the case of civil human rights, we seek protection for economic and social human rights. The united Germany will continue to render a significant contribution to the development of the third world. In spite of the challenges presented by economic and ecological reconstruction in central and eastern Europe, the diversion of capital from South to East that had been feared has not taken place. This reflects the determination of the Western industrial nations to live up to their responsibility for development on a global scale.\nGermany, in spite of the enormous domestic strain on its resources and the disproportionately high level of support for its eastern neighbours, has increased its official development assistance even more. Furthermore, the German people last year donated more than 1 billion Deutschmarks for humanitarian purposes in third-world countries. This is proof that their own country's problems and those of central and eastern Europe have not caused them to forget the plight of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nThere is a growing appreciation in third-world countries that it is not enough simply to expect the donor countries to do their duty, but that they themselves are primarily responsible for putting their houses in order. In future the German Government will, more than previously, make its assistance\nConditional upon the extent to which recipients are prepared to create the right pluralistic, rule-of-law and free-market framework. Countries which are more concerned with strengthening their armies than seeing to the needs of their people can no longer count on our support. Considering the degree of hunger and poverty, annual military spending of close to $200 billion by the third world is irresponsible. The responsibility lies with the buyers and sellers of weapons alike. The mere freezing of this military expenditure would save about $15 billion a year - about one quarter of annual development assistance.\nThe restriction of arms exports requires, as a first step, greater transparency. Since 1980 I have been urging the world Organisation to establish a register in which transfers of weapons would be recorded. This proposal, which is now being advocated by the European Community as a whole, should, during this session of the General Assembly, at long last meet with broad support. We Germans will place even greater restrictions on the export of arms.\nHeavy indebtedness remains for many countries one of the greatest obstacles to development. The debate on Africa has shown that we need a new arrangement particularly for the poorest countries. The amount of debt remission should correspond to the plight of the country concerned. The markets of the North must not remain closed. This situation is depriving the South of proceeds from foreign exchange amounting to an estimated $100 billion a year. That is about twice the total sum of development aid. This is why the outcome of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations is not a matter for the industrial countries among themselves. It affects above all the future of the developing countries.\nTwelfth, we want the third-world countries to participate on an equal footing in the dialogue on mankind's future, in all respects - political, economic, ecological and cultural. As before, we regard the Non-Aligned Movement as an indispensable source of global stability. Mankind's new challenges, the greater interdependence and responsibility of the community of nations make new forms of dialogue based on partnership between East and Nest and between North and South imperative. The global trend towards a free society, pluralistic democracy and market economy has created new, favourable conditions for such a \\\"dialogue of the one world\\\". He must now use this opportunity.\nWhile we are here debating the common future tasks of the world community, war is being waged in Europe. People are being killed, are bleeding to death. Fighting is going on in Croatia - but not only there. The President and the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia say that the army has placed itself beyond political control. They have appealed to the United Nations. The peoples of Yugoslavia have a right to peace. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the European Community and the Western European Union (WEU) are striving to bring about a cease-fire and a peace agreement. For this they require the support of the community of nations and the Security Council. He expect a binding weapons embargo. He expect the Security Council to adopt a clear, unequivocal position so that the fighting can be stopped. The use of force to achieve political ends must remain unlawful. We shall never recognize the acquisition of territory by force. Anyone aiming to alter Yugoslavia's internal and external borders by force is challenging the very foundations of human coexistence. Germany has in recent decades developed friendly relations with all peoples of Yugoslavia. We do not take sides against one people or another; we take the side of the women and mothers who do not want their husbands and sons to die in a senseless war. We take the aide of peace against war, of human rights, of the rights of minorities and the right to self-determination. We wish success to the peace conference that we together with France proposed to the arbitration commission and to the mediator. Lord Carrington. Within the framework of the European Community and the CSCE arbitration mechanism we shall make every effort to achieve a peace settlement in which the peoples of Yugoslavia alone will determine their future, as the CSCE Foreign Ministers decided under my chairmanship in Berlin on 19 June 1991.\nOn the threshold of the new millennium mankind faces a global challenge that overshadows all else: that of fighting poverty, reducing population growth and protecting the natural sources of life. What the twenty-first century will look like depends on the decisions we take in the next 10 years.\nThe concern with freedom in the past two years has changed the countenance of Europe, indeed of the world, at breathtaking speed. What could not be changed in that short period were the economic and social conditions of the people. If a billion people have to manage on less than one dollar a day, if 23 per cent of the world's population commands over 85 per cent of the world's income, then everybody's security is threatened. Mau is still waging war against creation.\nWe need a comprehensive peace pact between peoples, between nations, and between man and nature. These are the tasks for a new world domestic policy.\nWe need to realise that the social issue on a global scale is the great challenge of the new era. Only decent human conditions for all create freedom. It is only to this kind of freedom that the future will belong. In the last three and a half decades the population of the third world has almost doubled. In the next generation the developing countries will account for over 80 per cent of the world's population. Today already, more than one third of the world's population is undernourished. What will the situation be like a generation hence? This question in itself indicates the whole dimension of our responsibility. Our task is to meet the needs of the present and at the same time protect the Interests of future generations - and also to attempt to reconcile economy and ecology.\nThe accumulation of arms during the cold war has consumed astronomical sums. How it is a question of directing our combined efforts to the central task of the twenty-first century: solving the world's social, demographic and ecological problems and pursuing disarmament.\nThis is the spiritual and moral challenge confronting the nations of the world. New thinking is required from each one of us. The signs are there. When did the voice of freedom and democracy speak with such force as today? It is true: the world ha3 changed fundamentally. It has changed through the spirit of freedom. Everywhere human rights and human dignity are gaining ground. Hardly ever have we been more aware of this than on 21 August this year, when the Moscow coup against freedom failed. On exactly that day 23 years previously the Soviet army had brutally crushed the Prague Spring. This time the soldiers of the same army refused to shoot at the people who had gathered in Moscow's \\\"Square of Free Russia\\\" to defend freedom and democracy with their lives. There it became clear to the whole world:\nMikhail Gorbachev's courageous reformist policy has become irreversible. Today already he has taken his place in the annals of history.\nThe events of that day gave the lie to all those in the West who did not believe that the peoples of the Soviet Union had the will for freedom and democracy. Boris Yeltsin, Eduard Shevardnadze, Anatoly Sobchak, Gavril Popov and Alexander Yakovlev stood unshakably with many, many of their fellow-citizens for freedom and peace.\nWhat Europe and the world was twice denied in this century our generation has the chance to fulfil: President Bush's vision of a new world order. It is the vision of a world community sharing responsibility on the basis of law, the self-determination of nations, international solidarity and respect for man and nature.\nIf this historic opportunity for new and lasting international solidarity is not to evaporate through economic want, then the West just not forsake the people who risked their lives for freedom. I said it in Davos in 1987 and I say it again today: this concerns Europe's, America's and Japan's joint responsibility for global peace. The chance to create a lastingly free and democratic new Soviet Union is a chance for the whole world.\nThe German American philosopher Hans Jonas said: \\\"Hope derives from responsibility for the universe\\\". Europe has reflected on its fundamental values and is building its common home. In spite of all the difficulties, this peaceful undertaking is a message of hope to the world.\nThe united Germany places itself for all time on the side of freedom and democracy, on the side of human rights and human dignity, on the side of the right of self-determination and of protection for minorities. The German people side once and for all with the inalienable values which alone permit a humane society to develop. That is the message of the united Germany to the community of nations to which I have the honour to speak here today for the first time as the representative of one Germany. As a European Germany we intend to face the global challenges. In this we regard every person on earth as our neighbour.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn the name of the people and Government of Colombia, allow me to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We place great hopes in the results of the work of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly under his illustrious leadership. It will be the task of the Assembly to point the United Nations in the right direction in order for it to carry out the purposes and principles of its Charter at this crucial phase of our history.\nI should also like to express the appreciation of the Government of Colombia for the work of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. Ten years of intelligent and unstinting effort in the service of international peace and justice give the measure of this man. We acknowledge the scope of his contribution and salute him as a Latin American who has brought honour to our region. He is aware of our admiration and appreciation and is familiar with the wishes that were expressed collectively by the Heads of State of Latin America at the summit meeting at Guadalajara.\nI welcome the admission of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands to membership of the Organization and I welcome their participation in the General Assembly's debates.\nWe are living in a time of profound change, which will have a formidable impact on the future of each of our countries. However, the ambitious mandate of the United Nations remains in force. That speaks well for the vision of those who were its founders. It would be very hard for us to cast this mandate in different terms today. The maintenance of peace, the defence of citizens' rights and the attainment of the collective well-being through growth and development continue to be the guiding principles in relations between States.\nYet a significant change can be seen in the very rapidity of the adjustments and transformations we are witnessing. Hence, we call upon members urgently to pursue the objectives referred to and to take advantage of this session of the General Assembly to reflect on the challenges of our times.\nColombia has always been an enthusiastic supporter of multilateralism and cooperation as the irreplaceable cornerstones of an international system that is committed to meeting the needs of the developing world. Without peace there can be no growth or development, and it is only by establishing social justice and eradicating poverty that lasting peace can be achieved. A stable peace requires that nations establish the social and economic conditions necessary to deal properly with their principal needs.\nIn the light of the relaxation of East-West tensions, and since there must be a constructive dialogue between North and South, it will be up to the United Nations system to ensure and protect the right of States which, unlike the great Powers, do not have effective defence mechanisms. For such countries, the United Nations has to be the guarantor of rights, most especially those of sovereignty and self-determination. While it is clear that there have been major advances in the international political arena, as demonstrated by the end of the cold war, the growing respect for human rights and the progress of democracy, this is not the case in the economic arena, where considerable uncertainty still prevails. Despite the sacrifices and adjustments made by many developing countries and the opening up of their economies to trade a d investment flows, access of their goods and services to the principal markets is constantly being hindered by various new obstacles and barriers. The most vehement defenders of liberalised trade are engaged today in a major confrontation that is threatening the very stability of multilateralism and, in particular, the fate of the developing countries, whose interests are subordinated to the competition between the major economic blocs.\nThe Ministerial Declaration signed in Caracas by the Latin American Foreign Ministers at the Preparatory Meeting for the Eighth Conference on Trade and Development, refers with concern to the fact that those countries that are pressing most urgently for an open international system are precisely the ones that stray the farthest from the rules of the game by increasingly applying practices that distort international trade.\nFor example, the coffee industry is facing a drastic situation, owing to the lack of economic clauses in the International Coffee Agreement. Current price levels, in real terms, are the lowest they have been in the last 50 years; this has serious consequences for the economies of the coffee-producing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. In order to correct this difficult situation, this week the producer nations in London presented an emergency plan designed to put some order in the market; in this regard, Colombia has asked for the support and cooperation of the industrialised nations.\nColombia comes before the Assembly and into the international arena with new credentials. It is a country with a promising future, which has succeeded in facing the challenges of the present with honesty, transparency and boldness, making changes of major importance in its 100-year old National Constitution. The new Colombian Constitution, a reflection of the political will of the various sectors of public opinion, opens the institutional doors of the Republic in a democratic, civilised way so that new ideas regarding, political participation and citizens' rights can be introduced.\nThe new Colombia is encouraging young people to become involved in running the State. It has mechanisms to make the application of justice more flexible and expeditious. It generously extends to groups that have taken up arms the possibility of being honourably reintegrated into civilian life. The new Colombia seeks, both nationally and internationally, the redistribution of opportunity to individuals and nations so that we can all enjoy the fruits of growth and development and so that the gap between the haves and the have-nots will not continue to grow wider.\nIn the Bill of Rights that we have adopted, power rests with the individual. The State exists to serve the citizen, to protect him and to promote conditions that will enable all Colombians to develop freely. The Constitution enshrines a broad range of civil and political rights, safeguards social and economic rights, recognises group rights and establishes mechanisms to provide for their effective protection.\nWe see in this new Colombia arising from the efforts of President Cesar Gaviria - a young and bold leader who dared extend an early welcome to the future barely 13 months ago - an example of what can be achieved when there is a desire for consensus, the political will to attain it and generosity in handling complex situations.\nHe present these changes with pride and dignity and with the conviction that we have found the peaceful path on which new generations of Colombians shall travel, sowing along the way the seeds of a just, prosperous and equitable future. That is the new Colombia, which is now attending this General Assembly.\nIn addition, waves of change and renewal can be seen in Latin America and the Caribbean region. As regards peace, democratic participation, human rights and integration, our continent is moving forward at a rapid pace. Multilateralism has become a dominant force, as demonstrated by the various processes of association that are being carried out jointly and in parallel. It would be difficult to find a time of greater harmony and integration among the member countries of our region. The Rio Group, the Group of 3, the Cartagena Pact, the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and the strengthened efforts towards integration in Central America and the Caribbean region are a reflection of the processes of cooperation now under way. These are political, economic and cultural dialogues that are increasingly strengthening our roots, our experiences and our future, resulting in a firmer commitment among our nations to pool efforts in the joint action required to overcome obstacles that are common to us all and that we could not overcome individually. The negotiated solution reached by Argentina and Chile in their border dispute and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Guatemala and Belize are a reflection of the climate of political harmony and resolve in our region.\nAs regards the initiative for the Americas, Colombia welcomed it from the very moment of its promulgation as an ambitious plan for cooperation, and appreciated the multilateral character of some of its components. Consequently, Colombia hopes that Europe and Japan will Join with the United States so that the multilateral investment fund can become a reality in the immediate future.\nA united, future-oriented continent, which is capable of solving the basic needs of its people in peace, will be a source of support for United Rations efforts to achieve an open and integrated economic order.\nThis reference to our continent would be Incomplete if we did not mention the sense of obligation in our region to promote a rapprochement between the United States and Cuba. The same suspicions and mistrust that for so many years polarised relations among so many countries, and that led to the cold war that we all went through, now undermine the trust between these two Member States of the United Nations.\nWe are aware of the profound differences that separate them, but we believe that the new climate of peace and cooperation that has so swiftly suffused international relations could well serve as a basis for the frank and open discussion of unresolved matters. We hope that the winds of renewal and democratisation that are blowing throughout the world can be incorporated autonomously by Cuba into its political order. On the other hand, no one should underestimate the deep historical, geographic and cultural roots that unite Cuba with our region.\nThe changes that have occurred on the international scene since the creation of the United Nations, along with the appearance of new and complex problems, have emphasized, among the Member States of this Organization, the need to reflect on the most appropriate way to respond to the reality of today's world and on its future prospects. The new world scene demands a renewed United Nations. For this reason, the Rio Group has submitted for the consideration of all States certain guidelines as to our concept of the modernization of this Organization.\nWe believe that the process of revitalizing the United Nations ought not to be limited to simplifying and correcting its procedures or its operating patterns. The substantial increase in the Organization's membership, the new political realities and the new power structure in the world all call for a review of the existing criteria regarding the representation of the Member States at all levels of the system and their effective participation in the decision-making process. Achievement of these objectives would help to guarantee that the mandates issued are a clear and balanced reflection of the aspirations of the international community, and in particular those of the developing nations.\nIt is necessary to strengthen the General Assembly so that it can be a faithful interpreter of the will of the States. This must be the forum in which matters of global interest are debated and where efforts are made to promote an understanding of the importance of multisectoral action that will lead to successful international cooperation directed towards the social and economic growth and development of all peoples.\nJust as important as strengthening the General Assembly is the need to strengthen the office of the Secretary-General. This office must be provided with the instruments that will permit the independent exercise of its functions and the faithful attainment of the principles and objectives of the Organization.\nImproved coordination among United Nations agencies requires re-evaluation of the Security Council. It is necessary to give it a form in keeping with new realities and to study mechanisms to prevent excessive influence on the part of a few countries. Since 1945, Colombia has been opposed to the power of veto and believes that this is a good time to re-examine its advantageousness.\nMy country has urged that international relations be governed by International Law and by the principles of the United Nations Charter. We consider the work done by the International Court of Justice to be of vital importance. Today, more than aver, international cooperation is required to combat organised crime. President Cesar Gaviria has reiterated that the links in the chains of crime are reaching farther into all countries and that criminal groups are becoming true multinational organisations. Today's criminals pay no heed to nationalities or borders. The internationalization of crime must be opposed by the universalization of justice.\nCloser cooperation must be sought between judicial power and the authorities of the various States. Colombia is developing a strategy aimed at expediting the procedures for furnishing evidence and probative material requested by foreign authorities. Me believe it is the moral and legal obligation of all States to make available any evidence they have against criminals, particularly if these criminals are involved in crimes of multinational scope such as drug trafficking and terrorism. These actions must be reinforced by promoting legal mechanisms and programmes within the framework of the United Nations. One problem that is of great concern to my Government is that of arms dealing. Clearly, in order to reduce or limit arms dealing, as in any business, it will be necessary to reduce the demand as well as the supply. We believe that this is a most propitious moment to move ahead it this area.\nThe end of the cold war offers us a great opportunity to invest in development, using resources devoted to military expenditures. The \\\"peace dividend\\\" should be backed up by plans to switch over to civil production. In addition, efforts for disarmament should be complemented by measures to reduce the pressures that lead to arms production and exportation. The authorities of all our countries should commit themselves to giving priority to the establishment of effective control over the licit and illicit transfer of arms, especially when they are being sent to areas of conflict or to regions affected by the violence generated by criminal activity.\nThe international community must  recognise the consequences of poverty for world stability. For a number of years now, Colombia has pressed initiatives in various forums in the search for a solution that should be approached with the same sense of urgency that other crisis situations have aroused.\nPriority must be given on the international agenda to reactivating the economies of developing countries by opening up the markets of industrialized countries to their exports. This is the type of solidarity that we seek from the developed world.\nThe relaxing of tensions between the super-Powers has not put bread on the table of the poor. Neither poverty nor social injustice has been eliminated. On the contrary, for most countries, the conditions for development continue to be adverse: technology is beyond their grasp, the major markets for their products continue to be highly protected, and their status as debtors keeps them in the position of being net exporters of capital.\nColombia has offered to be the host country for the eighth United Rations Conference on Trade and Development (UHCTAD) in 1992. In order to ensure the success of the eighth UHCTAD, we must reformulate the criteria and mechanisms related to the economic and social development of our countries. It will be an opportunity to create new channels of communication between the North and the South around themes that have traditionally created controversy, but that we must now examine from the perspectives that currently characterize international dialogue. The backdrop for the meeting is the future functioning of the Organisation and the evolving negotiations of the Uruguay Round.\nThe eighth UNCTAD has to be the start of a new phase, of an era in which to take advantage of the opportunities that have opened up for International cooperation following the end of the East-West conflict successful restructuring of UNCTAD, based on cooperation between the various groups of countries that comprise it, would be a good precedent for the reforms that need to be made in the United Nations system.\nColombia looks forward with optimism to the forthcoming Conference on the Environment and Development which is to take place In June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. This \\\"Earth Summit\\\" will have to strengthen the mechanisms of international cooperation around this global theme. Neither the application of a model of rapacious development in the South nor the abandonment of economic growth is an option for solving the environmental crisis. Based on the joint responsibility of the nations of the North and of the South, it is necessary to open up possibilities for a model of sustainable development. The industrialized countries have to pay the ecological debt they have incurred with mankind.\nIn the field of human rights, the Organisation can justly claim that it has performed a successful task of universal scope. It is high time for the culture of human rights to become part of our civilisation.\nAdvances in democracy and progress in solving conflicts require conditions of development and social justice that allow the full play of economic, social and cultural rights. The World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 will therefore be one of the most important events of this decade.\nDespite the various national perspectives, we believe that a consensus is gradually building as to the kind of international environment that we must all promote and the contribution that all of us from the various regions and groups of countries can make to that new global context for peace and development. The developed countries must act with imagination and generosity to ensure that the developing countries have ample and sufficient resources to enable them to undertake the productive investments that they could not manage to make alone.\nThere is no better place than this to call for peace. The success the Salvadorian people and Government have achieved, with the support of the United Nations, is the best tribute to, and example of, Latin America's contribution to world peace.\nToday we have an unprecedented opportunity to face up with optimism to a new era for our Organization. We must jointly and severally accept this historic opportunity as authors of the promising future of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThere are times in the life of nations when circumstances arise that offer exceptional opportunities for strengthening peace and cooperation between peoples, opportunities for correcting past mistakes, for making up for the time wasted in conflicts, for realizing long-cherished desires.\nI believe, without exaggerated optimism, that we have begun passing through one of these stages. There are indeed many signs that this is the case. But of all of them, the most fundamental is the restoration of the dignity and freedom of the human being. That development has made it possible for history to change its course, with the result that we have today the extraordinary opportunity - and also the vast responsibility - of attempting to build a better world than the one we have known up until now.\nIt is from this that this newly opened forty-sixth session of the General Assembly derives its special importance. Accordingly, Mr. President, we welcome your election, which enables an experienced diplomat to steer our debates to a successful conclusion. The General Assembly has voted to admit seven new Members, thus raising the number of Members of the United Nations to 166 and simultaneously confirming the Organization's validity and universality. We greet the Democratic Republic of Korea, Estonia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Korea, and extend a most cordial welcome to them.\nThe formidable progress made by the cause of freedom in a few short but intense years has created conditions that will enable the United Nations, without sterile dissent, to comply fully with the stipulations of its basic Charter.\nChile and Latin America at large have also been a part of this process. The map of Latin American democracies, yesterday mutilated and obscured in various places by various forms of authoritarianism, now begins to conform to the outlines of a world seeking to establish a dialogue based on the common ideals of democracy and respect for human rights.\nAt this very moment the renewed democratic reality of our continent is feeing a crucial test in the form of the coup d'etat in Haiti. This constitutes an affront to the international community - which just a few days ago welcomed the President of Haiti on this very podium - and the most reprehensible type of attack on peace and security in our region. Yesterday the Organisation of American States set in motion the mechanisms agreed upon at its last general assembly to ensure the effectiveness of the Santiago Commitment to Democracy. The meeting of foreign ministers of States members of the OAS adopted measures to ensure the re-establishment of the legitimate Government in Haiti and sent a mission to that country. It expressed its willingness to take further steps, if necessary, to obtain this objective. We agreed without hesitation to the approval of these agreements.\nChile - which has known the suffering incurred by the breakdown of liberty - expresses its solidarity with the Haitian people and demands the respect for their free exercise of sovereignty as expressed in December of 1990 at the polls. Democracy must be re-established in Haiti.\nWe have seen that it is the values of democracy that have transformed an environment of confrontation into one of collaboration. These values have made it possible to put an end to conflicts that had dragged on for a long time and to make progress towards the solution of other as yet unresolved problems. They have achieved a start to the dismantling of the reprehensible apartheid regime, which we hope will soon disappear. Likewise, they have made possible the unequivocal and unanimous condemnation and halting of aggression perpetrated against a Member of the United Nations, thus discouraging the repetition of such acts in the future.\nWe agree with the statement in this year's report of the Secretary-General to the effect that: \\\"the end of the long season of stagnation for the United Nations\\\" (A/46/1, p. 2) has arrived. It is a reality recognised by all world leaders that the Organisation has gained in authority and prestige.\nIn large measure, this has been due to the effort, tenacity and creative imagination of its current Secretary-General. As the end of his term of office approaches, we should place it on record that Javier Peres de Cuellar has been an exemplary model for the standard of conduct recommended by the first President of the General Assembly to the Organisation's first Secretary-General: he has been firm without being intransigent, conciliatory without being weak, and impartial without exception. Almost half a century after its birth, the United Nations will have to be adapted to the challenges of the coming millennium. The present session will have to concentrate its efforts on such tasks. The far-reaching changes that have taken place on the world scene have, apart from moving beyond the former balance of power, changed the former concepts of security on which it was based. These changes now need to be reflected in the structures and procedures of the world Organization. They constitute capital which must be invested in bringing about significant progress in improving the mechanisms for peace, in negotiations for reaching substantive and balanced agreements on arms regulation, including the full and definitive prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction.\nIt is essential that the peace-keeping function entrusted to the United Nation by the San Francisco Charter should be fully discharged, in all forums, through multilateral action, and this should be a shared responsibility of all Member States. The experience of the Persian Gulf should lead to improvements in the means available to the Security Council for taking action with regard to the subjects within its competence and with regard to compliance with its resolutions.\nWe must recognise that peace is a commodity that is under constant threat on many fronts. This makes it advisable to welcome and support the timely and expeditious contributions that emerge in various ways and in various regions and subregions for preserving peace in those very places. In turn, the role of the Secretary-General during crises and in preventing conflicts needs to be strengthened. Chile is proud to add to its previous peace-keeping missions its current participation in the dedicated work of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) in the Persian Gulf and that of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).\nAbove all, peace means that the disturbing tensions which still confront mankind have to be faced. The temptation to resort to force, terrorism, drug trafficking, the arms trade, the oppression of tyrannies, violation of human rights and the poverty that prevails today in extensive regions of the world cannot but be constant sources of conflict and insecurity.\nIn the immediate future, we are confident that, through understanding and collaboration, the dramatic situation now prevailing in Yugoslavia will be resolved; and we also hope for a fruitful outcome to the negotiations to ensure that the International Peace Conference on the Middle East will lead to a just solution to unresolved issues in that area.\nThe same spirit of understanding and cooperation inspires President Aylwin's government and all the Latin American nations in their efforts to make our region one where peace and democracy prevail- The promising and unprecedented steps recently taken in this direction are the outcome of the profound adherence of Latin America's democracies to dialogue and the full validation of International law.\nIn this way, Chile and Argentina have offered the community of nations eloquent testimony to their peaceful and law-abiding will to resolve by mutual agreement the remaining border disputes between them - on one of the longest and most difficult frontiers in the world - by resorting, on the only point that could not be resolved directly, to the arbitration mechanism provided for in the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.\nThe conviction that all disputes can be resolved peacefully has made possible a strengthening of the climate of trust in the region. In the recent Mendoza Accord, which we signed jointly with Brazil and Argentina, later joined by Uruguay, we proclaimed our determination to eliminate from Latin America any possibility that chemical and biological weapons would be introduced. Such initiatives will have to be supplemented by the establishment of a broad nuclear-free zone when we succeed in ensuring that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America enters fully into force.\nIn the context of the positive steps aimed at neutralizing the risks of conflict in the continent, we received with profound joy and satisfaction the news of the agreements on El Salvador signed just a few days ago in this Organization, which us> r in the culminating phase of the pacification of Central America.\nIn Latin America today, active and concerted political efforts are under way to meet the challenges of a changing world. Despite the difficulties and limitations - and precisely with a view to overcoming them - cooperative agreements and mechanisms are multiplying in number. There is a growing awareness that peace and security can be consolidated only if we are capable of overcoming the diverse problems that conspire against the well-being and stability of our peoples.\nChile has committed itself to the task of making the promise of freedom and justice, which is inherent in democracy, a reality. This means bringing about growing levels of equity for our society, as well as effectively and coherently ensuring sustained and sustainable economic development.\nOur country has recently demonstrated its effective export potential and its firm resolve to pursue the practices of an open and dynamic economy in conformity with the currently prevailing trends.\nWe consider that, in the present circumstances, an economy which aspires to be up to date must be able both to compete in all spheres of trade and to meet the demands of complementarity within its own region.\nOn the basis of this premise, Chile has joined resolutely in the process of Latin American integration within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association, employing a flexible approach which ties in with other encouraging formulas now current in the region.\nWe have concluded important agreements on economic issues with Argentina. We have just signed a highly important agreement with Mexico - the first of its kind in Latin America - which, after a brief period of progressive reduction of duties, will bring about freedom of trade between the two nations. We are developing similar arrangements with other countries of the region, namely, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia, with which we have already made significant progress.\nIn a world in which the trend towards globalisation is daily becoming more marked, we believe that regional integration and openness to the world, far from being in conflict, are converging approaches which cannot fail to optimize and strengthen the potential of our economy. In this sense, we have positively appraised President Bush's Americas Initiative and are fully ready to continue making progress towards the implementation of its provisions. Similarly, we are seeking to strengthen our links with Europe and with the Pacific nations, which are already important.\nInteraction between different regions, rather than confinement within them, must be viewed as vital to the economic progress of mankind. Therefore, for the present, the expansion of world trade, the growing flow of investment and the transfer of technologies cannot be exclusive privileges of the industrialised countries. Rather, their salutary and beneficial effects should be extended to all regions and countries. It would be particularly discouraging if the collapse of ideological walls were to be succeeded by the erection of economic walls blocking the developing world's aspiration to become integrated into the international economy.\nWe are concerned, therefore, that in contrast to the signs of opening up and liberalisation, and in violation of basic norms of equity and reciprocity, protectionist positions continue to be reiterated, such as those which to date have made the Uruguay Bound of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) unproductive and that-, drastically affect the ability of the nations that have fallen farthest behind to offer better living standards for their peoples. The time has come for the new focus on the human being that has become evident in the political sphere to be reflected likewise in the humanization of the economy.\nIn this connection, Chile is following with interest the proposals for reform that have been made with respect to the Economic and Social Council in an effort to systematize and coordinate its functions, rationalize its resources and strengthen the topics of development and technical cooperation. This process should help link the Council more effectively with other international economic and financial organisations.\nThe political progress made by the international community in recent years has not been accompanied by a similar process in the field of social development. The \\\"social cost\\\" of political change and economic adjustment has led to an alarming deterioration in the standards and quality of life in many parts of the world, particularly in the developing countries.\nIt is in these countries that the crisis in social conditions is having its most acute and devastating effects, exacerbated by the harmful impact of environmental degradation, which is today attaining truly intolerable proportions. All this has led not only to their continued stagnation but even to an open deterioration of their development prospects, while at the same time constantly counteracting the efforts at modernisation that are gaining some ground in these nations. This affects in particular the countries of Africa, which need special attention from the international community.\nBut this situation is not restricted to the developing world. Its effects and consequences extend, infiltrate, and bring pressure to bear on the industrialized societies as well, introducing increasingly disruptive elements.\nTherefore, it is imperative that international development cooperation be recognized as vital to world security, and that all nations must be a part of it. Just. as the international community has begun to be aware of environmental problems - and the forthcoming International Conference on Environment and Development is an encouraging sign of this - it must tackle social problems with equal resolve. For these purposes, there is no multilateral forum other than the United Nations system. That is why the Government of Chile strongly supports the holding of a world summit meeting for social development, the careful preparation of which should take place at the highest possible level, in a world-wide consensus to step up multisectoral development cooperation and strengthen security in its twin aspects of the individual and society.\nThe dignity of the human being and the application and improvement of democracy must be the ultimate objective and central concern of all nations. It is democratic systems, despite their imperfections, which afford the best guarantees of respect for the human being and which most effectively promote healthy international coexistence.\nA major contribution would be made to this objective if democratic governments themselves were to invite observers from the United Nations or regional organisations to be present during their electoral processes. In this way, this practice would become universal in other regions, rendering obsolete the argument that it constitutes a threat to sovereignty.\nThe Secretary-General reflects our view fully when he states in his report on the work of the Organisation:\n\\\"... the principle of non-interference with the essential domestic jurisdiction of States cannot be regarded as a protective barrier behind which human rights could be ... violated with impunity.\\\" To accept this false argument would run counter to the basic rule of all coexistence and betray the hopes of those who are victims of totalitarian systems and powerless to defend themselves. It is to them, and not to their persecutors, that we owe our loyalty. Solidarity is on the side of democracy and condemns those who violate it.\nAccordingly, President Aylwin's Government - which has assumed an irrevocable moral commitment to the defence of these rights - will work untiringly, transcending frontiers and ideologies, to strengthen the mechanisms that protect democracies and, ultimately, the fundamental values of the human being. Accordingly, we attach special importance to the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for 1993.\nThe last decade of this surprising century has opened up unsuspected possibilities for the international community - and also great uncertainties. It is for the nations assembled here, and for the Organisation that brings them together, to know how to take advantage of the former and dispel the latter.\nBut as important as the security of States, or more important, are the security and integrity of individuals. It is in relation to these, in the final analysis, that the tasks that are set and the actions taken must find their meaning.\nLarge numbers of human beings continue to live an existence clouded by all kinds of deprivations and threats. We cannot put off meeting their demands and their hopes, or disappoint them. They express fundamental and constant values of mankind which we all see as our own.\nWe have an opportunity such as we have perhaps never had before of ensuring that those values begin to prevail once and for all. Achieving this will mean giving back to large numbers of persons their dignity and freedom so that they can shape for themselves the course of the history they wish to live.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Seychelles wishes to extend its congratulations to the President on his unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at this session. We should also like to extend a welcome to the seven new States Members of the Organisation. We take this opportunity too to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who has played a decisive role in strengthening the Organisation throughout this decade, undoubtedly the most significant decade of the last part of the century. We congratulate him on the timely and judicious initiatives he has constantly taken to make the Organization so credible and so effective.\nSince our last meeting here the world has witnessed a number of events that today cause us to have a considerably altered view of international relations. Notwithstanding some persistent hotbeds of tension, the new factors militate in favour of dialogue rather than tests of strength. We see the emergence of an approach based on the notion of consensus which relies on negotiation. We must now learn to talk to each other, to listen to each other in a word, to use a common language and to make more use than ever before of an effective and generally recognized tool of mediation.\nThat tool exists today. Over the past months the United Nations has proved that it is not only useful but indispensable. Given the backing and the means for intervention by all nations, the United Nations has finally become the primary institution for management of world law and order. Does this now mean that our appeals repeated year after year in this very Hall have been heeded? It is very comforting for a great many countries to know that their cause will henceforth be heard and defended with the same degree of impartiality and diligence.\nThat is why the Seychelles joins all other countries in stating and attesting to its confidence in this Institution and in asking that it be given increased powers. I have in mind particularly the role the United Nations should play in Imposing strict control over arms sales of all kinds. I also believe that no effort should be spared in supporting the actions undertaken by the United Nations to solve and prevent conflicts wherever they may arise. Similarly, all initiatives designed to promote and defend human rights, all actions designed to ease or systematically eliminate debt and to strengthen structures for cooperation and development of all kinds must be supported by us all, both in word and indeed.\nHowever, this determinedly optimistic overall vision of world management includes the notion of broad-based consultations in which all voices will have an equal importance. On the threshold of the emergence of a new order, a complete embodiment of the San Francisco Charter, we must define now the roles that each of us is called upon to play. For it is obvious that a certain disparity remains between the poles of decision, and in this transitional period from one order to another, we must join it. giving thought to producing a universally agreed-upon notion of the emerging new world order.\nOf course, all sides have come up with broad principles. They are all intended to be the faithful reflection of the aspirations of peoples, large and small, for a lasting system of international peace, security for mankind and stability for States, without which there can be neither peace nor development. He must also determine what part each will play in the new distribution of responsibilities.\nFor many of us the establishment, of this new order means that we must abandon, at least for the time being, the strictly economic and political benchmarks advocated by the previous order in favour of more lasting criteria connected with quality of life and a healthy environment.\nWe are in complete agreement on that point. However, a new order on a global level entails structural changes, often of a basic nature. It also calls for a change in thinking, a new kind of human behaviour, solidarity free from ethnocentricity, without, of course, prejudicing national cultures and identities. It requires a great deal of effort, time and resources. Thus, my question is have we the necessary resources that our ambitions for renovation require?\nThe political and socio-economic changes that must necessarily occur cannot be effected overnight. They demand that suitable democratic institutions be set up and made workable, and they therefore demand time. Above all, they demand that countries be totally sovereign. By that, I mean that they must have a real choice of political and economic options and that, consequently, they must once and for all be freed from the traps of dependency in which they have all too often - often involuntarily - been caught.\nNo one escapes history, fashions, trends or even Utopias, and since current thinking is in the direction of political pluralism, let us dwell on that. The gathering power of this idea is reflected by a vast reform movement in relationships among nations. But so far there is no predetermined mould in which we can harmonise all political tendencies.\nIn the current historical context it is clear that very often countries have to pass through forms of government adapted to the needs of the moment. Everyone agrees, however, in recognising that the choices and their consequences can be very different from one country to another, that it is unrealistic to fail to take account of the implicit and inevitable factors leading to this or that option. In any case, people dislike seeing their Governments subject to external pressure of any kind. We therefore suggest that, in the establishment of the new system of relationships among States, account be taken of the need and the right of every State to evolve at its own pace and not according to another pace imposed from the outside.\nThat leads me to turn to the tendentious practice of tying public assistance for development to political demands. If conditional aid can be justified by the need to undertake certain structural adjustments, it is not, however, honest for the stick-and-carrot method to be used to compel Governments to undertake immediate changes with motives that are not always clear vis-\u00e0-vis the well-being of their peoples.\nIn this context, while it might be appropriate in some manner or other to exert influence on certain political tendencies that are not in keeping with the well-being of man or with the process of development overall, it would be preferable by far to help Governments invest more of themselves rather than to impose arbitrary and radical methods. A case-by-case analysis of the\nparticular constraints inherent in each country and the search for solutions better adapted to the needs expressed would be a more fitting response towards implementation of the strategies that are required.\nThe climate of confidence which now seems to prevail among States is itself a response to the interdependence and globalisation of the world economy. But, although the current trend is linked to the strengthening of international cooperation in a spirit of equitable partnership, we see that in fact the same relationships of force and inequality prevail. They will continue to prevail until the new criteria for development come to be respected and applied with the necessary care and judiciousness.\nThat is just a matter of common sense; nevertheless we must note that in spite of the apparent progress in North-South cooperation efforts, concrete exchanges still remain disproportionate. That is why it is essential to formulate at once a lasting strategy for international development capable of universal application as a matter of urgency. New factors favourable to exchanges are discernible today, and it is up to us to take advantage of them.\nEast-West tensions are now a thing of the past; and ideological antagonisms have been dismantled. There is only one constraining dimension left to take into account. This, of course, is the overall inequality between the North and the South, and for the latter the notion of dependence still overrides the concept which has been much proclaimed, namely, interdependence.\nTrue, with the advent of the new expanded North, new prospects for partnership have opened up in the field of cooperation. It is no doubt here that North-South cooperation can be launched and new solutions found to break the deadlock in which the third world countries find themselves.\nHowever, In this future of \\\"logical partnership\\\" where competition dominates, there are signs that new losers will emerge if we fail to define right now the sharing of responsibilities at all levels. Development in which everyone participates must be based on the conviction that economic development should no longer take place at the expense of the environment. On behalf of all countries, such as my own, with scant human resources and practically no natural resources, on behalf of all the countries whose economies are extremely vulnerable to external turmoil, we therefore seek a general mobilisation to preserve this resource, this invaluable capital which is the world ecological heritage.\nIn this context, we hope that the Conference on Environment and Development, to be held next year, will have the necessary authority to decide on the appropriate means of managing this resource.\nWe hope that at that time those countries I shall call the \\\"museums of the world\\\" will be given the necessary means to enable their populations to attain social and economic well-being without nature suffering as a consequence. The Seychelles calls upon all those who would defend the environment to see to it that international cooperation in this new dimension of development is strengthened in a tangible way.\nWithin this movement which has broken with the past but which in enhancing the value of what has been achieved is preparing for the future, let us pool our efforts. At the dawn of the establishment of a more equitable world where greater solidarity reigns, let us have the courage of our ambitions so that man and nature can really be at the heart of development. May our speeches no longer remain dead letters or be confined to the realm of parody, but at lest provide the needed impulse for action.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the free people and the Government of Lithuania, I extend to Mr. Samii Shihabi sincere congratulations on his election to the office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session and I hope that his work will be crowned with success. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, on his efforts at enhancing the role and prestige of the United Nations and his contribution in promoting world peace and understanding among nations.\nLithuania also wishes to express its gratitude to the many Governments that have helped us to make our way back to independence an easier one. In our country's time of greatest need, there were Governments that stood with our people as they sought to regain their rightful place in the international community. In particular, I would like to recognize the friendly hand extended to us by the peoples of Iceland and our other Nordic neighbours. In my country they shall for ever be remembered for their courage and perseverance on our behalf.\nThe people of Lithuania join with the peoples of Estonia and Latvia in rejoicing on their admission to this world body. Two years ago, we linked hands with our Baltic brothers and sisters in a human chain stretching 600 kilometres from Vilnius to Riga to Tallinn. On that day the people of our three countries knew in their hearts that the trust forged In hardship among us would lead us out of bondage together. While we are admitted to the United Nations as three, we celebrate as one.\nI have been assigned by my Government to speak for a country that has just emerged from the dark night of oppression, blinded at first by the sudden light of freedom. Our people are elated and happy to join the family of sovereign nations. We are well aware that the first steps will be difficult, but we are happy to have this opportunity to show that a free people can achieve moral and material well-being even under the most adverse conditions.\nLithuania is a centuries-old nation that has always endeavoured to live at peace in a region of the world often fought over by our larger neighbours. Situated at a European crossroads, the Lithuanian people established their own State in the thirteenth century. King Gediminas, who in the fourteenth century reigned over a land that was home to Lithuanians, Byelorussians, Ukrainians, Jews and other nationalities, promoted the principles of tolerance and mutual respect among citizens. For the next five centuries, the descendants of Gediminas would foster and build upon these proud traditions, making them the cornerstone of the Lithuanian State.\nWhile Lithuania eventually fell victim to the expansionist policies of its larger neighbours and in the late eighteenth century was partitioned between them, its people continued to strive for independence, never submitting to ruthless attempts to destroy their treasured traditions. With national awakening sweeping the captive nations of Eastern Europe, Lithuania was reborn on 16 February 1918, after 123 years of foreign rule. The Republic of Lithuania was proclaimed a democratic and independent State, and the enlightened founding fathers drew strength from the traditions of the previous Lithuanian State in fostering tolerance between religions and respect for the cultural identity of national minorities.\nLithuania was a full-fledged and active member of the League of Nations. The Republic of Lithuania provided shelter and security for its people and established cultural, economic, and political ties with nations around the world. Peoples of all nationalities, offered the chance to live in peace and prosperity in the Republic of Lithuania, nurtured their cultures and traditions.\nYet, in 1940, all of this was swept away with the stroke of a pen. One year earlier the fate of the peoples of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia was decided in secret by two brutal dictators who represented two ruthless totalitarian systems. One year later, with Europe in the chaos of war, these three countries were quickly and silently erased from the world map. Hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings were lost to Nazi and Stalinist terror, and the hands of the clock of progress stopped. \nIn the years that followed, our people vigorously resisted foreign rule. For nine years after the Second World War a guerrilla war raged in Lithuania's forests while Lithuanian freedom fighters were sacrificing their lives to resist foreign occupation of our country. After the guerrilla war the Lithuanian people engaged in a protracted non-violent struggle to preserve their national identity. While they were forced to bury history hooks and hide any remembrance of our independent past, parents never stopped quietly telling their children of more joyous days, and these children would tell their children.\nAnd around the world Lithuanians, forced to leave their homeland for fear of deportation and imprisonment, ceaselessly laboured to prevent the complete disappearance of our nation's name from modern memory. Western democracies refused to recognize the illegal incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union and kept alive our hope that the day would soon come when Lithuania would return to the world.\nIn 1988 Lithuania was again reborn. In one fateful summer, in the shadow of thousands of Lithuanian flags, we found our voice, and sang, arm in arm, as tanks rolled by us. We raised no hand, and fired no bullets, for all of us knew to be true the words expressed in a poem by the Lithuanian poet Maironis written decades earlier during the first Lithuanian rebirth:\n\\\"You cannot stop the flow of the river,\n\\\"You cannot halt the new rebirth\\\".\nOn 11 March 1990 the freely elected Supreme Council proclaimed the restoration of Lithuania's independence, and during the plebiscite on 9 February this year the people overwhelmingly confirmed that Lithuania is, and shall remain, an independent, democratic Republic. We wish to express our sincere appreciation to observers from many countries who came to Lithuania and were able to report on the validity of the elections to the Supreme Council and on the plebiscite on independence.\nLess than 10 months ago, on 13 January, peaceful and unarmed Lithuanian civilians defended their liberty and their legitimate Government by gathering in their thousands outside the Parliament building and pledging never to retreat. That night, as the words of Lithuanian folk songs sung around bonfires drowned out the thunder of Soviet tank fire, peaceful resistance triumphed, but not without tragic loss. Before the smoke cleared the next morning and the Soviet attempt to overthrow our democratically elected Government had failed, 13 of Lithuania's bravest men and women had died and hundreds more had been injured in the name of our independence.\nOur people's devotion to liberty and their peaceful efforts to defend their freedom have already proved a model to other nations. The disintegration of Soviet Communist power started in the occupied Baltic nations, since they were the first nations ruled by the Soviet Union to dare to protest openly and then to rebel against an oppressive, ruthless and arrogant totalitarian regime. Two months ago the spirit of peaceful but resolute resistance to dictatorship manifested itself in Moscow, as Russians defended their Parliament and the future of democracy. The message was the same: the thirst for freedom will conquer all obstacles.\nBut freedom is never easy, and it will not be so for us. We are all well aware of the difficulties confronting us. Our national economy is entering an intense period of reconstruction and reorganization after years of central planning and neglect. My Government is committed to providing its people with the security and prosperity only a free market can provide. Yet privatization, price reform, introduction of our own convertible currency, reorientation of industry and the establishment of a sound environment for the conduct of free trade require great patience. As the experience of other Eastern European countries has shown, the transition from a command to a market economy is impossible without the support and active assistance of developed nations. Therefore, Lithuania looks forward to the advice and assistance of the United Nations family of agencies.\nAs our world grows smaller and our awareness of our collective responsibility for its future increases, our efforts to protect what is truly one country, our planet, must be intensified. Lithuania now endures the terrible consequences of careless development and disregard for the environment. Pollution levels and waste residue are reaching alarming levels in my country. In recent years various pollutants have tainted our dairy and farm products. And not a hundred miles from Lithuania's capital there stands a monument to the utter disregard of previous Governments for human safety - the Ignalina nuclear power station. While the plant supplements energy supplies for a large portion of the Baltic region, safety considerations and waste disposal have not been given the attention they demand. It is my hope that the lessons we are now learning as a result of the tragic consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe, which also greatly affected my country, will underscore the frailty of our common home and encourage us to seek universal guidelines for environmental protection.\nOur country has over the past year been actively engaged in regional discussions on the clean-up of the Baltic Sea. Like many similar efforts taking place in other areas of the world, these multilateral consultations now lay the groundwork for an increase in coordinated efforts by the international community as a whole.\nWe are hopeful that the world economy and environment issues will improve through constructive dialogue within the framework of the United Nations system. He look forward to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, scheduled to be held in Brazil in June next year, aimed at laying the groundwork for international accord and cooperation on these pivotal issues.\nMany who have addressed the Assembly before me have pointed to the new and truly wonderful opportunity offered the world community to bring a swift and lasting end to global tensions. In recent years the long-awaited chance for peace has come to regions previously suffering from constant conflict. We hope that from the Middle East to Asia, Central America and, yes, the Baltic States, nations will soon be free from the threat of violence and will be able, many for the first time in their modern history, to address pressing economic, environmental and social concerns. We are for the peaceful, non-violent realization of the self-determination of nations, and in this regard Lithuania, which won its independence through peaceful means, subscribes fully to the provisions of the United Nations Charter calling for the settlement of disputes through dialogue and mutual understanding. Lithuania has no quarrels with any of its neighbours, wanting only to live in peace with all of them.\nIt is with this end in mind that my Government has called for the removal of all Soviet troops from our soil. Their presence in Lithuania is utterly illegal; it is not based on any treaty or agreement and Lithuania's Government refuses to agree to their continued presence in our country. With the withdrawal of these armed forces not only will Lithuania be free to strengthen the institutions of its new democracy, but the soldiers, so long the instruments of faceless generals miles away, may return to their homes and participate in the historic opportunity to rebuild their nations devastated by 70 years of neglect.\nLithuania is very much concerned about the danger of proliferation of nuclear armaments in the world. We welcome the proposals for a large scale reduction of nuclear arms put forward by the President of the United States and the President of the Soviet Union. However, we are worried about the spread of such armaments to many other countries. The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania has already voted to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Lithuania does not have any such armaments and refuses to acquire them in the future. Lithuania's Government hopes that the Soviet forces in Lithuania have no nuclear weapons in their possession. Should that not be the case, Lithuania demands their immediate removal from its territory. Furthermore, Lithuania actively supports the establishment of a nuclear-arms-free zone extending from the Nordic countries in the north to the Black Sea in the south.\nI should now like to turn to a subject held most dear by the people of Lithuania: human rights. Lithuania has welcomed and will continue to welcome the internationalization of human-rights monitoring. The rights of men, women and children transcend all boundaries. Lithuania is building a multiparty, democratic State which will protect the rights and freedoms of all its citizens. Lithuania's laws protect the cultural rights of all national minorities with the aim of enriching our country's cultural heritage. Lithuania adds its voice the many voices calling for greater international coordination in responding to crises around the globe. As a nation which has sought the understanding, and through this the support, of the international community for its goals, we fully appreciate the need for swift response to prevent the aggravation of conflicts that threaten international peace.\nThe idea of a new world order, of which so many have spoken, is an idea that gives real hope to nations and peoples tired of old tyrannies and distrustful of old rhetoric. It is the hope of my Government that this order will be based, not as past orders have been, on power politics, but on respect for human rights, dignity and self-determination.\nAs President Landsbergis told this Assembly only last month, Lithuania wishes to see the old cynicism connected with politics rejected and hopes to see substituted for it a faith in progress based on higher values and on respect for individual human dignity. As Mr. Landsbergis stated:\n\\\"if one person can lead a moral life, why cannot moral politics govern the world? If one can speak the truth, why cannot open truth govern politics?\\\" (A/46/py.l, pp. 82-83)\nIn closing, I should like to express once again our country's joy at the warm welcome we have received from this world body and people everywhere. He eagerly await the opportunity to join in the establishment of a secure future for all our children and look forward to many years of constructive cooperation in the United Nations, on which the hopes of humanity for a peaceful and just world order are based.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt a stage of unprecedented significance for the international system, I should like to congratulate Mr. Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. The renaissance of the United Nations is a stimulating challenge that we must undertake in a creative spirit if we are to enter the twenty-first century with a world body capable of responding efficiently to the increasing demands of today's world.\nA clear symptom of the period of transformation that we are experiencing is the incorporation of States whose membership of this Organization would have seemed inconceivable only a few years ago. The admission of the Republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia represents the rescue, affirmation and historic reparation of the principle of peoples' right to self-determination. The full membership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and of the Republic of Korea symbolizes the removal of the anachronism of the ideological factor in international relations, as well as recognition of the need to face issues from a practical perspective by overcoming traditional confrontations. Likewise, the admission of the Marshall Islands and of the Federated States of Micronesia reaffirms the universal character of our Organisation.\nSeldom in recent history hive mankind's opportunities consciously to build its future been affirmed so clearly. The irrelevance of ideology in international affairs has offered a wide margin of freedom to create, to innovate, to establish principles and criteria that reflect the concerns and needs of all peoples. At the same time, however, it has sown the seeds of great uncertainty.\nThere has been an increasing concentration of power on a worldwide scale, with the possibility of its consolidation as a unipolar system.\nThe globalization of the international economy constitutes a parallel stream, which calls into question the narrowness of productive forces restricted to national contexts. This calls for a reshaping of commercial blocs and a restructuring of economies, based on regional criteria. Thus, the interrelationships of political, economic and social factors in the international community are today more evident than ever.\nIn this context, the North-South relationship becomes all the more complex with the emergence of global issues, such as narco-terrorism, the sustainable protection of the environment, human rights, and other issues that, by their very nature, demand a more imaginative approach.\nAt such a complex juncture what is the role of the United Nations? We face an international climate of an unprecedented nature which provides us with the opportunity to shape our own future. The United Nations, as the highest forum of the system and as the only truly universal body, must play an essential role in the management of the international system at this time of great fluidity. To this end, it is imperative to maintain the balance among its organs and to strengthen the political role of the Secretary-General, in order to avert a monopoly in the handling of multilateral affairs as a result of the concentration of power within the Security Council.\nOne of the clearest signs of the need for the United Nations to adapt to the new international reality is the intense practice of dialogue and consensus. Towards this objective, my country, and Latin America at large, are -filling actively to participate in the strengthening of diplomacy and the operative restructuring of the United Nations, by enhancing our own regional mechanisms for agreement.\nIn the same vein Peru hopes to contribute to making the Non-Aligned Movement a key protagonist in the dialogue with developed countries in order to define a new model of international relationships taking into account the just aspirations of all members.\nIn this new context my country welcomes the steps taken by the Secretary-General which have helped the people of El Salvador to envisage a peaceful future after long years of suffering. The action of the United Nat ions has also enabled the people of Western Sahara to decide on their own future and has opened a promising path to the definitive solution of the Cambodian conflict.\nWe cannot lose sight of the fact that the impressive changes to which we have referred have taken place against a backdrop characterised by the persistence of, and in many cases the worsening of, poverty levels in vast sectors of the world population. The redefinition of international cooperation for development must, therefore, be the new central item on the multilateral agenda.\nIt is thus indispensable to elaborate a broader approach to such cooperation, placing special emphasis on countries that, like those in Latin America, are now engaged in a sustainable development process based upon their own efforts.\nInternational cooperation should be the expression of the commitment of the international community to create an economic international climate conducive to development. It must, therefore, not be conceived as an exercise in paternalism or charity.\nTo the degree that international security is today determined by elements beyond considerations of a mere military and strategic nature, these affect the internal stability of States and are closely related to social and economic challenges. Therefore, they should become decisive factors in the magnitude of the flow of international cooperation.\nIt. must also be noted that the existence of highly destabilizing factors in emerging democracies, such as terrorism and drug trafficking, make it necessary to re-examine the social concepts which have guided the action of the United Nations.\nThis new approach must assess whether action taken in the social field has, to some degree, laid the foundations for the political stability of States, particularly the developing countries.\nFor this reason and with the same keen interest and dedication currently applied to negotiations on global issues, a new and enhanced approach to social issues must be taken within the United Nations. Peru considers this to be one of the key elements in the process of renewal that now inspires the work of the United Nations.\nIn order to attain this objective, Peru considers one of the most appropriate possibilities to be the convening of a world summit for social development and this goal must be reached through substantive work, the main characteristic of which must be the frank and open exchange of views based on realities rather than on purely academic considerations.\nToday's multilateral agenda encompasses a new set of problems generically called \\\"global issues\\\", that includes questions that link the developed world with the developing countries.\nTherefore, and in order to make the handling of these issues truly effective, it is necessary to include the developmental component in whatever international commitments are undertaken. In this manner, a new North-South dialogue, characterized by agreement rather than by confrontation, can be achieved. Such a dialogue must be based on the following three guidelines: first, the dialogue must be fundamentally of a social and economic nature; secondly, the development variable muse be included in this new generation of international issues, such as the environment, narco-terrorism and the growth of a dynamic entrepreneurship for a free, just and equitable economy; and, thirdly, the new international agenda must react to those initiatives that stem from civil society as well as from governments.\nInterdependence has produced an increasing indivisibility between the internal affairs of countries and their external environment. Peru is perhaps a model case of such a relationship. My country has made and continues to make enormous efforts to develop a new relationship with the international system,\nAfter one year of implementing a rational economic programme and the launching of a plan of structural reform designed to adapt the country to new world realities in the midst of hardships accumulated over a long period, democracy has reaffirmed itself in my country. We have successfully controlled hyper-inflation, we have started again to meet our financial obligations and have been readmitted into the international financial community. We are committed to limiting and eliminating non-productive spending. We have visibly improved the human rights situation, and have intensified our frontal attack against drug trafficking.\nThe most serious questions on the agenda of this session of the Assembly are present in Peru. For this reason Peru can be considered as a characteristic and special case in the new international cooperation which should be promoted by the United Nations system.\nThe Peruvian people, with an exemplary spirit of sacrifice, has set in action a process of national renovation that should deserve the recognition and support of the international community. I wish to acknowledge here the generous cooperation received during the first year President Fujimori's administration. He are confident that this cooperation will be expanded and deepened, especially in the coming two years, as this will be crucial for the consolidation of the Peruvian economic programme.\nThis represents the culmination of a long process in which international cooperation has played a fundamental role. A support group, composed of the United States, Japan, Canada and European and Latin American countries and providing generous cooperation, has recently been established. They are giving their generous assistance to enable my country to raise the necessary funds to meet our arrears to multilateral financial institutions. The normalisation of our relations with these institutions has facilitated the reintegration of Peru into the international financial community.\nMy Government has also endeavoured to establish a new investment policy with a law which ensures secure and favoured treatment for foreign capital. Likewise, it has laid down norms to facilitate the admission of foreigners who wish to channel capital to Peru. Furthermore, a law on private investment in public enterprises, aimed at achieving an effective alliance between the public and the private sectors, has been adopted.\nThe results of our economic policy must also be tolerable for society. The people of Peru are not poor, they have become impoverished. This is a people that has been consistently hard-working and historically master of its own destiny. Peruvians do not deserve a bleak future of continual adversity; this is why we urgently need tangible achievements in the social sphere.\nTherefore, in honouring the strong commitment made at the World Summit for Children in September, 1990, Peru was the first country to put forward a comprehensive plan in favour of the child, and it is now time to implement that plan. This is why the participation of the international community is indispensable. It is our hope that we will be granted, on the basis of our own efforts, specific resources to complement the measures now being taken by the Government of Peru to protect the future of our children.\nThe criminal action of drug trafficking associated with terrorism has had profound and adverse effects on my country. To deal successfully with this situation, the President of Peru, in October, 1990, made public an initiative which includes an integrated policy of drug control and coca substitution.\nTraditionally, as a part of the Andean way of life, the coca leaf has been cultivated in Peru. However, nowadays its production has been distorted by the external stimulus of the indiscriminate international consumption of one of its derivatives, cocaine. This is an objective fact that clearly confirms that the Peruvian peasants engaged in the cultivation of coca cannot, under any circumstances, be considered as drug traffickers. Moreover, differentiating them from traffickers might provide the key for a comprehensive treatment of the problem.\nToday, 60 per cent of the coca leaf is produced in Peru and 80 per cent of the illegal production of cocaine is consumed in the United States. Therefore, the understanding that exists between the Governments of the United States and Peru on cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking is of crucial importance to Peru, to the United States and to the international community at large. The Government of Peru, together with the international community, has the most resolute political will to eradicate drug trafficking\nIn this context, on 14 May 1991, the Governments of Peru and of the United States signed an agreement on drug control and on alternative development policy. This document contains essential elements for the Peruvian policy on drugs, such as the recognition by both parties of the failure of the exclusively repressive measures hitherto employed, and of the causal relationship between consumption and production of drugs.\nRegarding the innovative role the United Nations must play in this field, Peru offers its resolute support to the new international drug control programme of action and commends Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli on his work as head of the programme. The issue of the environment is also one of high priority to the Peruvian Government. He are confident that the international community will reach balanced agreements to prevent the preservation of the environment from becoming a new conditionality for the development of our countries. This requires innovative efforts in the field of international cooperation in order to make available additional financial resources and to ensure the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to the developing world on preferential and non-commercial terns.\nIn this effort, a country's sovereign right to manage its own natural resources should be upheld, as should the principle that those who most contribute to environmental degradation should be held most responsible. The mechanisms which may be devised should include debt relief schemes.\nAnother serious problem Peru is confronting is that of terrorism. My country suffers from the scourge o\u00a3 one of the most cruel terrorist groups in the world. Their criminal actions over the past 11 years have meant the loss of more than 22,000 human lives end have resulted in economic losses equivalent to 90 per cent of our GDP.\nDemocracy is Peru, by free election and encompassing all political parties and ideologies, is prevailing and will prevail over the scourge of terrorism financed by drug trafficking. He are acting transparently, openly and legally, in order to enforce human rights effectively and fully in the amidst of the conflict with the democratic system and against fundamental freedoms which terrorism initiated more than a decade ago.\nThis is what is really happening in Peru. For us it is essential that Governments, the United Stations, private organizations and everyone committed to the defence of human rights assist us in telling the world and explaining to it that terrorism is the main source of violence.\nWe cannot tolerate the persistence of unbalanced, distorted and even conspiratorial Information that tries to justify the criminal actions of terrorism against our people, our society and its institutions. The Government of Peru has noticeably improved the situation of human rights through practical measures that are transparent and legal. It is convinced that the fight against violence must be carried out with respect for human rights, for that is precisely the foundation of the legitimacy of its actions against the crimes perpetrated by narco-terrorists and violent groups that consider human rights bourgeois rights that should be eliminated.\nMy country has established the Council for Peace in order to ensure the strict observance of human rights, complementing it with a legislative decree authorising criminal prosecutors in zones declared to be in a state of emergency to enter police and military compounds and any other place of detention in order to verify the situation of persons under arrest and of those reported as missing.\nAs I have previously pointed out, international security in the post-cold-war era is inextricably associated with the need for a new approach to socio-economic matters. Without greater progress in this field, international security will continue to be seriously threatened.\nIn the same vein, President Fujimori, at the First Ibero-American summit, held in Mexico in July 1991, proposed an initiative for regional disarmament based upon the renunciation of the use of arms of mass destruction and the utilization of the resources thus made available to promote economic and social development in Latin America.\nThe peace-loving attitude Peru in reflected in its permanent commitment to regional disarmament as an effective measure for general and complete disarmament; in its active participation within the framework of negotiations, currently being carried out in Geneva, for the establishment of an international convention on chemical weapons; in its reaffirmation of the terms of the international convention on bacteriological weapons; in its role as promoter of the initiative for a complete ban on nuclear testing; and in our peace-loving efforts to make the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty an effective instrument for cooperation and universal understanding.\nThe President of Ecuador, Mr. Rodrigo Borja, during his address delivered yesterday, 30 September 1991, stated that Ecuador has an unsolved territorial problem with Peru which endangers peace in the region. He has proposed the arbitration of His Holiness Pope John Paul II as a means of resolution. In this regard, with all due respect and admiration for His Holiness, we find ourselves in the imperative need to firmly put forward two rectifications:\nFirstly, the President of Ecuador has attempted to ignore in his statement the very existence of the Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries of Rio de Janeiro of 1942, which definitively settled the boundary problem existing between Ecuador and Peru. Ecuador cannot disavow this treaty, duly signed, approved by the respective congresses, and ratified by both countries, under the solemn guarantee of four other American Republics that also signed it as guarantors: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America.\nHence, there is no territorial problem between Peru and Ecuador. It was settled half a century ago by a treaty between the two countries and with the guarantee of four American republics.\nThe second rectification is designed to alert the international community to the Ecuadorian attempt to move into a different context a matter that should be solved through the contractual mechanisms of the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro of 1942, thereby trying to distort the nature of this bilateral question by internationalising it. In fact, according to Article VII of the above-mentioned treaty, which definitively established the borders between Peru and Ecuador, any disagreement or doubt regarding its application must be solved by the parties with the participation of the guarantor countries of the treaty: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America.\nCircumventing this mechanism by trying to invoke the worthy, respectable intervention of His Holiness John Paul II has the sole objective, the hidden purpose, of disavowing an international treaty, signed by the Governments of both countries, approved by their respective congresses and ratified according to international law, under the guarantee of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America, who signed this treaty in said capacity of guarantors. If this attempt were to be accepted, no international treaty would be able to stand, since the basic principle of respect for international treaties would be ignored, thus tearing apart the international legal structure so painstakingly built over the years on the basis of peaceful coexistence. This would endanger continental and world security.\nThe inviolability of borders and the respect for international treaties are principles without which it would not have been possible, for example, to build the new Europe or to consolidate peace between Iraq and Kuwait, which is based upon the undeniable legal foundations of United Nations Security Council resolution 687 of 3 April 1991.\nFor these reasons, from this highest of international forums we call upon our sister Republic of Ecuador and demand that aha fit her deeds to her declarations of peace, justice and respect for law by submitting any disagreement or doubt on the implementation of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries of 29 January 1942, or on the verdict of the Brazilian arbitrator Bras Dies da Aguiar, to the guarantor countries of said treaty, for it is they, as guarantors with the authority to do so, not us, who must resolve these questions, in accordance with Articles V and VII of the above-mentioned Protocol.\nIt is not Peru, therefore, that is avoiding a peaceful and immediate solution to the alleged territorial problem. It is Ecuador that refuses to resort to the final say of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America, countries that have repeatedly offered to fulfil their commitment as guarantors of the Protocol, as they have recently affirmed in their declaration issued in Brasilia on 15 September 1991.\nThe existence of a fully applicable legal instrument makes improper the appeal to His Holiness for arbitration, whose moral authority is beyond any doubt, as are the profound religious sentiments of the peoples of Peru and Ecuador.\nIn the present context, with the restoration of the validity of international peace and security, the peoples of Peru and Ecuador expect a great deal from their Governments' capacity for agreement and cooperation, with a view to projecting harmoniously into the future the profound historical, geographical, social and cultural roots that link them and that should turn them into a powerful integrating nucleus at the core of the Andean community, which will be indispensable if Latin America is to fashion itself into a true some of peace.\nThat is why the proposal made yesterday by the President of Ecuador for the establishment of a some of peace in South America is fully consistent with the initiative which was launched by President Alberto Fujimori on 18 July last at the first Ibero-American summit, in Guadalajara, and which, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru, I hope to implement by inviting my colleagues of the Rio Group to sign in Lima in the near future a declaration renouncing weapons of mass destruction in Latin America and to start consultations aimed at consolidating peace, security and development in the region.\nUnder the guidance of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, the United Nations system has emerged from its longest period of stagnation and inertia. It has attained a higher level of efficiency, and the redefinition of its role has given it unusual momentum. The optimism that has resulted from this is not baseless; indeed, it is based on new and encouraging prospects for shared work and collective action.\nAs a Peruvian and a Latin American, I am proud of the eminent role played by my distinguished fellow countrymen in this age of unprecedented achievements. The recent institutional adjustments which I have already\nmentioned and those in the international system itself cannot be viewed in isolation from the discretion, constancy and imagination of Mr. Perez de Cuellar's historic administration. I am certain this recognition is shared by the International community at large.\nThe contemporary world confronts present generations with a qualitatively different challenge. This is an era in which mankind will have to prove its capacity to manage the planet in an equitable manner. This vast challenge is not a consequence of war but a creative consensual act. It is therefore necessary to secure a renewed role for the United Nations, which should become the fundamental agent in the promotion of international cooperation for development, because it is the only institution capable of managing this complex historic transition. This is true today more than ever before, because it summons the vitality and creativity of the peoples of the world, the political will of their Governments and the leadership of its Secretariat.\nPeru, aware of these changes, is immersed in a sweeping process of national renewal. Its success depends on our own efforts and perseverance, but also on the international community's support and sensitivity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to begin by expressing our thanks and sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Malta, President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, for conducting the work of this body with such ability and wisdom. Our thanks and appreciation go as well to the Secretary -General, Mr. Javier Peres do Cuellar, for the continued efforts he and his assistants in the general Secretariat have ceaselessly exerted in pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express on behalf of the Government of the custodian of the two holy mosques our gratitude and appreciation to the international community represented by the General Assembly of the United Nations for the confidence it has entrusted in electing you, Sir, to preside over this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. While we take great pride in this confidence and trust we wish to assure this august body of the continued support of the custodian of the two holy mosques and his Government for the United Nations and of his commitment to its noble goals and to all efforts aimed at strengthening the role of this body.\nMoreover, it is indeed a pleasure to welcome the new Members of the United Nations - the Republics of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, hoping that their membership will enhance the effectiveness and universality of collective international action. We also wish the peoples of these countries all stability and progress.\nThe dramatic events and stunning changes we have witnessed and continue to witness today on the international arena augur well for a major historic transformation now that the authoritarian regimes which were based on futile ideological rivalry have begun to collapse and disappear, and the curtain has been rung down on an era of cold war and heated confrontations. That was an era in which vast human and material resources were wanted in n costly and terrifying arms race and which inflicted great suffering upon a considerable portion of the international community in the shape of poverty, hunger and disease. That, of course, had negative economic, political and security effects on the entire International community and especially upon the developing countries.\nToday, we all witness the shaping of a new international order whose foundations rest upon the principles of the United Nations and its mainstay, namely international legality. That is an international order in which all nations, large and small, rich and poor are equal in exercising their right to sovereignty, independence and living in peace; an international order which safeguards the internationally recognized boundaries of each country and does not tolerate interference by one nation in another's internal affairs and which recognises and respects the right of all peoples to self-determination and sovereignty over their resources; an international order in which there is no place for hegemony and tyranny nor for political blackmail; and an international order which adopts peaceful means for the settlement of disputes and renounces the use of force or the threat thereof for the purpose of realizing expansionist goals or economic ambitions. We as Muslims welcome these historic transformations and look forward to strengthening the foundation of this new order and employing its principles in the interests of regional security and stability, the peaceful resolution of disputes, spreading economic welfare and consolidating world peace.\nPerhaps one of the most prominent indications that this new international order has indeed emerged is the unprecedented, firm stand taken by the international community towards the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. When we met here a year ago the world was faced by a horrifying event and a grave tragedy, namely the occupation by a Member State of the Organisation, Iraq, of another smaller Member, Kuwait, and the blatant attempt to destroy its sovereignty, identity and indeed its very existence as a nation. That was a horrifying event for everyone but for Arabs and Muslims it was especially painful. He felt overwhelming bitterness to know that the stab in our back did not come from an enemy we ware warily watching, or from a malevolent envier harbouring hate towards our people. Rather, it came from a brother to whom we had offered our unlimited support and granted our unconditional trust, a brother we had stood by in time of hardship and towards whom we offered human and material sacrifices.\nHowever, injustice cannot last nor aggression persist. The ordeal has revealed the true and noble metal of our people in the entire Gulf region who stood in unity by their rightful and legitimate leadership under the banner of right and rallied to rescue the victim. It was a cause for pride to have our Arab and Muslim brethren and other friendly nations from across the globe standing by us and fighting on the battlefields of honour in support of justice and legality.\nThe world community did not disappoint us. The international community took a firm and courageous decision immediately to stand up in the face of aggression. This position was reflected in subsequent United Nations resolutions through a unique show of international consensus, which indicates that we are truly on the threshold of a new era in international relations. In this era there is no place for tyrants who suppress the will of the people or invaders who destroy other nations. We have seen the fullest expression of this will when the whole world. State after State, refused to recognize a de facto situation imposed by force and aggression.\nI should like, on behalf of the custodian of the two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz, to thank all the countries, peoples and organizations who stood against injustice and supported the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in its defence of its security and territorial integrity, whether by material participation in repelling the Iraqi aggression or through support in the international forums.\nIt is necessary to recall these events in order to diagnose the ills which have befallen us so that we might deal with the results of the tragedy. The conclusion which must be drawn from this tragedy is that no benefit will accrue from aggression and that the aggressor shall be made to bear the consequences of his actions. Furthermore, we must establish such measures as would prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported all Security Council resolutions pertaining to the invasion of the State of Kuwait by Iraq and has supported and continues to support all international measures aiming at the enforcement of these resolutions.\nWe are totally convinced that, the prevention of the recurrence of such as aggression is not possible without, the continued observance of the dictates of international legality and the full implementation of all the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Therefore, we call upon the International community to maintain its adherence to those resolutions and insist on their full and speedy implementation.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia follows with great sorrow and grave concern the suffering of the people of Iraq, which is an Inevitable consequence of the oppressive policies pursued by the Iraqi regime. He are totally convinced that the human ordeal of the people of Iraq is receiving the appropriate attention of the United Nations, and especially of the Committee which was established by the Security Council to deal with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.\nThe full compliance by Iraq with all the Security Council resolutions and its cooperation with the Special Committee will ensure that such humanitarian needs will be taken care of and, at the same time, contribute to fostering the principles of peace and stability in the region.\nThe new international order undoubtedly has its implications for international and regional relations as manifested in various political, security and economic fields.\nOur experience in the Gulf area proved that the threat to our security has, in fact, emanated from within the region itself. The region had witnessed a devastating war between Iraq and Iran before it was again tormented by the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. It has become clear that enduring stability in the Gulf region requires that the relations between the countries of the Gulf be based on solid and firm foundations and on the principles of international law. They must be characterised by equality among nations and mutual commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and non-interference in the internal affairs of each other. This should be accomplished on the basis of mutual respect and common interest.\nIt was, therefore, only natural that our experience should affect the way matters have evolved in the region and serve as a catalyst for a promising future vision for us. It is no longer acceptable to allow the security of our region to remain subject to the whims of those who have expansionist and subversive hegemonistic ambitions or the gamblers who are ready to risk away not only the interests of their own people but also those of the whole region and the world at large.\nThe leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council have given much attention and careful consideration to the future security arrangements of their region based on self-reliance and cooperation with brotherly and friendly countries in matters that serve the security and stability objectives.\nThe Arab order has suffered a terrifying blow during the crisis of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The overhaul of this order has become a necessity if it is to be able to prevent a recurrence of similar tragic events. It is in this context that the Arab countries that supported our international legality sought to establish a new Arab order which should be based on the spirit of brotherhood, solidarity and mutual interest. These concepts have been incorporated in the Damascus Declaration, which was adopted by the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Syrian Arab Republic and the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council.\nThe Damascus Declaration is based on the principles of international law for the purpose of establishing friendly relations and peaceful coexistence, on the one hand, and bringing into reality the mutual desire to build real and serious cooperation and solidarity in political, economic, security and cultural fields, on the other. This effort was not an axis aimed against anyone. Rather, it represents a sincere call to reform the Arab order in accordance with these concepts within the framework of the Arab League.\nOur Arab region cannot alone remain unaffected by these new and fast-moving currents which are changing the patterns of relations between nations and peoples. While stressing, especially in the wake of the tragedy which has befallen the Arab world, that it is unreasonable or unacceptable to base our decisions and actions on measures and standards other than those adopted by the world community, we therefore urge that all the issues of our region, especially the Palestinian question, which is the pivotal issue of the region, should benefit from these positive developments which are taking place in the international arena.\nToday, there exists an historic opportunity for the launching of a peace process aimed at ending the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieving a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian question - a solution that conforms with United Nations resolutions and restores and consecrates the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people; a solution that institutes permanent principles for security and stability in the Middle East based on international legality and on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nThere now exists a mechanism for achieving these goals - a peace conference, which is expected to be held In the near future. Within this framework, the Government of the custodian of the two holy mosques offers its full support for the efforts of President George Bush of the United States of America - brought to fruition by Secretary of State James Baker - to have an international conference convened with a view to achieving durable and equitable peace in the Middle East and resolving the Palestinian question. It fully supports the convening of the peace conference with the aim of achieving these objectives. It also affirms that the building of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories, including East Al-Quds and the Golan Heights, is a serious violation of international law and of United Nations resolutions, and is also a major obstacle to the efforts and attempts that are being made to achieve peace in the Middle East.\nIt is indeed our hope that the will for peace will prevail and that the international community will apply to the Palestinian question the same principles as it applied to the Gulf crisis that arose when Iraq invaded Kuwait, so that international legality may be firmly established, and the principles of justice, freedom and the right of peoples to self determination strongly upheld. The Arabs have chosen the road to peace. Within this framework, we welcome the declaration Issued by the Palestinian national Council in its last session, which confirms this orientation towards peace. Today we are at an historic crossroads. It is only natural that we should choose the path of peace, for we are a nation urged by its religion to call for, and to heed the call for, peace, in total compliance with the order of God Almighty: \\\"Should they lean toward peace then you must lean toward it, and you must trust in God.\\\"\nAs we see successive indications that the new international order is indeed emerging, we follow with great interest and admiration the achievements of the Government of Lebanon. We support the successful steps taken by that Government to implement the provisions of the national reconciliation agreement concluded in the Taif conference, especially those pertaining to its role, through its own forces, in re-instituting the authority of the State of Lebanon over the entire Lebanese territory.\nWe also followed with great interest the speech of Mr. Elias Hraoui, President of the Republic of Lebanon, in which he called upon the international community to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and in which he stressed his Government's determination to face up to the considerable challenges involved in restoring matters to their normal course. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia joins the President of Lebanon in urging the international community to contribute in a positive manner to Lebanon's reconstruction efforts through the international fund for the assistance of Lebanon. We are pleased that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will host the inaugural meeting of this fund in the near future, and we welcome the participation in, and the contributions to, the reconstruction of Lebanon by all organisations as well as sisterly countries and industrialised nations.\nSince the beginning of the distressing events in Somalia the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, acting on its historic Islamic and national sense of responsibility and out of its commitment to the territorial integrity of that sister country, took the initiative of urging all parties there to come to the negotiating table and to solve their problems in a way that would preserve the unity, security and stability of Somalia, so that the country might resume its role in support of Islamic and Arab solidarity.\nThere is cause for optimism that this crisis will be overcome. I refer to the progress made at the meetings of the reconciliation conference that was convened under the auspices of Hassan Goulide Aptidon, President of the Republic of Djibouti. The conference continued its deliberations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the auspices of the custodian of the two holy mosques. King Fahd bin Abdulaziz, resulted in a cease-fire agreement, and secured the commitment of all parties to the search for reconciliation and national unity. We are indeed hopeful that this will lead to full reconciliation and will eliminate all obstacles and overcome other difficulties in its path, for security and stability should return to the land of this sister country.\nThe struggle of the Afghani people to preserve their beliefs, independence and sovereignty requires the attention of all of us. The Government of Saudi Arabia has constantly supported the struggle of the Afghani people, who deserve to enjoy stability under a Government of their own\nchoosing - one that realises their aspirations for the preservation of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The government of the custodian of the two holy mosques hopes for a peaceful solution that satisfies these aspirations. We have previously commended the Afghan Mujahidin for their support for the Secretary-General's report. We wish to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at the joint decision of the Governments of the United States of America and of the Soviet Union to stop arms supplies to Afghanistan, and at their desire to achieve a final solution to the Afghan problem that will guarantee the return of peace to that long-suffering country, whose people have made enormous sacrifices. He also fully appreciate the commendable efforts being made in this regard by the Secretary-General. The custodian of the two holy mosques underscored the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for these efforts when he met the Secretary-General recently.\nThe African continent has recently witnessed successive victories scored by the people of South Africa. A new era, in which the racial discrimination laws will certainly be dismantled, is being ushered in. At this point, we cannot but express our appreciation to, and our admiration of, the people of South Africa. We look forward to the day when the policy of apartheid and discrimination in South Africa will be fully abolished.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported and continues to support the efforts to control and limit the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in any place on earth. We must note with satisfaction the important and successful steps recently taken by the Governments of the United States of America and the Soviet Union which culminated in the conclusion of an historic Treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons. Ha command, too, the courageous initiative revealed a few days ago by President George Bush which calls for deep cuts in the various types of nuclear weapons and which proposes further reductions in the most dangerous of those weapons.\nIn compliance with its policy of pursuing all peace efforts, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has become a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and abided by its provisions. It has also declared in various international forums its support for the efforts to ban all chemical and biological weapons.\nThe Government of the custodian of the two holy mosques strongly believes that the Middle East region - which has suffered a number of wars and armed conflicts and become a stockpiling and production area for a variety of weapons of mass destruction - is indeed the region which most needs to be free of such weapons. The Government of the custodian of the two holy mosques has expressed its support for all initiatives aimed at limiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region.\nToday, with a new international order in the making, we are hopeful that the international economic issues will receive the attention they deserve from the international community. We are quite convinced that peace and security in the world cannot be achieved - or indeed endure - unless based on principles of equality, cooperation and justice. Therefore, facing up to the economic problems at this important juncture in international relations and under the new International climate, will require efforts to advance the cooperation between developing and developed countries based on the fact that security and economic development are but two sides of one coin. Indeed, no economic development is possible without security, nor is security or stability achievable in the absence of economic development.\nFor this reason, it has become necessary for the developed nations to fulfil their promises to raise their contributions of official development assistance to reach the objectives of the International Development Strategy adopted by the United Nations. They should also work to increase the efficiency of the international monetary system, stimulate the flow of international trade by improving the conditions of market accessibility for developing nations exports to reach their markets, and set fair and equitable prices commensurate with those charged for their imports from the developed countries. It is also hoped that they will contribute to the efforts aimed at encouraging the transfer of technology suited to the needs and conditions of the developing nations.\nBelieving in the close relationship and interdependency between security and development, and as a way of contributing to the establishment of solid stability and progress in the world, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sister States, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, took the initiative to announce the establishment of the Gulf programme for assisting developmental efforts in the Arab world. And as a recognition of the fact that funding of development efforts is indeed an international and collective responsibility, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls on the industrial nations to join this programme, support its objectives and facilitate the achievement of its lofty objectives.\nThe new international order, which is at its Inception, ii an order where hope* are high and challenges great. Yet, we all have a grave responsibility towards our future generations, to construct it in such a way as to save these future generations from the dangers of repeating the mistakes of the past. He should create together future horizons where peace, security, mutual trust and understanding may loom large and where our future generations may enjoy stability and prosperity.\n\\\"Say, work. For God will see your work, and so will His apostle and the believers.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is a real pleasure for me to see you presiding over our deliberations. I am sure that under your skilful guidance this session of the General Assembly will proceed smoothly and successfully.\nIt is heartening to note the significant increase in the membership of the United Nations. On behalf of my Government I warmly welcome among us the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands as well as the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\nIn particular, Finland salutes the membership of its Baltic neighbours, with which we have now re-established relations and entered into close cooperation. The fact that the Baltic States have regained their rightful place among the independent nations reflects the profound change now under way. So far the most striking results of this change are visible mainly in Europe. However, this is a world-wide change and it has an impact everywhere. The divided world which emerged after the Second World War is now giving way to a new order.\nThe old power structures were founded on the outcome of the war and the military strength of the respective countries. The United Nations was created then to forestall the causes of future wars. Soon, however, the antagonism between East and West began to grow. The military alliances were established. The Soviet Union and the United States developed into military super-Powers. The power struggle between East and West extended all over the world and was entwined, as an essential part, in all major regional crises.\nAlong with the military antagonisms and the arms race, nations have been competing in the economic and technological fields. The nature of this competition has changed markedly during the past few decades. We have moved into an area of high technology and world-wide integration. This creates growing interdependence between nations, but also increases differences. Economically and technologically strong nations are able to become even more advanced and thus to increase their international influence.\nThe old world order is passing into history, and a new one is emerging. In Europe, this has led from confrontation to co-operation. A new comprehensive European architecture is currently being worked out. In order to cope with new conflicts that emerge and to safeguard peaceful and democratic change, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will have to be strengthened. The basic principles of CSCE are solid, but its working methods and operational capabilities need to be further improved. We hope and expect that the CSCE follow-up meeting and the summit to be held in Helsinki next year will break new ground in this regard.\nTragically, in Yugoslavia, political ferment has led to increasing violence with potentially unsettling consequences for the whole of Europe. Finland supports the efforts of the CSCE and the European Community to stop the cycle of violence and to help find a political solution in Yugoslavia. United Nations support for these efforts is also vital.\nElsewhere in the world the new realities have facilitated the settlement of several regional conflicts. Namibia was set free. Apartheid is disappearing. Conflicts in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Central America and Western Sahara are being wound down. Even in the intractable Middle East there is a glimmer of hope.\nThe best example of the strengthened role of the United Nations is the liberation of Kuwait and the restoration of its independence. The Charter of the United Nations withstood a violent challenge to its authority. The Security Council acted promptly and effectively. The United Nations is and must continue to be actively engaged in alleviating the suffering caused by the Gulf War. This is true of humanitarian and other assistance, peace-keeping, as well as the elimination of Iraq's remaining weapons of mass destruction. Respect for international law and collective security remains the basis of protecting the security of all States, especially the smaller ones.\nSide by side with these positive trends, global problems remain that have to be tackled. On the one hand, the economic and social problems of the developing countries continue undiminished. Poverty and want are increasing. Development prospects remain bleak. On the other hand, the Eastern and Central European countries, striving towards democracy, respect for human rights and a market economy, need and must be given economic support. Therefore, the developed nations must help solve these world-wide problems of development in a true spirit of global partnership.\nThe time has come to unravel the conflict that exists between the economy of man and that of nature. The tasks involved are not entirely contradictory; improved technology in the less developed countries can help achieve both a higher material standard of living and an ecologically sounder society. Yet, humanity must face the truth: the present trend leads inevitably to depletion of natural resources, climatic changes and serious damage to nature. We are endangering our own welfare and that of our children. If the present trend continues, the very existence of mankind will be in question.\nThe combined effect of environmental destruction, population growth and climate change can be both rapid and irreversible. The world has little time to change its ways. Therefore, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development must become a turning-point, the beginning of a process towards ecologically sustainable development. My Government hopes that the ongoing negotiations on global framework conventions on climate change and biodiversity can be concluded in time for the Conference. Another process of global negotiations that will, we hope, be initiated by the Conference is the framework convention on forestry. The livelihood of my own country is to a great extent derived from forestry and forest resources. Forests grow slowly, but. can be squandered quickly. I speak from experience and with conviction when I emphasise the importance of forests in global resource management.\nThere is one cure for many environmental problems: forestation and reforestation. Forests provide fuel wood. Forests prevent desertification, floods and erosion. Forests protect cultivated land and shelter flora and fauna. Forests temper extreme changes in the climate and slow down more permanent changes. Moreover, forests absorb carbon dioxide.\nAll these environmental and developmental concerns, which have emerged during recent decades, present a formidable challenge to mankind. In order to meet this challenge we have to capture today the same sense of solidarity and joint responsibility that inspired the birth of nation-States. We have to incorporate into our political systems a new, global level. The world needs a new global architecture for human interaction, decision-making and cooperation. Such a new world architecture must take into account current realities. The responsibility for both development and the environment should be borne by nations according to the ratio of their power and wealth. The strongest economic Powers, which profit most from world-wide integration, should bear the main responsibility for helping those countries that do not have sufficient possibilities to succeed in this competition. Burden-sharing in financing, be it development aid or environmental investments, should be based not only on capacities in terms of gross national product, but also in terms of current account surpluses of national economies. Furthermore, we have to consider whether the share of financing for the environment, could be based on the use of non renewable natural resources and the damage caused to nature. Those countries that profit most should pay the largest share of the costs involved.\nWhen conceptualising this new architecture of global decision-making, we must also be ready to reform and strengthen existing structures for international cooperation. In this regard, reform of the United Nations system becomes essential.\nTherefore my Government welcomes the proposal by the Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organisation, that a well-organised process of analysis and consultation be initiated in which Governments can outline their priorities for the achievement of their desired objectives for the Organisation.\nLet me in this context say that the Secretary-General's report is yet another manifestation of the lucid and thoughtful reasoning that the Member States have come to expect from him. His tenure at the helm of the Organization has added immeasurably to the effectiveness and prestige of the United Nations.\nThe reforms in the economic and social fields call for a new kind of division of responsibilities. This can be done without changing the democratic nature of the world Organization. The objective must be to maintain the United Nations in the forefront of development activities. With this in mind, the Nordic countries have undertaken a study called the \\\"Nordic United Nations Project\\\". It reflects the desire of our Governments, which provide about one third of the financing of United Nations development activities, to make the system more transparent, responsive and accountable.\nRegarding humanitarian assistance, the structures and coordination within the United Nations must be clarified and strengthened system-wide. In order to improve the ability of the United Nations to alleviate humanitarian emergencies and environmental catastrophes rapidly, the concept of so-called United Nations Green Helmets deserves, in my view, close: study and consideration.\nThe capacity of the United Nations to maintain and restore international peace and security is of continuing concern to Finland. The clandestine pursuit of weapons o\u00a3 mass destruction and massive transfers of conventional arms are cause for growing and justified concern. These sources of present and future instability need to be addressed by the international community through strengthening non-proliferation arrangements and through novel approaches. Thus Finland strongly supports increased transparency in international arms transfers. The establishment of a universal and non-discriminatory register of such transfers under United Nations management is an appropriate and pragmatic way to begin.\nFinland has consistently supported United Rations peace-keeping activities. We have long been one of the most important troop-contributing countries. He support the extension of United Nations peace-keeping into new fields, including that of the prevention of conflicts. We attach particular importance to strengthening further the role of the United Nations in the context of peace-making and peace enforcement. The strengthening of the United Nations peace-keeping role requires additional budgetary resources. I find it intolerable that the United Nations is constantly required to launch new operations without the certainty of full and timely financing from its membership.\nThe new and more effective role of the United Nations in this area is currently being studied by the Nordic countries, and we are actively engaged in formulating concrete proposals in this regard.\nThe United Nations was born to prevent war. That primary responsibility remains valid. However, five decades ago it was not possible to foresee how extensive the present and future problems of development and environment would be. When the Charter of the United Nations was formulated, nobody knew what role economic and technological developments would play and what effects they would have internationally. How, as the Organisation is approaching its fiftieth anniversary, there is ample reason for a thorough review of the challenges the United Nations is facing and of the adequacy of its structures and mechanisms, including the Charter, to respond to them. We need a new world architecture.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay we first of all say how extremely pleased we are, Sir, at seeing you elected to the presidency of this Assembly in order to direct the work of its forty-sixth regular session. Your great skill, recognised experience and effective leadership all augur well for this gathering of reflection and decision-making at the highest universal level. Our pleasure at your election is accompanied by our appreciation of the outstanding work accomplished by your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, and we would like to emphasise that this range of merits and accomplishments represents the continuation of the major and fruitful developments so characteristic of this forum in which the international community gathers to deal with the most important questions of today's world. We wish also to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his positive work at the head of the Organization which this year has gained still greater stature, given the scope that the international political situation now allows for the fundamental work of the United Nations. Confidence in multilateralism has increased considerably, strengthening the credibility and capacity for action of the United Nations and opening up new fields in which it is can help resolve specific problems. In the case of El Salvador, the United Nations, through the Secretary-General, has been engaged in long-term constructive work reflected in the United Nations mission for the verification of the agreements arising out of the negotiation process now under way. This task, of an unprecedented magnitude and responsibility, is only one demonstration of the swift and basically unique changes taking place throughout the world.\nThe Assembly is initiating its work at a high-water mark in the history of mankind. We are seeing and feeling with unusual closeness the movement of historical mechanisms not as the abstract expression of the dynamics of our times, but rather as the fascinating pulse of history itself at its deepest levels of reasoning. The virtual disappearance of all totalitarian dogma, which just yesterday seemed so solid, evokes the ancient theme of the power of freedom, not as a theory but as a fact.\nI need not dwell on the differences of development and material power between regions and States. But it is appropriate to point out that for the greater part of this century the development of an incredible system of intimidation in the world order has seemed to replace the very energy of man as a free being and a protagonist, of history. What we are now seeing is the re-emergence of that spiritual and moral energy which prevails over even the most sophisticated machinery of destruction. Power is once again being centred on the freedom of the human being. This is in itself the beginning of a refashioned world and of an inevitable rapprochement between regions and peoples. For freedom has similar problems both within the great Powers and in the small countries of the so-called third world, a category that is now obsolete, since the terminology of the \\\"cold war\\\" has been overtaken by events.\nWe Salvadorians have been the scapegoats of that abusive and irrational polarity that divided the world into inevitable factions on the basis of an artificial Ideological fanaticism. The Salvadorian war was not invented by any one but arose as a manifestation of grave shortcomings and errors within our society; but once unleashed, it took on the shadings of the global conflict and received Inputs that prolonged the war until the present. As we see it, then, the end of the \\\"cold war\\\" is not just good news for everyone but rather a particularly encouraging augury for our own domestic situation and for opportunities for genuine and effective peacemaking.\nThis is the reason we are here, raising our voice in what is really the first General Assembly held against an international background in which the bitter East-West conflict has virtually ceased to exist. The recent events in the Soviet Union, which are an expression of the universal vitality of the democratic movement, give grounds for hoping that we are rapidly moving towards a new era of realistic cooperation and reasonable understanding among nations based on pragmatism and free of the false simplifications of one-sided ideologies.\nWe want to emphasize that experience teaches us that only a tolerant and open-minded pragmatism can resolve problems and confront reality. This is what we are promoting in El Salvador, which is emerging from the destructive turbulence of war and is moving towards a post-war period that will be difficult but that must be marked by national reconciliation. At the economic level, pragmatism has taught us the need to promote a programme of adjustment and recovery that can prepare us for productivity and competition. In our search for peace, pragmatism tells us that we must discard any thought of military solutions and continue, as we have been doing, our effort to achieve political solutions. In the international sphere, pragmatism teaches us that integration and cooperation are the only ways to join the great movement towards development. Of course, the pragmatism we advocate does not mean forgetting or setting aside principles. Quite the contrary. As we see it, the greatest pragmatism is called democracy and we are unswerving and fervent advocates of democracy as a system of government and as a way of life. \nThis is the third time I have ascended this rostrum since taking office as President of El Salvador on 1 June 1989. Each time, we have come to speak of peace, coming together and reconciliation among Salvadorans following over a decade of fratricidal war. Early in our Administration, some doubted our intentions; we preferred not to respond to those doubts but rather to wait until time could speak for us. Two years later, the process of peacemaking and democratisation in El Salvador has made persevering and significant progress. We present those results not as a personal achievement but as the product of efforts by all Salvadorans, who are deeply tired of war and who want at last to find the path of peace. From this international forum I pay a tribute of admiration and gratitude to those millions of Salvadorans who through adversity and stoicism have taught us that is possible to hope for a better future.\nWe Salvadorans are not alone in those aspirations and efforts. Fortunately, our struggle for freedom and the building of our democracy coincides with a broad, vigorous movement, in Central America and throughout the world, in the same direction.\nIn Central America - which the sister republic of Panama has now joined as a full-fledged member - the work of economic, social and political integration is progressing with encouraging dynamism. In our region there is a great awareness of unity, as has been recognized by the Central American Presidents, who at their tenth summit meeting, held recently in San Salvador, recognized that\n\\\"the world changes and transformations of recent years place Central America at a point in history that requires a renewed vision of its own process of integration and of involvement in a world order characterized by interdependence, the emergence of new forms of integration and cooperation and the effective application of international law.\\\" As for Latin America, the Guadalajara summit, which had an Ibero-American scope, was another unprecedented event with major implications for the future. The Mexico meeting, which demonstrated the extraordinary leadership of that fraternal country, was unanimously welcomed and ended with a declaration whose importance can be gauged from a reading of the first paragraph alone:\n\\\"It is with special pleasure that we have met, for the first time in history, to examine together the great challenges facing our countries in a changing world. We therefore propose to pool the political will of our Governments to promote the solutions demanded by these challenges and to transform the historical and cultural affinities that bind us into an instrument of unity and development based on dialogue, cooperation and solidarity.\\\"\nI want to underscore those three words - dialogue, cooperation and solidarity - as the keys to a new era characterized by coexistence within States as well as by the dynamics of international relations. The era of arrogance and abuse is becoming a thing of the past, leaving untold death and trauma in its wake. Intolerance and fear attempted to take over the human spirit during our century - which is also the century of technological marvels. It was time for science and the modes of human coexistence to leap into the future by regaining the freedom to create and to believe in a world worthy of mankind and of the great endeavour of freedom.\nIn the political sphere, walls are crumbling, myths collapsing and freedom advancing with amazing vitality. But the challenge does not atop there. Social development is too fragile for us to rest quietly. We believe that, in order to be solid and lasting, democracy must encompass the political, social, economic and cultural spheres. We must not forget - perhaps because the devastating experience of war makes for lucid realism that the centre of the process is man, with his needs, rights and aspirations. It is man that In many parts of the world still suffers the scourges of extreme poverty, social marginalisation, discrimination, uncertainty and ignorance, among other evils. That is a challenge to the universal conscience. For that reason we favour convening a world summit for social development, which could take this problem to a truly global level of consideration.\nThe new international order is emerging, which is of vast importance to our Organisation. The United Nations is gaining new areas of activity in a world that demands ever greater multilateral communication. We must give new vitality to the principles of universality and efficiency, for today the work of the Organisation is becoming increasingly broad and complex. Speaking of universality, we are pleased to welcome the admission of seven new Members to the United Nations family. In some cases, such as those of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, this admission is dramatic, moving and encouraging. But in all cases, we convey to the representatives of the seven new Members of the Organization our warmest welcome in the certainty that their contribution to the work of the United Nations will be excellent and a source of strength.\nOur presence at United Rations Headquarters has special significance on this occasion. For a week before this address to the General Assembly we have been working intensively with the Secretary-General to find a way to accelerate the solution to the Salvadoran conflict. We are completely convinced that the time has come for war to come to an end in El Salvador. Both the Salvadoran people and the international community are rightly impatient for peace to begin its constructive course in our country. We have been working unceasingly and tirelessly to achieve that goal, which is now very close at hand. In this endeavour with the Secretary-General we have achieved important progress towards ensuring that 1991 will be the year of peace. The main roadblocks have been removed, and only the final details remain to be resolved.\nThis is enormously encouraging news for the Salvadoran people, and we want to share it with the other nations of the world, many of which have followed very closely the process on which we Salvadorans have embarked. El Salvador has gained the world's attention because of war, but now we deserve and demand the world's attention in favour of the peace we are approaching through democracy. We ask the international community for all necessary support for Salvadoran democracy, so that our country can continue to progress, with freedom and justice, towards stability and progress.\nGiven the level and importance of the results achieved at the New York meeting between the Government and the FMLN, with the direct assistance of the Secretary-General, we consider that total agreement on an end to the conflict could be a reality in the very near future. A rapid de-escalation of armed confrontation and an end to all forms of violence affecting the civilian population are goals to which we shall give immediate, special attention. We want the Salvadoran people to enjoy the tranquillity and security it deserves, and we shall examine and propose ways to achieve that sincerely, genuinely and as quickly as possible.\nAs always, we request the international community's confidence and support for our efforts, and we ask God to enlighten all of us who believe in peace and who are working humbly and steadfastly to achieve it.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffExactly a year ago the World Summit on the Child was convened in this Hall, attended by several Heads of State, including His Excellency Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, President of the Republic of the Gambia. The high-powered representation at the Summit, the solemnity of the occasion and the important and far-reaching decisions that were taken, culminating in the adoption of the Charter on the Rights of the Child, testify to the Importance attached to women and children. It is in the name of these two most vulnerable groups, whose hopes and survival are reposed in the United Nations system, that I should like to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I am confident that, as a seasoned diplomat endowed with the necessary skill and experience, he will steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion, and that the hopes and aspirations that were aroused at that Summit will continue to be in the forefront of our deliberations throughout this session so that the welfare and interests of these target groups will always be paramount in the programmes and activities of the United Nations system.\nIt is also a considerable pleasure for me to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, for the very able manner in which he guided the deliberations of the forty-fifth session of the Assembly.\nMy delegation would also like to place on record its appreciation and gratitude to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and his staff for having conducted the affairs of the Organization in such a manner that the Organization has been given an invigorated role as an effective instrument for the protection and maintenance of international peace and security.\nI should also like to seize this opportunity to convey, on behalf of the Government of the Gambia and my delegation, our heartfelt congratulations to the Governments of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on their admission as new Members of the United Nations. The admission of these 8tates as new Members is in accordance with the principle of universality of our Organisation, and we look forward to their active participation and their positive contributions to the cause of peace and International understanding in the comity of nations. With regard to the two Koreas in particular, we hope that their simultaneous membership will create a favourable atmosphere leading to the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.\nThe forty-sixth session of the Assembly is taking place against the backdrop of dramatic changes in international relations characterised by the end of the cold war and bipolarity, as well as by increased pressure for wider democratisation and respect for human rights. For us in the Gambia, the concepts of political pluralism and respect for human rights constitute the cardinal principles of our domestic and foreign policies and we cannot but welcome these developments. Human rights are desirable for their own sake because they promote the individual's well-being. They are also desirable for society as a whole because they promote economic, social and political development. However, the concept of human rights should not be based on social and political expediency. The concepts of democracy and political pluralism can be meaningful only if they are based on established social rules - the rule of law that govern and protect human behaviour. Thus in its full meaning, the concept of human rights presupposes the voluntary assumption of moral obligations, self-discipline, order, responsibility, duty and accountability.\nIn this sense, therefore, political development end economic welfare are inseparable from respect and protection of human rights and human dignity. This calls for a fight, against poverty, hunger, disease, underdevelopment and racism; a fight for the welfare of the most vulnerable! women, children, old people, the sick and the disabled, the migrant and the refugee. In short, human rights are the right to development aimed primarily at the welfare of the human being.\nIt is against this background that we continue to champion the cause of human rights, particularly in Africa and our subregion. As the headquarters of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies, the Gambia is well placed to take up this responsibility. We shall continue to use the good offices of these institutions for monitoring the progress, or otherwise, of the furtherance of human rights and for teaching and research. We hope that the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights will offer a unique opportunity for all concerned to address these very significant issues, and we look forward to the Conference with a large measure of hope and encouragement.\nIf respect for human rights and political pluralism is the sine qua non for the attainment of social and economic development, so too is respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all States, rich or poor, big or small, which is indispensable for the maintenance of world peace and security. That is why the successful campaign in the Gulf region to resist aggression and to restore the inalienable rights of the Kuwaiti people constitutes an important milestone in the history of the United Nations. For around this time last year the world was on the brink of a crisis with uncertain but terrifying ramifications, and it is thanks to the united front adopted by our Organisation that the conflict was contained and sanity and the rule of law in inter-State relations restored.\nThe conflict in the Gulf region may be over, but the crisis still remains and will remain for so long as the relevant Security Council resolutions are not implemented. My delegation therefore calls on Iraq to comply with all United Nations resolutions, for in so doing it will contribute towards the peace and security of the region and bring to a speedy end the long and unnecessary suffering of the Iraqi people.\nIn the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, the world view about the role and efficacy of our Organisation has improved tremendously, and the United Nations has emerged from the crisis with its reputation not only intact but considerably enhanced. At the same time, one must recognise and applaud the cooperation and solidarity of the States in the region in resisting aggression, for without this cooperation and solidarity the task of the United Nations would have been more difficult to discharge. My delegation would therefore like to congratulate once more the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, in particular, for their unity of purpose and action, which will serve as a general principle for regional cooperation in resolving regional conflicts.\nPeace in the Gulf can be durable only If it is linked to a comprehensive resolution of the problem in the Middle East. As is now widely acknowledged, the Palestinian issue is the crux of the problem in the Middle East. It is the view of my delegation that the volatile situation in the Middle East will persist as long as the Palestinians are denied their basic, legitimate and inalienable rights to self-determination and a homeland. Apart from the political, social and economic considerations involved in the Palestinian issue, there is also the intrinsic question of human rights. The human rights of the Palestinians, their right to self-determination, to live in peace in their homeland, their freedom of speech, movement and assembly, their right to prosperity and other civil rights have for long been denied to them, despite several General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the matter. This situation is totally unacceptable. It poses a grave threat to international peace, security and stability, and all efforts must be deployed for their effective and unconditional implementation.\nOur policy position is based on such fundamental principles as self-determination, non-use of force, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and respect for human rights. We are thus supportive of the general view expressed in this Assembly for a comprehensive, just and durable Middle East peace settlement. Israel and its Arab neighbours must also live in peace with each other within secure borders if this objective is to be attained. Any comprehensive peace settlement, therefore, must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of territory for peace. My delegation looks forward to the convening of an international conference on the Middle East in October, under the joint chairmanship of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We hope to see full and active participation by the Palestinians in this peace process.\nI cannot conclude my statement on the Middle East without reference to hostage-taking in the region. The Gambia regards hostage-taking, of any kind, as an act of terrorism and a violation of basic human rights. We therefore call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. We have noted with satisfaction the recent releases and urge the Secretary-General to spare no effort to help obtain the release of all hostages in the region.\nThe dismantling of apartheid is indeed an intricate part of the pursuit of peace, progress and collective security. For apartheid is a threat to world peace and an affront to human dignity.\nTo judge from events of the past year, despite some set-backs, continued international pressure on the Pretoria regime has yielded some positive results. Nevertheless, it is the view of my delegation that this systematic dismantling of the legislative pillars of apartheid does not go far enough. What is urgently required is the practical elimination of apartheid from all facets of South African society and this calls for the enfranchisement of all South Africans. My Government is unreservedly committed to the attainment of this objective. We shall therefore continue to seek the release of all political prisoners, the desegregation of all public institutions and the exercise of full universal adult suffrage. We also look forward to the successful convening of an all-party conference on a new constitution leading to the establishment of a non-racial, united and democratic South Africa.\nThe Abuja Declaration on South Africa adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its twenty-seventh ordinary session spells out clearly the African position on the issue. We look forward to the continued support of the international community for a successful resolution of this vary protracted and vexed problem. We also fervently hope that our brothers and sisters in South Africa will close their ranks and stop the senseless bloodshed that threatens to derail the vital negotiation process.\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year the situation in Liberia was horrendous and the plight of the people of that sister Republic very pathetic indeed. However, with the persistent determination of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOHAS) to find a regional solution to the crisis, the situation has now stabilised and the prospects for a durable solution are far greater now than before. This is largely due to the fact that there is now total commitment to the EC0MAS peace plan by all the States in the subregion as well as the parties to the conflict. I should therefore like to pay a tribute to the members of the ECOWAS Standing Mediation Committee and the Committee of Five on Liberia for their wisdom and determination to resolve the crisis through dialogue and negotiation, in the unswerving conviction that the conflict can be solved only through the democratic process of free and fair elections under international supervision.\nIn this connection, my delegation once again appeals to the parties in the Liberian conflict to continue to observe the cease-fire agreement and to work under the aegis of the ECOWAS peace plan for the restoration of peace and normalcy in Liberia. In the same vein, my delegation appeals to the international community to provide the necessary support and assistance to ECOWAS and its peace-keeping monitoring group (ECOMOG) in Liberia to enable the latter effectively to discharge its responsibilities, which are not only military in nature but also have a humanitarian dimension.\nIncreased attention is now being rightly focused on restructuring and revitalising the United Nations system. This process is aimed at enabling the United Nations to perform better and to be more cost efficient in peace-keeping and in the pursuit of social and effective development, an outlined in the Charter. This issue will engage our constant attention during this session. In consideration of the very analytic and sound positions taken on the matter, after successive consultations, by both the Group of 77 and other regional groups, including the African Group, my delegation is hopeful that with the necessary will the noble objectives we have collectively set for ourselves will be attained.\nEnhancing the role of the United Nations is one thing; making collective security work is another. The latter is the sacred duty of the United Nations, entrusted to it by the Charter. However, this duty can be exercised beneficially and meaningfully only if all Member States, individually and collectively, play their active role in the search for peace. This is what makes for our collective security. It is also the only guarantee to make the new found relevance of the system work for all nations, rich and poor alike. The United Nations has been making a valuable contribution towards resolving long-standing problems such as those in Afghanistan, Cyprus, Western Sahara and Cambodia, and my delegation believes that the efforts of the Secretary-General are highly commendable and deserve our support to ensure a successful resolution of these seemingly intractable conflicts. The Gambia for its part will support these and other initiatives in the guest to attain self-determination, peace and stability the world over.\nThe need to rid the world of all types of weapons of mass destruction nuclear, chemical and biological - and to ensure that mankind's energies and resources are diverted to the improvement of the quality of life here on earth is becoming increasingly desirable and urgent. My delegation is indeed encouraged by the keen attention and considerable time and resources devoted to this issue by the United Nations.\nDevelopments in the international political scene provide a source of hope to many countries, including the Gambia. However, development in the International economic scene, in the process of multilateral trade negotiations, is a source of frustration and disappointment to many countries, including my own. These disappointments and frustrations are not only under review as an agenda item during this session, but have been the subject of detailed comments by speakers before me. I would therefore like to confine my observations to the report of the Final Review and Appraisal on the Implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.\nThat programme gave rise to very high hopes when it was launched four years ago. It was inspired by a good motive - the desire to improve the quality of life of African peoples. It failed to fulfil the hopes placed in it for the following reasons: first, it would seem that the international community only paid lip service to the Programme as the net flow of resources to Africa actually declined during the plan period, 1986 to 1990. Secondly, the programme overlapped with painful structural adjustment programmes, which were implemented at great risks to national political stability. Thirdly - and this is important - the Programme was an attempt to isolate development and growth in the African countries from the global economic scene. It therefore became at beat dysfunctional and inappropriate in its partial setting.\nIt is estimated that by the end of this year world economic output will grow by only 1.2 per cent as compared to 2.1 per cent last year. This implies that our hitherto deteriorating economic condition will inevitably be further exacerbated. Despite the steady improvement in the overall external debt situation, a major concern in Africa, particularly in our sub-Saharan region, is that foreign debt continues to grow faster than income and exports. This situation is clearly unsustainable, particularly when cognisance is taken of the fact that a large part of our current borrowing is simply for the purpose of retiring old debt. It is, therefore, my delegation's view that if this trend continues unabated, external debt will remain a very serious impediment to sustainable growth and development.\nThe need to redress the present economic imbalance requires international collaboration and endeavour. In this regard, my delegation is glad to note that the Group of 7, in their joint communiqu\u00e9, issued in London in July 1991, emphasised not only the need to deal effectively with Africa's debt problem, but also the desirability of encouraging multilateral efforts for sustained economic growth and development. We agree that this calls for a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, the reversal of protectionism, an increase in trade flows and confidence-building initiatives leading to the integration of the economy of our countries into the multilateral trade system.\nFrom the aforementioned perspective one can discern why the Programme of Action was indeed not a panacea for our economic woes. Being bereft of an integrative and global approach, it resulted in compounding our economic problems. This, in essence, was its nemesis. There is now a call for a new pact between Africa and the international community. While urging African\ncountries to pursue sound fiscal, management and investment policies, It calls for the adoption of a new conceptual framework beyond the rigid International Monetary Fund structural adjustment concept. We therefore welcome the proposal of the Government of Japan for a summit meeting with African countries to address Africa's severe economic problems. Ha hope that such a meeting will give a fresh impetus and provide new perceptions of Africa's problems and of the solutions to these problems.\nIt goes without saying that no meaningful and balanced economic development can occur without due regard to environmental concerns. In the realm of human welfare and progress, therefore, the pursuit of economic development and the protection of the environment are inextricably linked. Balanced, meaningful and sustainable development is based on the preservation and protection of a clean and healthy environment. The Government of the Gambia places high priority on environmental issues, particularly the efficient management and utilisation of the Earth's resources, climatic changes, pollution, and the dumping of hazardous substances, particularly toxic wastes, which pose a grave threat to the environment. To arrest, or at least contain, this crisis, it is our view that economic policies should ensure that the utilisation of the Earth's resources is sustainable in the long run. What is needed, therefore, are policies and strategies to preserve and safeguard the environment for the present and future generations. This calls for a collective mobilisation and pooling of our resources and efforts to protect the environment and ensure proper accountability.\nThe Gambia, therefore, looks forward to the successful convening in Brazil, next year, of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In the meantime, we urge the active participation of all Member States in the negotiation and ongoing consultations leading to the convening to this Conference. It la our fervent hope that this important event will be a watershed in our search for an international solution to this man-made ecological problem.\nThe main thread running through my statement concerns the questions of human rights, security, the environment and development. These issues are intricately linked and have been adequately dealt with in the report of the Secretary General on the work of the United Nations. In concluding my remarks, I should like to remind this Assembly of the words of the Secretary-General:\n\\\"No system of collective security will remain viable unless workable solutions are sought to the problem of poverty and destitution, afflicting the greater part of the world.\n\\\"A reinvigoration of the North-South dialogue has now become more urgent than ever. Fortunately, conditions exist now for advancing it constructively without a needless overlay of rhetoric or ideological Controversy.\\\"\nI cannot agree more with these words, and the United Nations as the embodiment of our hopes and aspirations should endeavour to attain these goals. This is the vision set for it by its founders and it is our duty to translate this vision into reality for the welfare of humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, it is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session.\nAs you are aware, Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister, Sir Michael Somare, was a candidate for the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. As a democratic country whose Constitution is based on United Nations principles and practices, we of course accept the collective decision of this body in electing you as its President. We pledge ourselves to working with you during your term of office with much pleasure and gratitude. On the basis of the principle of shared responsibility, we intend to maintain our strong commitment to the United Nations. We will continue to make our modest contribution to the work of the world's highest body.\nAllow me to place on record Papua New Guinea's appreciation for the excellent job accomplished by your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta. Among his pressing responsibilities, he has been instrumental in the ongoing reform exercises at the United Nations, and my delegation commends his contribution to that important development.\nPapua New Guinea's commitment to the United Nations is rooted in our Constitution, which establishes a democratic system of government and protects the basic rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual within the framework of society. Our national Constitution provides for due process of law to ensure that personal liberties are protected by impartial and independent courts of law. Within our constitutional framework, we have established an extensive and working legal system of checks and balances to ensure that executive government is fully accountable to its people.\nThe fundamental provisions of our Constitution embody the ideals and values of democracy, more conducive within our Melanesian practices of consensus in democratic decision-making. We support the processes of democratisation now under way throughout the international community.\nPapua New Guinea welcomes the new Members to the United Nations. Their membership is a clear indication of their support for the increasing importance of the United Nations. We join other delegations in congratulating and welcoming the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as new Members of the United Nations. We also congratulate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Korea and the Republic of the Marshall Islands for their admission as full Members.\nThis is indeed an event of historic Importance for the Governments and peoples of those States, and we join them in celebrating this important and unique occasion. My delegation is particularly proud to witness the admission of two members of the South Pacific Forum, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, because we have contributed towards the process of self-determination and independence for both those island States. We are pleased that the aspirations of their peoples have been realised. Papua New Guinea firmly believes also that the admission of the two Koreas as members of the international community is a significant development in the region. It is our sincere hope that their admission to the United Nations will accelerate and provide an additional avenue for dialogue in the reunification process.\nThe Assembly convenes at a time of rapid change in the global political, economic and social arenas. It is also a period when there is ever-increasing concern for the future destiny of our global environment. These developments have placed the international community in a more precarious position than ever before. Therefore it is vital that this Assembly continue to play a leading role in finding solutions concerning these challenges. In this regard, we welcome the reform exercise that is currently being pursued at the United Nations to improve its effectiveness.\nThe achievements over the years of the United Nations system are commendable, particularly in the areas of decolonization, disarmament, the environment, social justice and the maintenance of world peace and security. My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his strenuous efforts in upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We strongly believe that a strengthened United Nations system is necessary so that it can play a pivotal role in promoting peace and security as well as equitable economic relations between developed and developing countries. Papua New Guinea, since its accession to independence in 1975 and its subsequent admission to membership to the United Nations, has played and will continue to play its part consistent with the underlying principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\nWe ARE encouraged by the positive changes in relations between nations. The marked improvement In East West relations, particularly between the super-Powers, and their combined efforts to find solutions on many of the global issues bring hope and optimism to international cooperation.\nWhile we were alarmed at the recent developments in the Soviet. Union, we are, however, pleased to note the positive developments that are currently taking place in that country. It is our hope that that great country will, through negotiations and dialogue, find solutions to its current difficulties and continue to contribute to international cooperation and development.\nOur region, the South Pacific, is relatively free of major conflicts and tensions. Nevertheless, we are not immune from the effects of external problems elsewhere. The South Pacific Community is comprised of many small island States scattered throughout the vast South Pacific. We largely depend on a limited number of agricultural and marine products for our livelihood and export income. Our struggle is, therefore, one of survival.\nWhile we welcome positive contributions towards the overall development of our region, we also believe that external efforts in this development process should not lead to situations that would threaten our environment, our limited resources and in particular our livelihood.\nFor these reasons, the South Pacific Forum initiated and concluded a number of important, arrangements to safeguard our region and our resources. These arrangements include the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment and the Convention for the Prohibition of Drift-net Fishing in the South Pacific.\nLast year marked the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is also the desire of the United Nations to ensure total eradication of colonialism by the year 2000. Even though the struggle against colonialism has been largely successful, our region still places great importance on the emancipation of the remaining colonial Territories and their peoples around the world, including those in the South Pacific.\nMy country remains committed to the work of the Special Committee on decolonisation to ensure that the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism is effectively implemented.\nMy delegation is particularly encouraged by the measures being taken in New Caledonia by the French authorities under the Matignon Accords, in cooperation with all sectors of the population, to promote equitable political, economic and social development in order to provide a framework for that Territory's peaceful evolution to self-determination and independence.\nWe welcome the willingness of the French Government to allow a South Pacific Forum ministerial visiting mission to New Caledonia this year. Likewise, we further seek the cooperation of the French authorities to facilitate regular visits to New Caledonia by visiting missions of the United Nations to monitor the developments in that Territory.\nMy Government believes that in order to facilitate smooth transition to self-determination and independence, the Administering Authority must enhance opportunities for assistance in education and training, especially for the Kanaka of Hew Caledonia. There are other dependent Territories in the region which must also be given opportunities by the Administering Authorities concerned to achieve self-determination.\nMora than ever before, the environment-related issues have increasingly occupied an important place on the agenda of the United Nations, as well as being of concern to individual countries and regions. The continuing deterioration of our global environment is a matter of grave concern to all of us. If this trend is allowed to continue unchecked, it will most certainly disrupt the global ecological balance and jeopardise the Earth's life-sustaining capacities.\nWe in the South Pacific are alarmed at the changing global climatic conditions which threaten present and future generations with untold economic and social consequences. Therefore we appeal to the world community to consider with the utmost seriousness how we can control global patterns of production and consumption, to avoid the degradation of the global life-support systems.\nThe global warming and climatic changes which are causing rising sea-levels are a direct threat to the very survival of the small island States. In this regard, we commend the efforts of the Association of Small Island States to seek the cooperation of the international community to develop a framework convention on climate change.\nWe firmly believe that international cooperation in the field of environmental protection calls for global multilateral approach so that all aspects of the issue can be considered, while, at the same time, the development priorities of developing countries are retained.\nWe are pleased with the progress being made towards the convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in June 1992. My Government looks forward to constructive and meaningful contributions by participants to ensure that we take collective measures to protect and preserve our global environment.\nPapua New Guinea will continue to work with other member States of the South Pacific Forum in opposing nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear and in our other toxic region. We appeal to the international community to conform to standards prescribed under the London Convention on Dumping as well as the regional safeguard arrangements to which I have referred earlier. These arrangements are important to us for the protection and survival of our region and our people.\nMy delegation is, however, concerned that, despite long-standing opposition by the South Pacific Forum, France continues to carry out its nuclear testing activities in the region. We strongly urge France to consider seriously our concern and take positive measures to put an end to this act of terrorism against the ecosystem and humanity.\nIn this connection, Papua New Guinea welcomes the decision by the Government of the United States to cease the operation of its chemical-weapon incineration facility at Johnston Atoll.\nJapan's recent decision to cease drift-net fishing in our waters is also applauded, and we hope other distant-water fishing nations can make similar declarations soon.\nLasting solutions for some of the current conflicts around the globe constitute the only prerequisite to international peace, security and development. Papua New Guinea welcomes the acceptance by all parties of the framework agreement for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian conflict.\nMy Government believes that the continued involvement of the United nations is necessary in order to ensure the peaceful resolution of the Cambodian problem. By way of a modest contribution, I am pleased to confirm that Papua New Guinea is prepared to participate in any United Nations peace-keeping arrangements in Cambodia.\nMy delegation commends the efforts of the United Nations in working towards a peaceful resolution of the question of Western Sahara in line with the appropriate resolutions of the Security Council. We are, however, disappointed that progress is being impeded owing to the current problems in Western Sahara. We are hopeful that the participating parties will allow dialogue and reconciliation to continue and enable the Sahraouis to determine their own future destiny. The impasse in the search for a solution in regard to the Middle East question continues to concern my Government. We have always maintained that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland as much as Israel has a right to exist within secured borders. We believe these two conditions are fundamental to any lasting solution of the problem.\nPapua New Guinea has, on many occasions, voiced its concern over the institutionalised apartheid system that exists in South Africa. The latest developments in that country are encouraging, and further steps should be taken to accelerate the process of totally dismantling apartheid in all its forms. He acknowledge the pressure exerted by the international community against the racist South African regime, particularly through the adoption of appropriate United Nations General Assembly resolutions and the sustained dialogue between the various political groups in that country. My Government firmly believes that the final eradication of apartheid and an improvement in relations between South Africa and the neighbouring front-line States, as well as the return of the country to a united, non-racial and democratic system, would provide peace and security in the entire region. It is our firm conviction that sanctions should be continued until the apartheid system is completely dismantled. This institutionalized racism, under apartheid, is indeed a crime against humanity.\nThe universality of membership of the United Nations is an important objective of the international community. The realization of social justice and equity for all the peoples of the world must be given equal priority by the world community. The United Nations must therefore place people at the centre of all its activities concerning world peace and security. There is a need for all Member States and international civil servants to make every effort to humanize the institutions of the United Nations system so that they may efficiently and effectively contribute to the improvement of the social conditions of the masses of suffering people throughout the world.\nThe social and political evils of poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, drug abuse, and inequality between men and women and between States are still\nprevalent. In this regard, my delegation would like to appeal to all Member States to lend their support for the proposed world summit for social development, which was endorsed at the session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva this year.\nThere are many changes taking place in the world economy. We observe, however, that these changes in international economic relations have not brought about any fundamental change in the unfair international economic order. The situations regarding external debt, economic growth and the reverse flow of capital remain unchanged.\nThe shift by Eastern European countries towards market-oriented economies, the move towards a single European market, and regional initiatives such as Asia-Pacific economic cooperation can have serious consequences for the developing countries. These problems have been further compounded by continuing global economic recession, inflation, high interest rates, rising unemployment, lack of investment, slow growth and protectionism. All these factors contribute to slow progress and to the stagnation that has a considerable effect on the social and economic well-being of developing countries in particular.\nWe believe that developing countries are deprived of the opportunity to take advantage of the new technological revolution, which has promoted the internationalization of production and finance and has given a new impetus to the growing integration of the world economy. It therefore appears evident that disparities between the developed and the developing countries win continue to grow if the underlying problems are not adequately addressed with a view to enhancing and promoting equitable trade and economic cooperation between the developed and the developing countries.\nMy Government wishes to appeal to the international community to recognise that it is of vital importance that in the ongoing Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations the multilateral trading system, should be fully responsive to the special needs of developing countries, particularly with regard to the consideration of commodity prices and the protection of agro-based and other light industries. He also believe that the Uruguay-Round negotiations should lead to the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement and safeguards based on the basic principle of non-discrimination and on the preservation of the flexibility available to developing countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\nWe in the Pacific depend largely on tropical agricultural export products to raise foreign exchange to meet the needs of our people. We have, however, experienced enormous difficulties as a result of both fluctuating commodity prices and the discriminatory trade policies of some developed nations. In this regard, we join others in the international community in urging all participants in the Uruguay Round to commit themselves to a comprehensive and successful end to the negotiations and to underline the importance of fair trade to all countries.\nPapua New Guinea values its relations with the European Economic Community, particularly under the umbrella of the various Lome Conventions. It is our hope that the current political and economic problems in Eastern Europe and the move towards a single European market in 1992 will not in any way affect the agreed provisions put in place under the Lome IV Convention. We believe that the diverting of development assistant to Eastern Europe will have a negative effect on the economies of the developing countries.\nNever before has the United Nations enjoyed such widespread support for its efforts, and never before have international civil servants been called upon to help guide so many different peoples to peace, democracy and independence. It is a cull to which they have responded with the exceptional talent, experience and dedication that the world has come to expect from them. These tasks are undertaken sometimes at great personal cost to the international civil servants, who chose to uproot themselves and their families for the duration of their assignments. Many have been detained and held hostage during the course of their duties. We call on those responsible to release and free them to their important duties and to their families.\nAs for those who have paid the ultimate price and laid down their lives while working for peace, Papua New Guinea salutes their sacrifice and cherishes their memory. As we move into this session of the General Assembly and towards its probable mandates for more United Nations missions, the independence of the international civil service must be guarded more carefully than has been the case in the past.\nIn conclusion, we wish to emphasize that the aspirations to world peace, and to fair and just development, cannot be realized without political realism and recognition of the dynamics of international politico where narrow political ends of the most powerful States are pursued. International economic and political structures, as they exist today, promote inequality and imbalances. The United Nations cannot, and must not, be used as a legitimizing tool for powerful States utilizing their military arsenals to achieve their narrow political ends.\nThe global humanitarian concern for all States Members of the United Nations is to take positive steps to minimize inequality between nations, and between different societies and peoples within each State. The prime mission of the United Nations, and the challenge of the 1990s, is to move away from rhetoric and make genuine efforts to evolve economic and political structures at the international level that will support development processes capable of securing and enhancing social and economic justice for all. That is the mission for mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. His election to this high office is an acknowledgement of his diplomatic abilities and a tribute to his country, Saudi Arabia, with which Nicaragua has firm ties of friendship. I would also like to express to his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, our appreciation of his successful guidance of our work at the forty-fifth session.\nIt is a privilege for Nicaragua to welcome Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as new Members of the United Nations. Their contribution to strengthening the Organization and their commitment to the aims and principles of the United Nations will help us face the new challenges of international life. \nWe are gathered at this forty-sixth session amid an international situation that can be characterised as the coexistence of achievements, challenges and risks - but a situation which is also full of hope and opportunities. Me wish to report here what we said recently at the session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva: today the changes taking place in the Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe are so profound that they define the beginning of a complex and long period of transition not only for those countries themselves but also for the entire international community. This transition is marked by a gradual change from an age of confrontation to one of cooperation.\nIn the final analysis, we must achieve a firm commitment to freedom, the full observance of human rights, democracy and the establishment of a market economy compatible with justice and social responsibility. Today these objectives are shared by the overwhelming majority of Members of the United Nations, but it must always be kept in mind that each country's cultural and historical differences will result in its own particular characteristics being brought to bear in this political, social and economic transition.\nProgress in the political arena should not lull us into complacency. On the one hand, in the economic sphere we are still facing a multipolar reality in which the developing countries face serious difficulties and, on the other hand, the far-reaching geopolitical changes in various regions of the world, as in the Soviet Union, have not yet entered the phase of definitive consolidation. Similarly, there remains a broad margin for action in disarmament; respect for human rights, transition to democracy, political pluralism and freedom of the individual are still precarious or tentative in many countries; and the developing world is still yearning to secure more just and equitable economic relations with the industrialized countries. \nThe threat of nuclear war has diminished but not disappeared. New threats to world peace are all around us. Mars for religious motives, potential border conflicts, the transnational violence as a result of drug trafficking, ethnic issues and terrorism remain present or latent in various parts of the world. All this underscores the need to revitalise and complete the process of world detente and to seek new forms of action to achieve comprehensive peace.\nOf special concern to Nicaragua is the total military expenditure of developing countries which for 1988 was estimated at 4.3 per cent of their gross domestic product and, between 1960 and 1988, increased at twice the growth rate of per capita income. Distinguished specialists, among them Mr. Robert McNamara, have recently reminded us that during the last 45 years the developing world has seen 125 conflicts and wars, which have left a dreadful toll of 40 million dead. He cannot allow the continuation of such a deplorable situation, and we therefore reiterate today what was said by Nicaragua at the recent Accra ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement on the necessity of definitively prohibiting war among our countries. In addition, we should aspire to achieve a 50-per-cent reduction in military expenditure by the end of this decade, reallocating the resources thus freed to the most urgent social priorities, with the necessary gradual approach, the developed world should proceed similarly, taking advantage of the end of the cold war. \nThere is a general consensus on the extraordinary importance that successfully concluding the Uruguay Sound will have for the future development of the world economy, cooperation and multilateralism, as well as for the future of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAAT) itself. The original aims of the Bound must be maintained and must lead gradually to complementary agreements on external debt, financing of development, macro-economic policies of developed countries, international economic adjustment and monetary cooperation.\nIn this context, we believe that the international agenda should give a prominent place to the question of food security in general as well as a possible system of food assistance in particular, so that we can deal with any negative effects of the gradual application of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round. That was also a recommendation of the World Food Council, which met in Elsinore, Denmark, in June of this year.\nStill on the subject of trade, we believe that the eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, early next year, will provide a valuable opportunity to undertake an objective evaluation of accomplishments, shortcomings and potentials, but above all to turn that body into a more effective mechanism for North-South cooperation.\nWe must, however, be realistic and recognize that if GATT and UNCTAD cannot be strengthened within a relatively short time, we should give serious thought to a possible enlargement of the Bretton Woods institutional framework through the creation of an international trade organization similar to the one envisaged in the 1946 Havana Charter, but in an updated form. In addition to the intensification of the North-South dialogue, Nicaragua attaches special importance to South-South cooperation, especially because of its beneficial effects on regional and complementarity solidarity. This was acknowledged in the excellent declaration approved by the Non-Aligned Movement in Accra, Ghana, this month. In this content, we should like to stress the economic and trade potential of the \\\"Greater Caribbean\\\", composed of Central America, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and the Caribbean countries. That region, with & present population of 166 million, is destined to become in this decade one of the most vital and dynamic regions of the world.\nThe admission of the Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries into the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank could have a negative impact on the amount of resources those institutions allocate for the developing countries. The financial resources provided must therefore be regarded as additional funds and must be clearly differentiated from those earmarked to fight underdevelopment.\nAn extremely important statement was made at the second part of the Economic and Social Council's session this year by the Director General of the IMF, Mr. Michel Camdessus. Be stressed that the present international financial requirements are so great that we should ask ourselves if enough international savings are available to meet the increasing needs of multilateral financial cooperation.\nThe international community cannot disregard commitments already made to or being discussed with the developing countries. One of the most efficient and most direct ways to ensure this is to find more effective and permanent solutions to the external-debt problem, as well as to meet the goal of contributions by the industrialized countries to the official development assistance in amounts equivalent to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product.\nHe support the suggestion made by the Secretary-General that the new international order which is just emerging should be governed by the principles of the Charter. At the same time, we share his concern regarding three realities that narrow the Organization's margin of action: the persistent, although somewhat diminished, tendency not to make use of United Nations mechanisms to solve important problems; the contrast between the increasing number of tasks assigned to the Organization and the financial constraints being faced; and the need to make use of the Organization's capacity for preventive diplomacy. He also support the Secretary-General's proposals as to where the United Nations should concentrate its activities.\nAt this session of the General Assembly Nicaragua attaches special importance to the declaration of Central America as a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development. In the Puntarenas Declaration approved by the Central American Presidents in Costa Rica on 17 December 1990 (A/45/906, annex), the Presidents expressed their commitment to protecting, defending and promoting human rights; to incorporating irregular forces into the mainstream of political life; to doing away with violence; and to bringing about reconciliation in the divided Central American societies.\nA fundamental tenet of the declaration of Central America as a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development is recognition that peace is one, undivided and indivisible. Therefore, the Central American countries have a legitimate concern and a mutual, inescapable duty of solidarity in their efforts to do away with all violent action and terrorism, as well as a commitment to overcome extreme poverty and to promote sustained development as an expression of their basic interdependence and common origin and destiny. Consequently, they commit themselves to the establishment of a new model of regional security.\nNicaragua believes that a new model of regional security can arise only from a law-abiding State, in a democratic society. It is defined by the importance of meeting the basic needs of the population for food, health, education and housing. This implies the eradication of poverty, the culture of violence and the illicit trafficking in drugs and replacing them with development, economic and social justice, and peace-centred education. It implies respect for the dignity of the human person, full observance and protection of human rights, and responsible exercise of freedom with justice. These are values which we should like to see supported for our region by this session of the General Assembly and which Nicaragua put forward at the historic meeting of the Ibero-American countries in Guadalajara, Mexico, this year.\nThe Declaration of Guadalajara constitutes the beginning of a unique process of cooperation and consultation destined to have important effects on the world scene, for it was adopted by 21 countries, with a population of more than 500 million. We are pleased that beginning in 1992 meetings of this forum will take place in Spain, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, to give continuity to this process.\nNicaragua today la a reflection of currant changes in international life. In this process we have been and we remain performers - not spectators. Ha are living daily through our own difficult process of transition towards democracy and a market economy; the former, guided by dialogue, reconciliation, pacification, full enjoyment of human rights and the establishment of the rule of law; the latter, without overlooking social development and equity and without violating the rights of the large majority of the Nicaraguan people regardless of political hue. Reconciliation is a reality in Nicaragua, and it constitutes an effective mechanism that must be strengthened if we are to make democracy irreversible.\nDuring 1991, Nicaragua has been able to consolidate its policy of pacification and demilitarisation by reducing its armed forces to 21,000 troops - the smallest army in Central America - from the 90,000 when President Chamorro took office in 1990. Also, of the 22,000 members of the resistance who were demobilised, more than 20,000 have already been incorporated into the country's normal activities. The Government is making great efforts to satisfy the needs of these two groups through farm programmes, technical assistance and the creation of sources of employment. This also applies to the more than 150,000 refugees and displaced persons who have returned to their homeland.\nThe new Government's first year in office has to its credit other significant accomplishments. A demanding and persevering policy of reconciliation and joint endeavour have made it possible to put an end to hyperinflation through the economic programme begun in March 1991. While prices for more than 30 months had been increasing at a monthly rate of 50 per cent, between May and the end of August 1991 the monthly average increase was only 1 par cant. This result has been attained while keeping within acceptable Units the social costs of adjustment by means of a process of conciliation which provides an equitable distribution among the various income groups of the population. This process includes taking care of those groups most affected by the adjustment, through the implementation of several emergency social programmes.\nThe climate of democracy that Nicaragua enjoys today may be seen, for example, in the full enjoyment of civil liberties, the gradual implementation of the rule of law, the independence of each branch of government and the way in which for the first time in the history of Nicaragua more than 130 municipal governments were elected, took office and now operate. It is evident that there is a gradual return to tranquillity and trust - true pillars for the recovery effort to begin next year.\nThe process of economic recovery will be relatively slow. Nevertheless, it will be firmly anchored in the solution the country has been able to find for the payment of arrears on the pending debt with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank amounting to $360 million. We would like to place on record our appreciation for the contributions made by the Governments of Germany, Austria, Canada, Denmark, the United States, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as for the bridge-loan financing operations undertaken by Colombia, Spain, Mexico and Venezuela. Moreover, Germany, Japan, the Republic of China and Switzerland granted us complementary development loans for this purpose. Thanks to the firm political will and solidarity of the international community in support of reconciliation and reconstruction in Nicaragua, we will in the coming months begin to secure the necessary international financing for our development projects and programmes.\nThe healing of wounds is not easy, especially when they have been the result of political polarisation and war. But we have begun this journey. We have before us an immense task of reconstruction, not only in material terms, but more particularly in moral terms, and we are undertaking this work in spite of very difficult circumstances: our gross domestic product is equal to that at the beginning of the 1950s; the per capita income is estimated at $480; unemployment is estimated at more than 40 per cent; and the external debt, amounting to $12 billion, including the aforementioned figures, is the highest in the world in per capita terms. In addition, a marked deterioration has been noted in the productive and social sectors.\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the attainment of peace in Nicaragua has not been without obstacles. Nevertheless, President Chamorro is firmly committed to the full pacification and democratisation of the country. As an integral part of these processes, the disarming of civilians and the clearing of nines are of special importance. These are tasks for which we have requested the support of the international community and whose importance we reiterate at this time.\nWe all know that peace is not merely the absence of war. Consequently, Nicaragua is committed to the adoption of political measures inspired by economic and social justice that can allow us to lay the foundations for a just, firm and lasting peace and also to participate actively in a serious negotiating process regarding military questions. At the Central American Summit held in Antigua, Guatemala, in June 1990, the Presidents agreed to continue negotiations covering security, verification, control and the limitation of arms and troops. To this end, the Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the region, constituting a commission on security, have already met four times. As a result of these meetings, a kind of inventory of arras and troops has been devised and the decision was taken that each country officially disclose the information. Nicaragua has already disclosed the information to the Organization of American States in May of this year, and intends to disclose it to the United Nations in the immediate future. The commission on security is working on the design of an international mechanism for verification and on the application of a system of maximum ceilings for arms and troops.\nNicaragua considers the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between Guatemala and Belize a very important and highly promising development. Within this context, the first meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Central America and the Caribbean, to be held in November in Honduras, will be a landmark in relations between the two subregions since this will bring about possibilities for cooperation in terms of political understanding, trade, transport and tourism.\nIn the context of the efforts that the Secretary-General has been making to resolve certain regional conflicts, we are pleased at the establishment of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador. We also view favourably the recent efforts of the Secretary-General to find an appropriate solution to this conflict. We have noted, with optimism, the concepts set forth in the important statement made by President Alfredo Cristiani before the Assembly at this session. He are encouraged, too, by the cease-fire in the Western Sahara and by the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a referendum in that part of the world, as well as his latest efforts to find a comprehensive political solution to the problem of Afghanistan.\nThe Government of Nicaragua supports the convening of a peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, We hope that the conference can be convened in the near future.\nWe are in favour of a lasting solution to the problem of Cambodia and the untiring efforts of the two Koreas to achieve a peaceful reunification.\nWe are especially concerned about the serious situation in Yugoslavia. He hope that the efforts of the European Community and the resolution adopted unanimously today by the Security Council will make it possible to lay the foundation for a lasting solution that will respect the self-determination of the Yugoslav people.\nNicaragua supports the legitimate rights of the people of Cyprus to self-determination. It supports also the national unity and territorial unification of Lebanon.\nIn the case of South Africa, we welcome the dialogue and preliminary agreements between the parties to put an end to racial strife, which must eventuate in the establishment of universal suffrage and the adoption of an egalitarian constitution that will guarantee the final eradication of the real structures of apartheid, thereby rendering its legal abolition effective.\nConcerning Africa, we agree with the aforementioned Accra declaration, to the effect that sooner or later the enormous problems of that continent will affect the whole of humanity, and that a world that does not take into account the extraordinary possibilities offered by Africa will for ever be the poorer for it.\nWith regard to the environment and development, Nicaragua supports the principle of equitably shared responsibility, as well as the establishment of a common agenda among the developed and developing countries. We hope to arrive at substantive agreements during the meeting to be held in March of next year here in New York, since it is imperative to secure the success of the Conference in Rio de Janeiro. We reiterate Nicaragua's commitment to the norms and standards of international law, as we begin this year to observe the United Nations Decade of International Law. We also support the possibility of having a summit meeting on social development. At the request of the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General has undertaken consultations on this matter.\nIn the present critical, complex but promising world situation, the peoples of the world have great expectations of the United Nations. We must therefore lend them our support, so that the Organization may be able to play an even more effective role, through a timely restructuring and the strengthening and democratisation of all its bodies. We are convinced that if we are to bequeath a better world to future generations we must arrive at a consensus on the way to update and strengthen our world Organization, placing it at the service of the human race in all its dimensions.\nTo conclude, let us not forget that although the cold war has ended there is still a silent war against hunger, malnutrition, extreme poverty, illiteracy, drug trafficking and unemployment. In the midst of this daily conflict thousands of poor people are dying or are unable to develop their human potential. He must conquer these enemies of progress and civilisation if we do not want to commit a crime against humanity. We can only attain this objective if the international community makes a joint, sustained and coordinated effort to do so. That is our common agenda, in the fulfilment of which the international community will always find Nicaragua in the forefront.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first convey to you, Sir, my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I am confident that your wealth of experience, skill and commitment guarantee a successful session. Your election is also a fitting tribute to your great country, Saudi Arabia, with which Tanzania enjoys excellent relations. My delegation is therefore pleased to pledge its full support and cooperation.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, presided over the deliberations of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly with exemplary skill and dedication. I would like to wish him all the best in his future undertakings.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who has continued to serve the Organisation with dedication and skill. Tanzania renews its support for the Secretary-General and the United Nations he so well serves.\nI am delighted to join in the warm welcome extended to the newest Members of our Organisations the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. As many speakers have observed, their membership in the United Nations brings ever closer our cherished goal of universality.\nThe last four years have witnessed major changes in the international system. The super-Powers have entered a new era of cooperation; and the cold war, which was central to the bipolar division of the international system since the conclusion of the Second World War, is now waning. Within the United Nations there has been exceptional cooperation among members of the Security Council. This cooperation, as symbolised by joint efforts to resolve the most recent conflict in the Gulf, has rekindled the hope that the collective security system envisaged in the Charter, but rendered impotent by the cold war, could now be revived.\nThe signing in December 1987 of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the cooperation of the super-Powers in resolving regional conflicts, the reunification of Germany last year, the agreement on the reduction of long-range nuclear weapons and last week's unilateral United States proposal to eliminate land- and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons have moved United States-Soviet relationships from\nthe cold war to the present climate of mutual trust, confidence and cooperation.\nIn the past two years, significant changes have taken place in our part, of the world, particularly in southern Africa. Following the release of Mr. Mandela and other political prisoners, and the independence of Namibia in 1990, the African National Congress of South Africa and the apartheid regime have been engaging in \\\"talks about talks\\\" concerning the abolition of apartheid. The South African Government has moved to repeal the notorious pillars of apartheid, namely, the Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act and the Land Acts.\nIn short, global and regional developments in the last four years have produced salient features of historic significance to the structure and texture of the international system. They provide the international system with a distinctive emerging order based on universal democratic values.\nMy country has always stood for greater human freedom and development, as demonstrated by our opposition to colonialism, apartheid and all forms of racism, as well as our support for all efforts for development, disarmament and the protection and preservation of the environment. It is for these reasons that Tanzania values its membership in the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77.\nThe existing complex International environment sets the context within which my delegation would like to reflect on the challenges to the international community.\nAlthough the ending of East-West confrontation has fostered greater cooperation in international relations it has not led to a quantum reduction of such major problems as the economic plight of the third world, the eradication of apartheid in South Africa, the attainment of national self-determination for the Palestinians, the return of all occupied Arab territories and the democratisation of the international system. In short, the end of the cold war may have reduced the threats to international peace and security, but it has not eradicated them.\nUntil recently, there existed three major threats to international peace and security, namely, the East-West conflict, the North-South divide and regional conflicts. As ' mentioned earlier, super-Power entente and the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe have greatly reduced the possibility of Soviet-American military confrontation. To a large extent the artificial division of Europe is coming to an end and, with it, we see the emergence of new political priorities and security structures. There is also broad international consensus on the necessity for cooperation to promote ecological security.\nHowever, while the end of the cold war has removed the East-West axis of global politics, it has not brought about the termination of the North-South divide over development, trade and the management of the global economy.\nOne of the major challenges created by the conclusion of classical cold war is the continuing economic plight of the African States, including Tanzania. As super-Power entente and political revolution in Central and Eastern Europe occupy centre stage in the agenda of the industrialized nations, there is a danger that Africa's economic marginalisation will accentuate. While the economic productivity and wealth of North America, Europe and Japan continue to increase rapidly, the economies of African and other third world countries in general are falling behind at an alarming rate. In our increasingly interdependent world the unrestrained poverty of the South is not only contradictory, but untenable.\nThe declining terms of trade exacerbate the problems of the non-oil-producing developing nations to cope with rises in energy prices and interest rates on their debts. For instance, on the average real interest rates were six times higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s, when most African States contracted a large share of their debts. Between 1986 and 1988 alone, the fall of commodity prices and the dramatic deterioration of the terms of trade cost Africa $50 billion.\nIn a seven-year period of the last decade, namely, between 1980 and 1987, the share of the developing countries in the global gross national product fell to 16.8 per cent; yet the third world is the home of two thirds of. the world's population. The July 1990 report of the World Bank, entitled, \\\"Poverty\\\", contends that about 1 billion people in the third world are condemned to live on annual income of less than $370.\nThe last three decades have also witnessed the acceleration of disinvestment in Africa. The continent's share of global foreign investment fell from 5.5 per cent in 1960 to less than 2 per cent by 1990.\nThe debt burden is also heavy on the African continent. Whereas in 1986 the continent had a total debt of $203.7 billion, four years later. In 1990, this had risen to $271.9 billion. Hand In hand with the increase in the volume of debt has been the debt-servicing quagmire, which has risen from 28.6 per cent of the total annual foreign-exchange earnings of the African continent to 40 per cent between 1986 and 1988.\nIt is indeed unacceptable that there continues to be a net capital flow from the developing countries to the industrialized nations. According to a 1990 World Bank report, developing countries paid $27.5 billion more than they received in new credits and grants. Sub-Saharan Africa alone transferred $500 million more than it received.\nCompare this with the total net resource flows to Africa from the countries members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the period 1986 to 1990 - the period of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Net resource flows declined from $25.9 billion in 1986 to $22.6 billion in 1989. In short, the crushing debt burden and the declining foreign-resource flows have contributed to the economic stagnation and decline of the African continent.\nTanzania applauds the decision of those countries that have cancelled debts owed to them. We hope that trend will continue.\nAid conditionalities have been a source of controversy between the donor community and recipient countries. The new conditionally linking aid to political reform exacerbates the controversy. For instance, on 15 April 1991 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established with the\nproviso that the acceptance of multiparty democracy and a free market would be sine qua non for getting aid from the Bank. Tanzania has always supported humanity's quest for freedom, human rights and democracy. However, the linkage between the provision of foreign aid and the implementation of political reforms is undesirable.\nStructural international inequalities are the primary sources of continued third-world poverty. In short, the new conditionally of development aid is unrealistic. It is unrealistic in the sense that the problem of democracy in Africa is much more complex; it is a problem in which the issue of political pluralism is merely one aspect of the much wider question of the transformation of the State and civil society in the African countries. Genuine and stable democracy must be indigenous, and it cannot be imposed from outside.\nI stated in my opening remarks that even without the benefit of historical hindsight, the period since 1988 will be regarded by future historians of diplomacy as a watershed in the history of southern Africa and of South Africa in particular. However, the prospects for a free non-racial and democratic South Africa must not be taken for granted. Despite the repeal of the Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act and the Land acts, the system of apartheid remains Intact and in place.\nIt will be recalled that on 14 December 1989 the United Nations issued a Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in southern Africa. The Declaration lays down 10 fundamental principles which should form the basis of an internationally acceptable solution to the problem of apartheid. It lays down the conditions which the regime must satisfy in order to create the necessary atmosphere for genuine negotiations. It also establishes guidelines for negotiations. And, finally, it draws up a programme of action by the international community.\nWhile a number of preconditions laid down in the Declaration have been satisfied, the regime has still to implement some important conditions. For example, between 30,000 and 40,000 South African exiles remain outside South Africa despite the recent agreement between the regime and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. Similarly, not all political prisoners have been released despite continuing dialogue between the regime and the anti-apartheid forces. Additionally, as long as the present wave of violence continues to sweep the black townships, serious negotiations cannot commence. The regime has an inescapable responsibility to put an end to this carnage. We hope that the peace accord intended to put an end to the violence will hold.\nThe regime pursues a negotiating strategy for the achievement of constitutional dispensation which would remove internal and international pressure against white minority rule while practically leaving apartheid Intact. This strategy dates back to the 1970s and culminated with the 1983 Constitution that set up the tricameral parliament and the 1988 Promotion of Constitutional Development Act to establish a special negotiation forum with African participation. And when this failed to attract black African support, there come the Five Year Plan of Action at the National Party Federal Congress in June 1989 - a strategy skilfully publicised as heralding a new departure in Government policy. This plan forms the official foundation of the apartheid regime's present talks about talks.\nAll along South Africa's strategy has been to seek a negotiated settlement; to seek power sharing without losing it; to entrench the group approach and racist policy characteristic of all previous proposals on constitutional dispensation; to have each group acquire self-determination regarding its own affairs, with joint decision-making on general matters; to have equal formal rights for each group but without the power to dominate or outvote the other groups; to have each group legally protected and retain the power to veto changes sought by other groups; and, lastly, to have a fallback position of being ready to discard almost all forms of traditional policies as long as the whites can still protect their social and economic privileges and prevent the majority from imposing major changes against their will.\nThus, the situation in South Africa is such that while the national liberation movement and other anti-apartheid forces want the power to achieve the complete eradication of apartheid, the Pretoria regime seeks, through a variety of domestic and international measures, to retain power. This partly\nexplains the Pretoria regime's strategy of divide and rule, of fighting the national liberation movement, the African National Congress (AHC), through Inkatha, while talking to it and setting up the so-called black-on-black violence in general.\nTo realise the objectives of the United Nations Declaration mentioned earlier, Tanzania supports the call for the establishment of a transitional government in South Africa that would oversee the election of a constituent assembly to formulate a democratic constitution under which a new South Africa would emerge on the basis of one-man, one-vote. Until this objective has been realised, existing sanctions must be maintained. The consensus United Nations Declaration enjoins Member States\n\\\"To ensure that the international community does not relax existing measures aimed at encouraging the South African regime to eradicate apartheid until there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes, bearing in mind the objectives of this Declaration\\\", (resolution S-16/1. para. 9 (d)\nIn the face of the regime's manoeuvres to thwart implementation of the Declaration, the need for unity on the part of all the anti-apartheid forces is absolutely essential. We therefore welcome the decision of the AHC, the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and other democratic forces in South Africa to form a patriotic front, and wish them every success at their meeting next month. The conflict in the Gulf, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, put to rest any delusions that the end of the cold war necessarily fostered international peace and security. The conflict also demonstrated that effective maintenance of international peace and security requires collective action rather than unilateral action.\nAs a sequel to the invasion, the Palestinian question, which is the primary source of conflict and instability in the region, was relegated to the background. Hone the less, if the faith, trust and confidence of the Palestinian people in the United Nations is to be retained, the same speed and dedication with which the Security Council acted over the Gulf crisis should now be shown in efforts to resolve the Palestinian question, which remains an indictment of the United Nations.\nThe convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East must be the utmost priority of the United Nations. Although the present United States initiative to bring the parties to negotiations is welcome, Tanzania notes with regret that the proposed conference will not fully involve the United Nations.\nThere can be no genuine settlement of the Palestinian question if the Palestinians are denied their legitimate right to choose their own representatives and to participate in the negotiations leading to an agreement. Tanzania therefore believes that there can be no durable peace in the Middle Fast without an agreement on the Palestinian question and the return of all occupied Arab territories. Any proposed talks and any settlement must be based on the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination and must resolve the territorial questions, including those of the Syrian Golan Heights and the status of East Jerusalem, as provided in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It is only in this context that the wider interests of the international community for peace and security in the region will be achieved.\nThe conflicts In the Born of Africa have brought untold suffering and hardship to the people in that part of the world. In this connection, the Government of Tanzania welcomes the new provisional Government of Ethiopia.\nWith respect to Somalia, it is encouraging to see that the Government of Djibouti was able to convene a reconciliation meeting. Tanzania wishes to commend the Government of Djibouti for convening the meeting and hopes that the spirit of reconciliation will continue so that the Somali people can concentrate on the reconstruction of their society.\nIn Liberia, too, we have seen continued conflict. Thousands of people have lost their lives. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) did all it could in search of a peaceful solution. Eventually, the Economic Community of West African States, (ECOWAS) decided to send a peace-keeping force, the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), to Liberia to stop the killings.\nTanzania would like to take this opportunity to commend ECOWAS for the courageous decision taken to send a peace-keeping force to Liberia.\nTanzania has always supported the OAU's efforts to resolve intra-African conflicts by peaceful means. It is the hope of my Government, therefore, that in settling their internal conflicts, both Ethiopia and Somalia will do so peacefully and will decide the future of their countries in a manner compatible with the aspirations of their peoples and those of the African continent as a whole.\nTanzania supports the advancement of genuine democratic reforms, for history has demonstrated that citizen participation in the national life is a precondition for human development. However, to be meaningful, measures for enhancing national democracy must be both indigenous and, at the same time global. Reforms must be indigenous because only in this way can democratic values be sustained. The process of restructuring must be global in the sense that there must also be democratisation of international relations, especially interactions within the United Rations system which are evidently the fulcrum of world politics.\nAlthough super-Power convergence is a welcome development, and in a sense a prerequisite for the success of the United Nations in its present form, this entente equally poses new challenges for the international community. Because of their global and geopolitical interests, the super-Powers, locked into confrontation at times, played an obstructionist role in the United Nations. Yet, the newly found cooperation also poses the spectre of unipolarity which could, in turn, endanger the demonetisation of international relations.\nIf democracy is good at the national level, it must be good at the international level. There must, therefore, be the democratisation of international politics by reforming the United Nations system, including the financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The promotion of a new international economic order is a prerequisite for genuine democracy.\nIn this process of the democratisation of international relations, regional organizations and movements have a special role. This underscores the special importance of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement was born at the height of the cold war. This Movement has helped to de-Europeanise international relations; transcend the bloc mentality, enabling the non-aligned nations to develop their role as full participants and as mediators in a world normally presented as East or West; transform the International diplomatic agenda from military and security issues alone to wider questions of international economic order, including ecological and humanitarian issues; and de-emphasise the East-West conflict and confine the main theatre of the cold war to Central Europe.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement must, therefore, be credited for opening the way to communication and cooperation among nations separated by a profound ideological divide, and for demonstrating that multilateral diplomacy is, indeed, the singular art of producing complex answers to questions arising from humanity's quest for freedom, security, independence and economic development.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement continues to be relevant to us in the post-cold-war international system: in the first place, to enhance South-South political and economic cooperation; secondly, to represent third-world aspirations in world bodies, especially at the United Nations; thirdly, to fend off undue external interference in the internal affairs of third-world nations in a unipolar world; fourthly, to promote collective self-reliance as a basis for international cooperation; and, lastly, to promote South-South solidarity and coordination in all international negotiations.\nAfter examining the state of international relations in the past few years as a result of the thaw in East-West relations and other developments, I can fairly conclude that the international system is in a state of transition to a new system for which the world community had better be prepared. That a new world order must emerge is undoubtful. But it is obvious that this new world order must be built on the principles of justice and equity, on the right of peoples to self-determination, on the sovereign equality of States,\non respect for the territorial Integrity of nations, big and small, on non-interference in the internal affairs of States, on freedom of choice and freedom from want in the process of political, social and economic development and on respect for international law.\nTanzania is quite encouraged by the improved international political climate, and history has demonstrated that nothing is insurmountable when there is political will.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Fiji, I should like to congratulate Ambassador Samir Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. We are confident that his long experience and well-known diplomatic skills will ensure a successful outcome to this important session. Following the momentous events in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and elsewhere over the past year, there is a need for healing and reconciliation as never before, a role for which he is eminently qualified. In his important responsibilities, my delegation pledges him our full support and cooperation.\nHis Excellency, Mr. Guido de Marco, deserves our thanks and appreciation for the dynamic manner in which he guided the work of the last session. He demonstrated untiring patience and thoroughness in seeking new methods to rationalize and reform the Organization. We trust that the momentum of his work will be carried forward. We take this opportunity to wish him all success in the new role which his nation, Malta, will assign to him in the future.\nThis year brings to an end the tenure in office of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. My delegation joins others in congratulating him on a job well done and extends the support of Fiji to his successor.\nI should like to extend a warm and cordial welcome to all seven new Members of the Organization and especially the two from the Pacific - the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Having participated actively in their decolonization process, my delegation is gratified at this final expression of their coming of age.\nIt is a matter of great pleasure for us to join others in seeing both the Koreas as Members of the Organization. Their entry highlights the values which have come increasingly to dominate world thinking - dialogue, cooperation and accommodation. This trend is most encouraging and we urge all nations in conflict to use these attributes in place of armed conflict. \nThe dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have at last enabled a half-century-old wrong to be righted. We congratulate Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on the success of their courageous struggle for self-determination and for their admittance to membership of the United Nations.\nThe International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism is the final countdown during which we hope to see efforts focused on the achieving of self-determination by the remaining 18 Non-Self-Governing Territories. The people of those Territories must exercise their inalienable right to choose their futures free from any outside Interference. We must honour their choice, be it independence, integration, free association or any other acceptable outcome of a legitimate act of self-determination. Fiji particularly looks forward to the results of the 1998 referendum In New Caledonia and will pay close attention to all preparatory acts that lead up to that event. This includes close monitoring of the actual progress of the various phases of the programme of action agreed to be undertaken under the Matignon Accords.\nThe events of last August in the Soviet Union sent out waves of trepidation to the four corners of the globe. We were heartened to see the success of the forces for greater freedom and transparency. We join others in expressing the hope that glasnost and perestroika will go from strength to strength.\nThe political developments in South Africa can, we trust, be built upon and accelerated to dismantle apartheid and allow all the people to have an equal say in the running of their government in their homeland. We commend the members of the African National Congress for their patience and fortitude throughout the years and look forward to the day when their dreams and aspirations will become a reality.\nThe enormous toll on human suffering and material devastation caused by the Gulf War is a severe indictment on those who precipitated the crisis. Such conflicts have no place in this day and age. Today, efforts to alleviate the suffering and reconstruction are being hampered by the non-cooperative stance of certain nations.\nIt is our hope that the final outcome will take into account the needs of everyone, including those of the long-suffering Kurds. The Gulf crisis has clearly demonstrated that the United Nations can respond speedily and effectively to any international conflict, but the process by which this responsibility is exercised must be worked out very carefully.\nA major security concern of small States was made manifest in the invasion of Kuwait. Size, economic well-being and geographical location have not deterred potential aggressors. However, those factors and political expediency have in the past dictated the way the international community has responded to such acts of aggression. Small island States are particularly vulnerable under these circumstances, where their isolation and a lack of economic and strategic value favours the aggressor. We therefore believe that the response of the United Nations and the international community should not be slowed down or obscured by such factors.\nWe welcome the proposed Middle East peace conference and the role of the United States in facilitating the promotion of discussions on the long-outstanding problems and finding solutions that can bring peace and stability to the region. We believe that all parties affected should participate and should address the two major issues of a homeland for the Palestinian people and the recognition of the rights of all States, including Israel, to an existence safe from threats to their territorial integrity.\nHe are much encouraged by the positive manner in which the Government of Lebanon has expanded its authority to regain sovereignty over all its territory. We call upon Lebanon's neighbours to assist it every step of the way to promote the establishment of a new order that can bring to an end the sad history of civil unrest and misery which for far too long has been passed off as intractable. We believe that all foreign military forces, including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), should have no reason to remain in the country and should withdraw when Lebanon assumes control of its own affairs and UNIFIL's mandate is seen by all the parties to have been fulfilled.\nUNIFIL is one of the 10 current peace-keeping operations that the Organization has spread out across the globe. United Nations peace-keeping operations, which have played a major role in many areas of tension, are expanding their scope to include conflict resolution and the mounting of missions new to their traditional agenda. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), which was established to play a supervisory role, is one such operation, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) will break new ground. Notable among the Organization's recent peace-keeping achievements is the success it has enjoyed in electoral assistance. The United Nations responses to requests from Nicaragua and Haiti have contributed enormously to the successful outcome of the electoral processes in those two countries. That experience, we believe, should be readily available to all Members on request, provided that the Governments making such requests have the backing of the majority of the population.\nThe good will and efforts of the Organization in peace-keeping amount to nought without reciprocal action by the host country to mirror efforts. We urge all parties to conflicts to demonstrate the good will necessary to produce good results. The success of such operations is also dependent to a large extent on the financial support of the Members of the Organization, whom we urge to ensure that their assessed contributions are paid in full and on time. The UNIFIL cumulative assessed shortfall as of 31 July 1991 of $297.6 million is illustrative of the unsatisfactory manner in which these payments are being met and, as the Secretary-General has repeatedly pointed out, imposes an unfair burden on those supplying peace-keeping forces.\nWhile we appreciate the heavy burden of responsibilities the United Nations is asked to bear in all fields, we also wish to associate ourselves with those who believe that the time has now come when the Organization needs to examine more closely its current range and method of operations with a view to reducing duplication of work by its various organs and agencies. At a time when national governments are finding that operational funds and resources are becoming increasingly scarce, it is incumbent on the membership to see how the multifarious operations of the United Nations can be further rationalized. Important changes and economies have already been instituted by the Secretary-General, but these need strengthening and reinforcing so that more resources are available at the operational level to make a real impact on the lives and welfare of those in need.\nNext year the Earth summit in Brazil brings to a culmination the considerable amount of effort being undertaken to harmonize human activity with the need to safeguard the environment. My country supports the excellent work being done in many countries on the conservation of the environment and on sustainable development. Left unchecked, the effects of global warming would be disastrous. The melting ice caps would cause sea levels to rise and many Pacific island nations could be wiped out completely. Climatic changes would also alter weather patterns and more floods and droughts will occur. Fiji looks forward to tangible and effective controls being agreed upon at the Earth summit, so that future generations can be protected before it is too late. In our own way, environmental management programmes have been started in Fiji. In order to ensure a continuous supply of timber and to help minimize the \\\"greenhouse effect\\\" our reforestation programme has been expanded. Introductory work on the better management of our watersheds is being undertaken. Environment impact studies are insisted upon for all major development projects to ensure that negative consequences are eliminated. The Brazil Conference and the ultimate \\\"Agenda 21\\\" will provide both the guidelines and the means for the future, which should be adhered to by all of us.\nWhile no one can deny that the question of the environment is an issue that must concern everyone, we maintain that much of the degradation that is with us now is the result of excessive and uncontrolled practices of the industrialized nations, and they should bear the burden of overcoming this problem; and ways should also be found to compensate the developing countries when they are asked to surrender a source of their income because of some imposed boycott.\nNevertheless, as charity begins at home, it is incumbent upon the developing countries to be vigilant and to ensure that in their quest for development they do not inadvertently overlook the environmental management aspects of their programmes.\nLimited natural land resources means that the major drive for the future economic development for Fiji and other Pacific island countries must come from our seas and oceans. The reefs and the near-shore resources in the heavily populated areas are already over fished. The tuna resources in our region are considered to be adequate to support the economic growth of the small islands for years to come, provided they are economically utilized by the people themselves. However, the widespread use of driftnet fishing has caused over fishing beyond maximum sustainable yields. He urge support for the proposed moratorium in all regions of the world on all large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas by June 1992,\nWe also continue to note with concern the ongoing attempts to convert our region into a dumping ground for toxic and hazardous wastes. The alarm sounded by the Pacific nations about the chemical destruction facility at Johnston Atoll elicited a commitment from the United States to keep us informed of its operations and to close the facility on completion of the destruction of weapons being transferred from Europe. We hope that this dialogue will continue and that the facilities are not used again once the present stockpiles are destroyed.\nThis cooperation by a major Power gives us assurance that future talks on matters of mutual interest will receive attention. He must, however, also mention our disappointment at the continued nuclear tests in our region by France, despite repeated calls for them to stop. In this regard, we would like to echo the words of Mr. Bailey Olter, President of the Federated States of Micronesia and current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum, when, in addressing the Assembly on 26 September, he said:\n\\\"We still await, however, a cessation of their testing of nuclear weapons in our region. As Forum Chairman, I cannot overstress the determination of all the members to persevere with ... our efforts to reach the consciences of those who seem willing to visit the potentially devastating consequences of nuclear testing on faraway island people but are unwilling to carry out such activities within their own homelands.\\\" (A/46/PV.5. pp. 7 and 8-10)\nOur concerns on this matter are very real for a very good primary reason, which is: we live there. The recently announced initiative by President Bush further to reduce nuclear weapons represents a significant change in United States nuclear strategy. We commend his bold action and welcome the positive response by President Gorbachev. This should be emulated by all the nuclear Powers.\nFiji went through a period of political turbulence in 1987 and an Interim Government was appointed and assigned to restore the economy and to formulate a new Constitution. The economy has been restored, and we acknowledge the support extended by many nations and international organizations. We have been able to find additional markets and make new trading arrangements. The economy has been deregulated, with emphasis on exports. Tax-free zones were introduced, attracting substantial foreign investment. New industries were established, creating many new employment opportunities. More goods were produced and exported so trade revived. It is no exaggeration to say that the economy rebounded to record levels, thereby achieving the first objective.\nAfter lengthy and extensive consultations with all component groups throughout the country, a new Constitution was promulgated on 25 July 1990. The redefinition of electoral boundaries has been completed. Registration of voters is progressing well, with elections scheduled for March 1992.\nThe last four years have been difficult for my country. Ho change is easy to accept; there will be detractors and there will be those who wish to retain the old system. We have consistently stated that the solutions to our problems will have to be found from within. Outside interference and unsolicited advice do not help. We would like to thank our friends who have given us understanding and who have stood by us in our time of need. Next year a Government elected by the people will assume office to guide our affairs and help us embark on a new chapter of our history.\nThe uncertainties in the global economic environment create a great deal of concern to developing countries. These countries need assistance to develop their economic bases and to find markets for goods produced. They must export to prosper, but they meet numerous hurdles in trying to gain access to markets in the industrialised economies. Non-tariff barriers remain a major impediment to freer trade. Subsidies paid by developed countries to their farmers seriously undermine the ability of developing countries to gain more lucrative and stable markets. Attempts by various groups during the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations to ease these subsidies have met with strong opposition.\nAt the same time, the continuing damage to the interests of countries caused by the failure of the multilateral system to deal effectively with the trade distorting impact of agricultural subsidies underlines the need for urgent reform. Despite repeated attempts to reduce support, transfers to agriculture by way of direct payments and consumer transfers to countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development had increased by 12 per cent in 1990 to $299 billion. The Uruguay Round must be brought to a substantive conclusion and provide a proper basis for a more liberalized international trading system. This liberalization, in itself, would assist greatly in strengthening the economies of member countries.\nCloser to home, the island-developing countries, of which Fiji is one and which are widely recognized as the most fragile and vulnerable of all the developing countries, continue to find themselves in a particularly difficult position. There are over 20 island-developing countries and territories in the Pacific subregion, scattered over an enormous geographical area. Most of them are small and some are tiny, both in their physical size and in population, and natural disasters are frequent occurrences. Four are within the least developed country category. Their links to the outside world are few and poorly developed; these links are highly expensive to maintain but without them they could not survive. They are heavily dependent on outside sources for the supply of many essentials, having very few resources and negligible productive capacity themselves.\nReduction in development assistance will have serious economic repercussions for our island region, where many countries experience budget deficits. Although some have been able to reduce their deficits, the attempts of others have been handicapped by natural disasters, notably hurricanes and cyclones. If assistance is reduced, these deficits might rise further. Moreover, unpredictability in future aid flows will hamper the region's attempt to finance badly needed infrastructure development. This, in turn, might lead to a reduction of capital outlays and general economic decline. We hope that the commitment made by our traditional donors and various United Nations and non -governmental agencies will continue to help alleviate this decline so that these particularly disadvantaged countries can achieve a comfortable degree of economic self-sufficiency.\nThe United Nations has now laid plans to prepare itself for the next century: the 1992 Earth summit meeting, the decade to eradicate colonialism, and diversification of peace-keeping operations are but three significant items. All these will remain beacons to guide us for generations to come. They require the full support of everyone, to ensure their fulfilment. The United Nations remains the bastion of hope that its founders set it out to be, and Fiji remains committed to play whatever role the Organization may call upon it to perform.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe enter the post-cold-war era inspired by the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, which are enshrined the right to self-determination of peoples, respect for their human rights, and the ultimate goal of peace and international security. The recent movements towards political democratisation in Eastern Europe, and indeed throughout the world, highlight the desire of man to live in peace, harmony and cooperation. They inspire hope for a freer society and an even better future for the generations yet unborn.\nIn the midst of this prospect for global peace, in certain parts of this planet Earth, the tragedies of war are blatantly evident, where misery, poverty, hunger, disease and economic decline are tearing apart the fabric of society.\nThe United Nations is called upon to answer the challenges that emerge with these changing times, in accordance with the principles promulgated by the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe delegation of Belize extends its sincere tribute to Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. He are confident that his consummate diplomatic dexterity, which has distinguished him in this family of nations, will lead to the successful deliberations of the session. My Government recognizes the role of Saudi Arabia in the League of Arab States, the Islamic Conference, the Non-Aligned Movement, and indeed in the international community. \n\nMy country, Belize, is proud, and I am honoured, to serve as Vice-President during the forty sixth session of the General Assembly. \nMy delegation salutes Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, who presided over the forty-fifth session with wisdom, vigour and dedication, responding to a rapidly changing world.\nWe hold the highest esteem for the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who hails from our region and who continues to lead this dynamic Organization with determination and conviction in the global guest for peace and cooperation among all peoples. His peace-making efforts are bearing fruit in many parts of the world.\nThis Organization is today enriched by the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the three Baltic States - the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We welcome them to this great family of nations and encourage their contribution to advancing the principles of the United Nations. Belize joins other delegations in extending congratulations to them at this crucial juncture in their history and pledges full support to work closely with the newly admitted States.\nForty-five years ago, the United Nations was born of the pursuit of peace and international security. This great institution has steered the course for societies where there is respect for the human person, where equal opportunities are available and where the dignity of man is upheld. But we are still faced with new challenges and uncertainties which emerge after the years of conflict. Our universal interest lies in our search for peace, freedom and justice.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when confrontation between the super-Powers has turned to cooperation, when a\nnew world order is being shaped and when economic reforms are replacing the trade barriers and protectionism of industrialized economies.\nTen years ago the Prime Minister of Belize stood in this Hall on the occasion of the admission of Belize to this Organization. It was a momentous occasion in the fulfilment of the Belizean people's right to self-determination. After years of diplomatic struggle, Belize finally stood before the world community as an independent nation with a Constitution which acknowledges the supremacy of God, faith in human rights and fundamental freedoms and commitment to the promotion of international peace, security and cooperation among all nations.\nYet there was one nation which did not accept our independence and sovereignty because of an ancient dispute of a bygone colonial era. A decade has now passed and one civilian Government in Guatemala has been succeeded by another. The recognition by the Government of President Jorge Serrano of the independence and sovereignty of Belize, followed by the establishment of full diplomatic relations between our two countries a few weeks ago, on 11 September, marks the beginning of a new chapter in the relations between our two countries. It ushers in a new era of a relationship based on mutual respect, equality, dignity find cooperation. The decision of my Government to adopt maritime legislation which extends our territorial sea to 12 miles while maintaining the existing three miles territorial sea in the southern waters of Belize removes a source of potential friction and guarantees Guatemala's access to the Caribbean. It is our firm conviction that this process clears the way for the final phase of reconciliation, while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both our countries. \n\nA major step has been taken for peace and stability in our region. The climate for more development and the economic advancement of our people will be enhanced by this pragmatic approach to the solution of our remaining differences. Belize is now able to take its rightful place as a Caribbean nation In Central America.\nMy Government is grateful to the international community for the support for the agreement expressed by several delegation during this general debate. In view of this achievement, we commit ourselves to continuing the peace process and Integration of our region and beyond, in pursuance of the Esquipulas II Agreement.\nThe broad agreement reached between the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the FMLN, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, is an indicator that advances in the social and political life of El Salvador may lead to the end of the civil war, and indeed to peace throughout Central America.\nThe Government of Belize supports the decision of the Organization of American States (OAS) to isolate the military junta which overthrew the democratically elected Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti. My Government lends its support, too, to the resolution which calls for the suspension of economic, commercial, diplomatic and military assistance to the military junta and for the full restoration of democracy in Haiti.\nWith regard to another area in our region, Belize would like to see the resolution of differences between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba through peaceful negotiations.\nMy delegation is heartened at the initiatives in South Africa towards a non racial society. We are particularly pleased at the continuation of \nnegotiations by the South African Government and the African National Congress. Bellas, however, scoffs at the racial structures still in place and supports earlier calls by the international community for their complete removal and dismantling. Me stand at. the threshold of the twenty-first century with renewed conviction that all men are created equal. The decades of suffering of the black population of South Africa cannot continue. It is time to end the senseless slaughter of our brothers and sisters. It is time for a society freed of hate.\nThe Middle East continues to be volatile and an area of grave concern. It is our sincere hope that the peace conference to be convened this month will succeed, that international law will be applied, that the aspirations of the people of that region will be fulfilled, and that the relevant United Nations resolutions will be implemented.\nThe plight of the Palestinian people continues to heighten the already explosive region and worsens the prospects of peace and justice. Their right to a homeland must be established in any agreement in the search for a long lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Once again, the fundamental principles of the Charter for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the self-determination of peoples must be put to work.\nWe would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the noble task of the Secretary-General in exerting ardent efforts for the release of the remaining hostages in Lebanon. We pray for their early release.\nThe children continue to be the key element in the social development of our societies. One year ago the world community gathered here for the first\nUnited Nations World Summit for Children to promote strategies to ensure their survival, protection and well being, A few weeks ago the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that, though world leaders had made an encouraging start, a high level of public vigilance Is still needed to meet the commitments to the 27 goals set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \nLet us intensify our efforts and devote our energies to eradicate hunger and the social evils that threaten the family unit and the survival of future generations. Let us resolve to improve the quality of life and totally eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, the mothers of our children.\nPublic concern and awareness for the protection of the environment have heightened in the past years from the emergence of \\\"earth patriotism\\\". Work has already begun on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development that is to take place in Brazil next year and that will consider such issues as climate change and biological diversity. Belize welcomes the results of the Second World Climate Conference and the Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depletion, but we are aware that efforts must be stepped up to prevent environmental degradation.\nThe successful conclusion of the 1992 Conference and the adoption of a plan of action require a global consensus to deal effectively with the degradation and depletion of the environment. The solution to the common problems of poverty, overpopulation and the lack of technology, coupled with the consumption of industrial waste, will require new and innovative approaches and other mechanisms for the preservation of God's gift to mankind.\nBelize is committed to the great task of protecting the survival of man's natural heritage. My Government has just put in place impressive legislation to regulate activities that affect the environment, including the protection of wildlife, the establishment of national parks and reserves, the regulation of land, and the control of pesticides. In this regard, Belize is the proud home of the second largest barrier reef in the world. Its preservation is vital. It is not only for Belizeans to enjoy and its loss would be felt \nglobally. International assistance is necessary if we are to protect this heritage of man and the biodiversity that goes with it.\nIn the social sector, the issue of environment is being integrated into national life. At present the study of the environment is being included in the school curriculum.\nOur efforts towards this global challenge oust extend beyond our political borders. Belize has therefore articulated its environmental policies in line with other Caribbean countries which share similar environmental concerns.\nConcern over the production, traffic in, and use of drugs continues to increase in this global community as this plague becomes one of the major causes of crime and destruction in our societies. This scourge that afflicts indiscriminately, transcending borders, must be addressed in concert. In Belize, my Government is utilizing all resources to control drugs and psychotropic substances and to combat traffickers. Belize has also reached agreements with the United States of America and Mexico in the war against this threat to humanity. Belize calls for concerted action to eradicate the production and use of drugs. He strongly applaud the establishment and the ideals of the international drug control programme of the United Nations.\nAs regards the world economy, Belize is one of the few countries in our hemisphere that is showing sound economic growth. The economic position of the other developing countries has deteriorated despite a noted increase in world trade. There has been a marked increase in foreign direct investment in the past few years, but the share to developing countries has been reduced.\nThe debt crisis has placed an extra burden on the economies of developing countries, which are experiencing a net outflow of resources. The external \ndebt of developing countries has peaked to a staggering $1.2 trillion. The effects of this have bred instability, increased poverty and misery, and generally deteriorated the quality of life.\nThe reactivation of economic growth can best be achieved through a dynamic trading system that will allow exports of goods from developing countries to the markets of the industrialized countries, the restructuring of indebtedness, increased lending from creditors, and increased foreign investment flows. Creditor nations must bear the responsibility to provide more financial resources to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank if the economies of the poor countries are to be transformed. International development finance is needed to help the economies of smal1 and poor States.\nWe are heartened at the efforts of the international community to press for the success of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\nThe shaping of a new world order in the aftermath of the cold war gives us a renewed opportunity to remove the old causes of war. Hunger, poverty, disease, illiteracy and social justice must now be tackled in earnest. The information and communications revolution serves only to inform poor sick people that medicines and cures exist which they can never afford. There is now an urgent need to bring the state of the art in medical technology to all peoples wherever they live. It is disappointing for us to be informed by satellite television and magazines of the most modern technology, which we can never hope to obtain.\nThe experiment in the Soviet Union has shown us that the forces of oppression cannot conquer the indomitable human spirit. This is the era of\n\ndemocracy and the empowerment of peoples everywhere. Clasnost must be accompanied by perestroika order for people to benefit fully. Democracy must work hand in hand with sustainable economic development so that, the quality of life can be Improved.\nDemocracy cannot flourish on economic development alone. More attention must be focused on arms limitation and disarmament.. Greater vigilance with regard to the reduction of nuclear weapons and greater support of the Treaty on the Non-Pro1iferation of Nuclear Weapons by the international community could lead to the eventual destruction of weapons of mass destruction. In this connection, Belize welcomes both President Bush's recent Initiatives to reduce nuclear arsenals further and the response by\nPresident Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union to match the reductions.\nThe reduction of military expenditures estimated at $1,000 billion must, be a priority of developing countries.\nRadical changes the world over are making new demands on the role and work of the United Nations. The climate of today is far different from that of 45 years ago when the United Nations was born in response to super-Power rivalry. To den 1 more effectively with these now circumstances, reform and strengthening of the United Nations must be carried out to ensure that decisions taken reflect the will of the majority of Member States. The General Assembly then is the forum where every individual Member State has an equal right of vote.\nIt is our hope that in this body we will find the strength to meet the challenges of a new world order. May God bless our efforts.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis year the General Assembly holds its forty-sixth session in a world that has undergone a historic transformation. Various events that have occurred since the last session of the Assembly have generated in humanity a new atmosphere of hope for the United Nations, which, to be sustained, will require equally momentous decisions by our Organisation to create a better world for mankind.\nI take singular pleasure in welcoming the seven new Member States to our family of nations. Their presence among us will enrich our Organisation and land credence to the universality of the United Nations.\nThe emerging new world order will remain on a shaky pedestal as long as the task of reducing the world's arsenals of war and mass destruction - a vestige of the cold war - remains the exclusive responsibility of the super-Powers and not the universal concern of the international community as a whole. We need a new strategy for disarmament, one which would involve global negotiations on the balanced reduction of all categories of arms, including conventional armaments.\nWe view as another positive measure requiring urgent international support and encouragement the proposal for the early establishment of an international register of arms sales under the aegis of the United Nations,\nThe Government of the United States deserves our congratulations for carrying a step forward the ongoing process of gradual super-Power disarmament through a bold programme of unilateral measures, announced recently by President Bush. We equally applaud the reciprocal positive response thereto by President Mikhael Gorbachev. We hope that this move will add new impetus to the international efforts to create a world that is free of weapons of mass destruction.\nAlthough the end of the cold war has opened up new horizons for world stability and cooperation and diminished the dangers of global conflagration, situations flowing from the old era still remain which, if met with complacency, will continue to threaten peace and security and to undermine the universal character of the new world order.\nAs we cast our eyes towards Asia, we see in Cambodia a country that has suffered a decade of vicious fighting and the frustration of stalled peace talks. Ha welcome and encourage the peace initiatives of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Me applaud the United Nations framework document of 1990 which was endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 668 (1990). It is our belief that a solid foundation has now been laid for the holding of United Nations supervised elections scheduled for next year which will, it is hoped, definitively contribute to a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Cambodian problem.\nEvents in the Middle East continue to highlight the urgency of the early convening of the peace conference on the Middle East. The world is eagerly awaiting the moment when the people of the Middle East - Arabs and Israelis alike - will join the rest of mankind in building a new world order based on reconciliation, tolerance, cooperation and security for all.\nLesotho fully supports the peace initiatives that are being pioneered by the United States, which appear to have won the backing of all the Arab States in the region. We call on the State of Israel to be part of this process of peace and reconciliation.\nThe developments in Lebanon and Western Sahara have raised some hope that the restoration of peace and stability is within reach, thanks to the patient and untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and of the Organization of African Unity. We hope that similar success will be realized in Liberia and in the Horn of Africa in the near future.\nOur region in southern Africa has not lived in isolation from the current international climate of peace and reconciliation. Diplomatic efforts in Angola and Mozambique, however tenuous, have made breakthroughs that put the people of these sister countries on a firm path towards peace, stability and national reconciliation.\nWe remain concerned, however, at the unpredictable and volatile situation in South Africa. The uncertainty generated by the continuing widespread violence has been compounded by the faltering progress towards negotiating a constitution for a truly democratic South Africa. Although the legal bedrock of apartheid has been smashed through the repeal of a series of discriminatory laws, substantive obstacles remain in the way of making the end of apartheid a tangible reality for the people of South Africa. It is only when a constitutional framework is arrived at, giving full voting rights to the majority population in South Africa on the basis of one-man, one-vote in a unitary nation State, that the world and the people of South Africa will regard apartheid as dead and buried.\nWe urge all the relevant parties in South Africa, in particular President De Klerk and the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political formations, to regain the momentum of the initiatives set in motion since February 1990 and to live up to the responsibilities of their historic mission for the future of South Africa.\nThe new world order of peace and cooperation carries with it not only new opportunities but also newly defined responsibilities and obligations for the international community. It entails a new agenda and a collectively held vision which we must consciously consolidate in order to make its aims and values universal.\nWe believe that the new world order must be one that gives equal opportunity and security and that protects the legitimate interests of all States, irrespective of size or ethnic Identity. It must be based on universal respect for the rights and freedoms of all individuals and be positively disposed towards a just distribution of the benefits of civilisation,\nA global consensus has already emerged on the merits of popular participation in economic and political decision-making as a starting point for world stability and a foundation for a prosperous world free from national and regional conflicts.\nMany nations - especially those in Eastern and Central Europe and in Africa - are today marching on the road to democracy. This is an experiment of momentous significance that requires due support of and nurturing by the United Nations.\nOur Organization has always recognised the right of peoples to self-determination. Thus, for democracy to take root it is imperative that it should not be a coercive prescription from outside, but a culmination of a people's free will from within.\nCentral to the success of democracy in those of our countries with party-political pluralism is the question of a free and fair election. The United Nations, by virtue of its prestige and neutrality, is uniquely placed to assist electoral processes in emerging democracies through activities ranging from observance of * he elections to the provision of technical assistance. Accordingly, my delegation fully subscribes to General Assembly resolution 45/150, adopted at the last session, entitled, \\\"Enhancing the effectiveness of the principle of periodic and genuine elections.\\\"\nI wish to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that preparations are advanced for the holding of democratic elections and the return to civilian rule in Lesotho during 1992.\nThe recent bloody coup in Haiti culminating in the overthrow of a democratically elected Government Is a dangerous precedent for the survival of emerging democracies. The United Nations is in duty bound to act and stand firmly in opposing this and similar threats to democratic order and constitutional legitimacy.\nIt is our hope that under the new world order the norm of popular participation and democracy will include an international dimension that will promote the need to build an international economic and political system that is also democratic.\nWe would, in particular, like to see more meaningful and fruitful contacts between the developed and developing countries to redress the current imbalances in the world economic order.\nThe various initiatives already taken to alleviate the burden of external debt and debt-servicing for developing countries have to date yielded negligible results. We hope that the ongoing dialogue within the Paris Club and other forums will result in more imaginative and action-oriented strategies to salvage the situation.\nThe final review and appraisal of the implementation of the United Nat ions Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, carried out here at United Nations Headquarters in early September, clearly demonstrated that the Programme had very little positive impact on Africa's economic performance. It failed to rally the expected international support for Africa's reform efforts.\nIt is Imperative that both the African countries and the international community demonstrate a serious commitment to the new, successor arrangement. Its success will depend greatly on enhanced donor-community support for Africa.\nToday the issue of the environment is at the centre of the agenda for the future of mankind. We are confident that the forthcoming World Conference on Environment and Development will result in a consensus on strategies for collective international action on the future protection and preservation of the world's environment.\nIn conclusion, allow me to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Under his stewardship during the past 10 years our Organization has been able to lead mankind across the threshold of the new world order. He will forever be remembered in the annals of the history of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to congratulate Mr. Shihabi on his election to the presidency of this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to join preceding speakers, to wish him every success in conducting this session of the United Nations General Assembly. We realise how difficult a task it is but we have confidence in his experience and diplomatic skills and his personal commitment and wise judgement will certainly help him lead this session successfully. I would like to extend my congratulations also to those others who were elected at this Assembly. We are certain that their valuable support will ensure success in the work that we are going to be doing here. Allow mew, therefore, to convey to Mr. 8hihabi, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and on my own behalf, the total confidence we have in his presidency and to pledge the total support and cooperation of our delegation.\nIt is also a great honour for me to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his enlightened leadership of this Organisation in the course of his two terms of office. In fact, it is with a sense of pride and achievement that we have witnessed during this time the settlement of some of the most serious conflicts that seemed to be going to last indefinitely. I am referring specifically to the colonial situation that prevailed in Zimbabwe and in Namibia until recently, to the Iran-Iraq conflict and to the efforts undertaken to solve the Sahraoni question, among others. In fact, the Secretary-General's determination and personal commitment contributed a great deal to their settlement, thus allowing for the restoration of justice, peace and security to those territories\nMay I also extend my warmest congratulations to the newest Members of the Organisation, the Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Micronesia and the two brotherly countries of North Korea and South Korea.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of extreme importance for the history of mankind, as the world situation is evolving towards detente in international relations - this is in spite of the considerable difficulties that remain to be overcome, most of which arise from the obstinate attitude of certain segments of society who are reluctant to accept the positive steps that have been made in order to establish a sound climate of  understanding among people on this planet, conducive to the kind of relations that reflect the lofty aspirations of peace, freedom, justice and social welfare.\nWe believe, however, that common sense will motivate people to re-examine their obsolete positions, if they find themselves unable to adjust to the relentless and irreversible progress made in contemporary history.\nAs a matter of fact, the detente that characterises international relations today was an important factor in the major steps made towards the settlement of the main problems afflicting the world community, thanks to the efforts undertaken in recent years that allowed the cold war to give way to dialogue and the use of force to be replaced by the peaceful settlement of conflicts.\nThe recent signing of the START Treaty between he United States of America and the Soviet Union after talks lasting for nine years is clear evidence that through negotiation people can in fact arrive at an understanding, remove obstacles and eliminate impending threats that may be catastrophic to the future of humankind - all without resorting to force.\nHowever, in order to reach such an understanding it is imperative that foreign interests do not prevail over the interests of a nation and its people. He firmly believe that strict compliance with this principle would enable the warring parties to reflect on their differences and to arrive at a settlement, thus avoiding military confrontation and the inevitable catastrophic consequences, as was the case in the recent Persian Gulf war where thousands of innocent civilians fell victim to massacre.\nFor that reason my Government heartily applauds this gesture of mutual understanding and trust by the two super-Powers, a significant step toward on the road before us, which is still a long one, and urges both of them, as well as all the armament-producing countries, to continue to implement the necessary measures so that in the near future we can arrive at general and complete disarmament on the planet. This is the ultimate aspiration of the whole of mankind, which yearns for unrestricted freedom, peace and tranquillity.\nThe Angolan Government attaches great importance to the positive political developments in southern Africa. In Angola, with the signing of the peace agreements between the Government and UMITA, on 31 May 1991, in Bicesse, Portugal, the peace process in the sub-Saharan region of Africa continued its course.\nFor the Angolan people the coming of peace as a result of the above-mentioned agreement constitutes undoubtedly one of the most remarkable events in contemporary history since 1961 and the beginning of the struggle for national liberation against colonialism followed by our country's accession to independence in 1975 and the ensuing foreign aggression and internal conflict it endured.\nThe revision of our constitutional law, affected even before the signing of the peace agreements, as well as the adoption of new legislation consistent with the revised Constitution, created conditions conducive to the setting up of mechanisms that will facilitate the scheduled multi-party elections and the establishment of the rule of law in Angola. This will open the doors to broader prospects for the full exercise of democracy in the new society to whose creation all national forces, political and other, will contribute.\nThis achievement of the Angolan people will inevitably have a positive impact on the entire subregion, as it will give a new dynamic dimension to the economic activities of all the members of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference. We believe that this success will create an environment of greater openness and trust in our relations with other countries and entities that want to do business with us.\nThe Angolan people and Government are open to all initiatives that might contribute further to what has already been achieved in our country and promote greater development. It is essential, however, that this optimistic and irreversible journey that the Angolan people are ready to undertake, voluntarily and on their own initiative, not be thwarted or disrupted in any way by alien forces, either inside or outside the country.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express once again the appreciation and gratitude of the Angolan people and the Angolan Government to the Portuguese Government for its dedicated commitment and for its mediation efforts to find a solution to the Angolan conflict. These culminated in the signing of the agreement that restored tranquillity to my country.\nI extend my acknowledgments to the Governments of the United States of America and of the Soviet Union, as well as to the United Nations Secretary-General, whose representatives played an invaluable role as observers at the talks.\nFinally, the Angolan and Cuban Governments should be given credit for the major role they played in the peace process. Angola and Cuba adhered strictly to their commitment to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angolan territory. This process was completed by 15 July 1991 - ahead of the schedule that had been agreed upon - as a gesture of good will on the part of the two Governments.\nIn addition to the peace process in Angola, which I have just described as a very important historical event, another event constituted a landmark for the southern region of Africa. I refer to the abolition by the South African Government of the last set of laws that upheld and sustained the apartheid system. However, the acts of violence that constantly occur in South African townships create a climate of instability that is an aberrant contradiction of the climate of hope created with the abolition of the apartheid laws. It is therefore crucial that the South African Government adopt the appropriate measures to put an end to this situation.\nIn spite of the repeal of the apartheid laws, not all questions related to the continued existence of this political regime have been resolved. For example, there is the question of the release of all political prisoners, and the established authorities continue to make mass, arbitrary arrests. This situation is in every way similar to that prevailing under the old regime. It is imperative that there should be created a constituent assembly including all patriotic representative groups in South Africa. This assembly would draft the new constitution. An interim government must be formed to administer the country during the transition period, until free and fair elections are held on a basis of one man, one vote.\nFor all those reasons, my Government considers as premature the total lifting of sanctions against South Africa favoured by some Governments.\nI should like to comment now on the situation in Mozambique. The efforts made by the Government of that country to achieve peace have been constantly frustrated by foreign interference, which hurts the legitimate interests of the Mozambican people. The Angolan people pledge solidarity with the brotherly people of Mozambique, and my Government encourages the Mozambican Government to persevere in its peace efforts by holding direct negotiations with RENAMO, and urges the international community to refrain from any action that might slow down the negotiations or misrepresent their results.\nOn the other hand, one sovereignty issue in southern Africa remains to be resolved. I refer to the Walvis Bay Port Territory, which has been recognised in various General Assembly and Security Council resolutions as an integral part of Namibia.\nThe People's Republic of Angola has been following closely the political developments in different parts of the globe.\nIndonesia's illegal occupation of the Territory of East Timor persists, in violation of internationally accepted rules and principles of international law, and in disregard of the rights and legitimate interests of the Timorese people. The Angolan people and Government pledge their solidarity with the people of East Timor in their just struggle for national independence. We are in favour of talks between Portugal, as the administrating Power overseeing the Territory, and Indonesia, without excluding the physical presence of representatives of East Timor as a direct and concerned party, so that a fair and comprehensive solution may be found - a solution that takes into account, above all, the legitimate interests and rights of the Maubere people.\nIn the Middle East, the prospects for a speedy solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict are discouraging. In our view, the Jewish settlements in occupied Arab territories tend to worsen the conflict rather than contributing in any way to its solution.\nIn the Angolan Government's view, it is crucial that an International conference on the Middle East be urgently convened to bring together all parties involved, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation - an honourable representative of the Palestinian people, which has been fighting for decades for the right to self-determination.\nWe cannot fail to refer, however briefly, to the more effervescent political situations in other regions today.\nAs regards Africa, we reaffirm the right of the peoples in this region to decide their future freely, without foreign interference in the shape of the formation of, or support for, insurgent armed groups, through direct military intervention, or by any other means.\nIn Latin America, interventionist policies, aggression, economic embargoes and interference in the internal affairs and against the interests of another State continue to be a strong threat to the sovereignty of nations in the region, as well as to peace and international security. Such conduct is increasingly in sharp contrast to the growing tendency to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts. \nThe People's Republic of Angola welcomes all initiatives towards the reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula. Proposals for the reunification of Korea must be considered positively, as they can be of great significance for the Korean people and for the peninsula as a whole.\nThe Angolan Government cannot remain indifferent to world economic problems. This is especially so in view of Angola's position in Africa, which is one of the most impoverished regions of the world. In the early 1980s Angola joined other nations in their firm commitment to improve the world economic environment, and, together, help to overcome hunger, poverty, malnutrition and disease epidemics and eliminate illiteracy, and to solve problems inherent in underdevelopment, in order that people might be offered a more dignified life.\nBut as we look at the world economic situation today we realise that, in spite of the efforts undertaken by the international community, it has not been possible so far to solve the problems that affect mainly the developing countries. This was the conclusion drawn at the eighth special session of the General Assembly, held last year, which was devoted to international economic cooperation, and particularly to the re-examination of economic growth and development. \nIn fact, instead of batter balance between the development of the richer countries and that of poorer countries, we are seeing a growing tendency towards polarisation. One example would be that in International trade relations protectionist policies are still being used by the developed countries. The price of raw material exports is constantly declining, and trade conditions continue to deteriorate, undermining efforts by the developing countries to restructure their economies.\nAnother factor that constitutes a major obstacle to the economic and social development of developing countries is their foreign debt. We believe that developing countries, which are the debtors, and the developed countries, which are the creditors, should make use of the available mechanisms and take measures to put an end to the wasting of resources that we see in the developing countries. This point was recently acknowledged at a ministerial-level meeting of non-aligned countries in Accra.\nMe are, nevertheless, convinced that, if the strategy for international development for the Fourth United Nations Decade for Development, adopted at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, is implemented, many problems will be more easily solved.\nAs we have already mentioned, Africa is the most impoverished continent on cur planet, in spite of the vast natural resources with which it is endowed. In fact the constant deterioration of the economic situation in most African countries, caused by losses in export revenues, either because of the staggering costs of imports or because of their serious foreign debt, which has reached more than $270 billion, is a reason for our Governments to feel concerned, because it constitutes a new factor conducive to political and social instability.\nA few days ago the United Nations evaluated its Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which was adopted approximately five years ago. As we can see, the results are not very encouraging. The international community should give more support towards the effective implementation of this Programme, because otherwise the African countries will not be able to deal with the crisis that is eroding the continent. The situation is further worsened by the significant changes that have taken place in political and economic relations, with particular relevance to the developments in Eastern Europe.\nAs regards the economic situation in southern Africa, we are hopeful that the ending of the war in Angola and Mozambique and the complete abolition of apartheid in South Africa will open new and broad prospects for economic development for the benefit of countries in the subregion, through the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC). Taking this objective into account, its member countries are relying increasingly on the support of the international community; this support can be an invaluable contribution to the solution of social problems afflicting the people in the subregion.\nIn December 1989 the United Nations adopted resolution 44/168, on international assistance for the economic recovery of Angola. For the reasons stated at the time, it has not yet been possible to implement it effectively. We believe, however, that, given the present conditions in our country, it is now possible to implement it more expeditiously. We believe that the donor countries, which have been somewhat apprehensive in the past, can now be reassured. \n\nWe should like once again to thank the Member States that in one way or another have helped us, and we appeal to them to maintain a firm commitment to the continuance o\u00a3 assistance to the People's Republic of Angola.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all. Sir, to extend to you the warmest congratulations of the Italian Government on your election as President of the Assembly, which reflects the international prestige enjoyed by your country, with which Italy has close and long-standing ties of friendship. Your personal qualities and experience augur well for the progress of work at this session of the General Assembly, which will have to deal with matters of pressing concern to the international community.\nI would also like to offer our most sincere good wishes to the seven new Member States, whose admission promotes the principle of universality of the United Nations, to which Italy completely subscribes. We therefore warmly welcome the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.\nPermit me also to express my deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, for the continuous efforts he has made during the past year, as in the preceding nine years, to promote international peace and justice and the principles of the United Nations.\nDuring the year that has elapsed since the last General Assembly session, the changes set in motion by the welcome development of the reunification of Germany have been further consolidated and amplified. The collapse of communism has been reshaping Europe. A massive political and institutional restructuring is now in progress, and it will have profound repercussions in the economic field as well.\nThe threat of nuclear holocaust that overshadowed our planet has now abated. Armaments are no longer the main point of reference in relations among States. The ideological struggle - the competition for world supremacy - which fostered the arms race has ceased to exist. This bears out the truth of the ancient maxim, not always heeded, that weapons in themselves are not the cause of wars and tensions; rather they are a reflection of our ambitions and our fears.\nRecent events in the Soviet Union mark an irreversible step forward on the road to democracy and new-found unity in Europe. They open up a new era in global cooperation and creative friendship among peoples.\nThe Gulf war defeated the strategy of Saddam Hussein, based on the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction and on aggression. The success of the coalition and the action undertaken by the United Nations justified the difficult choice we all made. Failure to confront the Iraqi dictator would have merely encouraged him to embark on new adventures. The United Nations conferred the seal of legitimacy on the international coalition and provided the instruments of an embargo and an ultimatum. To the Organisation we entrust the implementation of measures to eliminate completely a military Power capable of inflicting further destruction and committing new acts of aggression. We also hope to derive from this experience the incentive for a more generalized control over the transfer and proliferation of sophisticated weaponry and weapons of mass destruction.\nIn the case of regional crises such as Cambodia, a solution is in sight, while the situations in Cyprus and Afghanistan remain difficult. And the moment of truth has arrived for the parties involved in the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli conflict, revolving around the question of Palestine, continues to be a central issue, both politically and strategically. Forty years of refusals and denials on both sides have erected a barrier that cannot be torn down overnight.\nThere is still a long way to go, but clearly the next step is the conference on \\\"territory-for-peace\\\", a phrase which represents the only possible outcome if due account is to be taken, inter alia, of the need to affirm, in this case as in others - and giving equal weight to other principles at issue - the right to self-determination, to which we Europeans are particularly sensitive. It would be a pity if the two sides persisted in maintaining dogmatic positions now rendered obsolete by reality. The wrongs suffered by the Palestinians must not be a pretext for violence, while the violence endured by the Jews throughout so much of their history should be a prelude only to peace. Israel's task will be to take the first step towards normalizing relations with surrounding countries. A constructive attitude on the matter of settlements in the occupied territories would be an important step too. In turn, the Arabs will have to terminate the campaign aimed at Israel's liquidation. The territories are not an Israeli conquest but the outcome of aggression perpetrated against Israel. They are its ultimate defense. They can, however, be replaced by other guarantees. The war waged by the Arabs against the Jews must end in a draw, an6 agreements must be stipulated which the peoples can accept and respect in the interest of peace and security.\nIt is to be hoped that no one will want to take responsibility for undermining the efforts of President Bush and my colleague.\nSecretary of State Baker. Those efforts must be supported until they achieve the success that has eluded previous attempts.\nThe new order still has to be built. We are keenly aware that we cannot shirk our responsibility in this regard, and also realize that we have reached a point where, for the first time in the history of mankind, the problems of our planet can be tackled only on a global scale.\nThe new order is inevitable, because the old one is gone. This new order will have to be based on rules, principles and institutions accepted by all, and capable of ensuring the protection of fundamental human rights, the development of democracy, the peaceful settlement of disputes, united opposition to aggression, the reduction of armaments, and freedom and justice for all peoples. In other words, the new order must reflect the logic of integration as against the logic of disintegration, dissension and intolerance.\nThe choice of disintegration may be justified in the light of reactions inspired by fear and insecurity in the wake of the collapse of the old order, while the new one that will succeed it is still uncertain. Ha see the two philosophies of integration and disintegration confronting each other in the very center of Europe, where structures are foiling apart, and trying to reorganize on the basis of new rules and principles. In Eastern Europe millions of people are paying dearly for the disastrous consequences of false myths and ideologies. It would be an illusion to think that mere reversion to democracy and a market economy can lead to rapid recovery in those countries, as long as their society is in a state of dissolution. We West Europeans must first make available the wealth of experience and material resources we have accumulated over the years.\nIt would be inappropriate for us, as countries committed to liberal and social democracy, to erect a new wall to keep out others. We must be prepared for substantial financial sacrifices, whose dimensions Italy has repeatedly tried to quantify.\nThe main danger facing the new world order is, in fact, the creation of an impassable gulf between rich and poor countries, between the northern and the southern hemispheres. A truly new order must come to grips with the poverty and underdevelopment that lie at the root of the disarray we see in the world today. Otherwise, the flow of poverty-stricken masses towards the industrialized world, from both the East and the South, will become unstoppable. This flow, spurred by uncertain economic prospects or uncontrolled demographic growth, would upset social balances that are fragile and promote hostility among the poor and egotism among the rich.\nThe Europe that has emerged from the cold war has sufficient resources to help build a credible order capable of providing an acceptable life, in their country of origin, for the multitudes who are massing on its borders.\nIf we hesitate we could witness the emergence of an international coexistence that is even harsher and more pitiless than that experienced during the cold war years. He could also fail to attain our objective of an integrated system to replace the tragic divisions of the past. The trends towards fragmentation which we see around us are numerous and dangerous. Indeed, we are only too familiar with them.\nFirst there is the problem of nationalism, which could plunge the restructuring of Europe - from the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia - into chaos. Europe is particularly vulnerable, as it is haunted by historical memories, verging at times on the obsessive. These memories make the very principle of self-determination hard to administer and harmonize with other equally important principles. Everything was simpler in the days of the balance of nuclear power, and everything becomes more complex in the transition from detente to integration. When the central authority of a totalitarian party collapses, local nationalism and ethnic conflicts resurface, and they threaten to make society ungovernable.\nIn Europe nationalism has caused bloodshed and destruction in the past, partly because there was no political or moral authority capable of arbitrating conflicts. Today the situation is different. He have the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Community and the Council of Europe, which are capable of reconciling solidarity with independence and integration with respect for national identities, and which, as in the case of the Twelve, serve as a model for new federations.\nWe must support those who are trying to form associations or confederations of free nations. Within individual countries, respect for the rights of minorities will assume a central role in synthesizing the demands of self-determination and the needs of integration. Within our own borders, and specifically in Alto Adige, Italy has constructed a model of autonomy which will be completed in the next few weeks, hopefully even before the end of this session.\nThe Gulf war has revealed another possible source of fragmentation and discord between the West and the Arab world. We are not yet free of the danger of new holy wars and new types of intolerance on the part of fundamentalists using religion as a political means. Here, too, we must make a distinction between a justifiable need for an identity, which serves a unifying function, and the belief that one is a besieged minority holding the only key to enlightenment. This feeling produces a siege mentality, fear of the outside world and the idea that evil is embodied in a single clearly identifiable enemy - either the State of Israel or the West as a whole.\nRacism as a statutory norm will disappear with the demise of apartheid. But it poses a continuing threat to society, including our Western societies that are receiving a host of new immigrants flocking to our cities in search of refuge, protection and hope.\nThe pronouncement once made by the United Nations equating Zionism with racism is particularly unacceptable at this juncture. It was made at a time when our Organization was dominated by automatic, Manichean majorities, hostile in principle to the State of Israel. Any resolution that equates the quest for a homeland, an aspiration common to many European cultures undergoing a Risorgimento of their own, with an act of genocide is, to our way of thinking, an aberration. We must ensure that this outrage is expunged from the annals of our Organization. We, for our part, are committed to seeing that this happens during the present session.\nProtectionism is the other grave danger threatening our future. If the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were to fail, regionalism would prevail over multilateralism, reducing trade to bilateral relations that could marginalize the poorer countries completely. If the current round of negotiations is not completed by the end of this year, the door will be open to all kinds of protectionist and autarchic schemes, somewhat tempered by fragile bilateral agreements that are subject to revision whenever there is a change in the economic situation. In a climate of protectionism it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to undertake any major effort to integrate the third-world countries into the world economy or to give the newly emerging Eastern democracies easier access to free markets. The sacrifices demanded of these countries would appear even more unfair when compared with the selfish rivalries between the rich of this world.\nThe involvement of the Security Council and the Secretary-General in the management of the Yugoslav crisis is in itself a sign of the new times we are living in and of the need for a dynamic interpretation of the role of the United Nations in situations which depart from the classical pattern of inter-State conflicts.\nThe way in which the leading world Organization handles the crisis will test the United Nations capacity to play a peacemaking role even in such complex cases as that of Yugoslavia.\nThe same obviously applies to the European Community, which Immediately realized the risks arising from the Yugoslav crisis, and from the very outset has been seeking a peaceful solution in the framework of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and developed in the Charter of Paris, namely, the right to self-determination, the preservation of territorial integrity, and the protection of the rights of minorities.\nThe adoption of resolution 713 (1991) by the Security Council reflects the broad international consensus on the need to try all possible means of containing the Yugoslav crisis and encouraging the search for political means of settling it. It also completes, in an exemplary manner, a process that is clearly indicative of the growing complementarity of the various organizational levels at which international decision-making is conducted.\nFirst proposed by the Twelve, subsequently endorsed by 35 States participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and further developed with the involvement of the Western European Union, the initiative to promote peace in Yugoslavia is now enriched by the very important contribution of the Security Council, and there is no doubt that with this development the international community's desire to see the Yugoslav crisis channeled into paths of peace will have been fully satisfied.\nThe successful achievement of integration will be contingent on the acceptance of rules and principles and the existence of institutions capable, not only of establishing them, but also of enforcing them. This is the constructive innovation that has been made possible precisely by the changes in Europe and other parts of the world. The prospect of universality supporting the United Nations is based on the affirmation of a new scale of common values, the first prerequisite of a democratic world order. We are witnessing the application, also in inter-State relations, of that freedom defined by Kant as the option not to obey any laws other than those to which one has freely consented. We are gradually moving from guarantees within the State to guarantees against the State, overcoming the discrepancy, too frequently encountered in the past, between promises and fulfillment.\nThis objective is being attained at the regional level, and Indeed is being effectively achieved in the European context, but it is increasingly becoming the stain task of the United Nations. As we have seen in the aftermath of the Gulf war, the right to intervene for humanitarian ends and for the protection of human rights is gaining ground. This type of intervention has become an idea-force, and the most truly innovative concept of the remaining decade of this century. This must be the focal point of our efforts through the United Nations, which is also the main forum of the new world order. Intervention that is primarily aimed at securing protection of human rights and respect for the basic principles of peaceful coexistence, is a prerogative of the international community, which must have the power to suspend sovereignty whenever it is exercised in a criminal manner. The international community must be on the side both of democratically elected parliaments and of oppressed nationalities, whether those emerging within the new Europe, or the Kurds.\nIt would be both understandable and useful if this process first occurred in a smaller geographical area, among more homogeneous countries, such as those belonging to the European Community and those participating in the CSCE. There is no conflict here. In fact, this regional approach and the global approach represented by the United Nations are complementary.\nThe European Community la asking its own original contribution to this process and is bent on consolidating and improving the effectiveness of its own organization. If one half of Europe, committed to adopting a democratic political structure and a market economy is redesigned, the other half cannot maintain the same old balances and preserve the institutions of the past.\nThe time has come also to adjust the structures and tasks of the United Nations. Of course, this is not the first time the question has been raised, but now discussion of it has become inevitable in the light of the following considerations:\nFirst, the end of East-West rivalry, which paralyzed the Organization's activities, and the risk, instead, of a more explosive North-South confrontation;\nSecond, the achievement of universality by the United Nations, enhanced by the most recent admissions of new Members;\nThird, the restructuring of the international community. Such new forms of supranationality as the European Community are emerging; a country such as the Soviet Union, which will also become one of the supporting structures of the new order, is being radically transformed;\nFourth, the need to involve in our collective responsibility countries that have hitherto played a role not commensurate with their importance, and that are now acquiring a new political and economic dimension and a new awareness of their tasks;\nFifth, the need to ensure that no single country or small group of countries can assume responsibility for constituting a sort of military arm of the new international order;\nSixth, the dissemination of rules and principles that are finally gaining universal acceptance and could be enforced at a level above national sovereignties;\nSeventh, the transition to the globality of a world system governable only by a renovated United Rations, complemented by other groups of limited geographical dimensions, which will help to apply the same principles and rules.\nThese ideas could provide the basis for a possible reorganization of the United Nations, which should be gradual in nature but entail changes in certain important provisions currently in force. As structured at present, the United Nations affords a guarantee of, but sometimes imposes limits on, the governability of the world. An initial partial contribution is already contained in some proposals presented informally by a group of countries, which we appreciate. But we clearly need to go further. Italy, in pursuance of some earlier suggestions, considers that the following major goals should be sought.\nOne should be the elimination of all discriminatory language from the Charter, especially that deriving from the Second World War, which seems even less acceptable now that the cold war is over. I have in mind the references\nto the so-called \\\"enemy States\\\", which means those that were defeated at that time. We intend to launch a specific initiative in that connection, in consultation with the countries concerned, at the earliest opportunity;\nA second goal should be the expansion of the Security Council, with the increase in the number of both permanent and non-permanent members, which would not necessarily entail extending the right of veto to all the new permanent members. We propose that the selection of the latter should be made on the basis of objective criteria, such as the size of the country's population and its gross national product. The Security Council was first expanded in 1963 to take into account the increase in the number of Member States. Since then, the membership has risen from 113 to 166 - a 50 per cent increase. This factor is in itself sufficient to warrant - and indeed to make necessary - an expansion of this decision-making body of the Organization. Since it is required to make choices of major importance, the Security Council must fully reflect developments in international society;\nA third goal should be the revision of some Chapters of the Charter, such as Chapter VII. Here, too, on the basis of recent experience ranging from the Persian Gulf to Yugoslavia, and with the emergence of the principle of active intervention for humanitarian purposes that I referred to earlier, there is ample scope for innovation;\nA fourth goal should be the introduction of a system of weighted voting, in both the General Assembly and the Security Council. This is not a problem to be dealt with now, but a distant prospect that cannot be overlooked if we are to take more timely and effective decisions. Various proposals have also been made on this point in the past, and they could be usefully studied.\nOn questions regarding the removal of references to \\\"enemy States\\\", the expansion of the Security Council and the revision of the Charter, Italy will be submitting some written comments in the course of this session, as a contribution to our joint deliberations.\nWe realize how difficult it is simply to contemplate the changes I have just outlined. I know it means retreating from established positions, giving up some prerogatives, and undertaking a redistribution of international power to reflect the changes that have taken place in the world in recent years, particularly since 1989.\nBut we believe that the task must have seemed just as daunting to those who, nearly half a century ago, defined the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and participation, not entirely free of illusions, at the end of the two conflicts that have divided the world during this century.\nToday, international realities and the expectation they generate give us a similar mandate, at the conclusion of a third world war, which was incomparably less bloody than those that had preceded it but which has left us a legacy of risks and dangers no less serious. We would be remiss in our duty if we continued to apply the same rules and used the same tools as before. If there \u00bb to be a renewal, the United Nations must be overhauled. We should like this to be one of the messages sent by the General Assembly at its present session.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by saying that I am honoured indeed to be in New York on this occasion and, for the first time, to speak on behalf of my country at the United Nations General Assembly, at this its forty-sixth session.\nThe oft-repeated hopes of delegations, expressed from this rostrum, for an end to ideological confrontation and the bipolar division of the world appear to have become tangible realities at this crucial time at the end of the twentieth century. Indeed, the signing, last August, of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and recent statements in which the American and Soviet Heads of State proposed further reductions from the threshold indicated by the Moscow Treaty demonstrate the new spirit of cooperation that characterizes relations between the two super-Powers. For the first time in 30 years we see the spectre of nuclear war receding.\nThe beginning of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly in that context of hope and expectation gives us reason to adopt a spirit of conviviality and to engage in sincere debate with no ulterior motives.\nIn other words the session over which you. Sir, are presiding should be an opportunity for us to look at our environment and our world in a new light, with new ideals of solidarity and a sense of being part of the same space. I am convinced that, with you, Mr. President, at the helm, we shall tackle without difficulty the different challenges of our world today - disease, ignorance and poverty. My delegation is very happy that you, the representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - guardian of the Holy Shrines of Islam, and, like Chad, a member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference - should be presiding at this session. You and the other officers have the full assurance of my delegation's complete cooperation. We wish you every success in your endeavours.\nI should like to express to Mr. Guido de Marco the satisfaction of my delegation at the elegant manner in which he presided over the work of the forty-fifth session of the Assembly.\nI should like also to express once again to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who is reaching the end of his second term as Secretary-General of the 0rgani2ation, the full gratitude of Chad for all his tireless efforts in the causes of peace and development. Me is leaving us at a time when multilateralism has been rejuvenated, thanks in particular to his dynamic efforts. We shall greatly miss his familiar face and his dynamism. On behalf of the Government of Chad I wish him a good and pleasant retirement and assure him of our readiness to extend our full support to his successor at a time when the United Nations will be called upon to play an increasingly important role.\nMy delegation is pleased to note that this great family of the United Nations is continuing to expand. It is with pleasure that we welcome into our midst the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nThe year 1990 was one of profound change. It was the year that saw the re-emergence of the active role of the United Nations as an instrument in the service of peace. Indeed, for the first time in many years our Organization is playing the role envisaged for it in the Charter - the maintenance of peace through the implementation of relevant provisions.\nEverywhere in the world, changes towards real democracy have begun. From now on, all the peoples of the world will have the possibility of enjoying the right to self-determination and of taking charge of their own destiny. In Africa the process is continuing, with the holding of national conferences and with the organization of truly free elections, in which people may choose from among many programmes and many candidates. In Chad the year 1990 was a year of freedom, for it saw the overthrow of one of the bloodiest dictatorships in Africa, one which in the span of sight years murdered more than 10,000 Chadians. Had it not been for the victory of the Patriotic Movement of Salvation, the outside world would never have known of the horrors which that merciless dictatorship perpetrated in my country for reasons of State. The parody of a referendum organised In December 1989 with regard to the Constitution was designed to distract the attention of outside observers from the massacres that bloodthirsty regime was carrying out. The \\\"democratic\\\" provisions of that famous Constitution were never implemented. In fact the Constitution only served as a smokescreen for the dictatorship. In the circumstances, all the new authorities could do was suspend it. They did so, replacing it with the new national charter adopted on 28 February 1991, which now governs the political life of the nation. This chattel clearly states in article 2:\n\\\"The people are sovereign, and no faction or individual may assume the right to exercise sovereignty.\\\" That provision is a striking manifestation of the firm desire of the Patriotic Movement of Salvation and the Government to eliminate once and for all the spectre of flagrant violations of human rights and to establish a pluralistic democracy in the country. Today we are proud to say that Chad is a country of freedom. Freedom of opinion and respect for human rights are central to the policy of the new authorities. Thus, private daily and weekly newspapers influence public opinion in the country and attack - sometimes violently - the actions of the Government, thereby playing the proper role of a free press in a democracy. Furthermore, with the adoption of the charter of the parties on 1 October 1991, the people of Chad now have the freedom to be active in the party of their choice: no more obligatory membership in a single party, no more political prisons and police.\nChad, which has suffered for so long from war, now wishes finally to enjoy genuine internal and external peace. President Idriss Deby has always said that the time has come to deal with one another by means other than weapons. It is clear that the choice of the people of Chad is a confrontation of ideas. Thus a national conference will be held in May 1992, and, in addition to drawing up the future constitution, it will establish the framework for democracy. In a country which for more than 30 years lived under a series of bloody dictatorships, we shall have a difficult apprenticeship, but this is our irreversible choice. For we must do everything to avoid going back to the past and must move forward to the building of a State of law in which all citizens will participate at various levels in the open management of public affairs, in order to attain our objectives. Several obstacles to the attainment of those objectives have already appeared. The most difficult are the reorganization of an administration deeply shaken by two decades of war and the reduction of the size of a greatly over-staffed army. This requires considerable material and financial resources, but we are convinced that with the assistance of our partners we shall achieve those objectives.\nChad, a victim of drought and desertification, has been confronted with endemic diseases and other natural disasters such as floods which have left many homeless. In addition, our production structures were disorganized at the time of the rout of the dictator. We shall therefore have to fight on several fronts.\nAs regards the economy, the disorganization of our customs administration because of the events of December 1990 has resulted in a tremendous decline in State income, jeopardizing the objectives of the current adjustment process. We are also suffering from the effects of the world economic situation, particularly since our country is dependent on a single export crop. These difficulties, further aggravated by the burden of the heavy debt of 3.5 billion CPA francs left by the former dictatorship in Chad's account at the Bank of Central African States, have eliminated all the resources at the Government's disposal to re-launch our economy. Despite all these obstacles, the Government remains determined to foster a liberal economy and to permit the development of small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. In this connection, the Government intends to organize early in 1992 a round-table conference of providers of funds in the private sector. The seminar held on this subject in May 1991 enabled us to establish an overall strategy. This round-table conference will be designed not to examine the strategy in depth, so as to make it functional, but also to seek support from possible future partners.\nAt the same time, Chad would like to devote the same sustained attention to rural development, thus pursuing the established objective of attaining food self-sufficiency in the future. Furthermore, preliminary prospecting financed by the United Nations Revolving Fund for natural resources exploration has revealed the existence of several minerals. The Government of Chad will continue the search for partners to help us in exploiting the mineral resources which may thus be identified.\nThe achievement of all these objectives is conditional on the development of our national technical capabilities, which can be done only by means of training. In this connection, the Government of Chad is currently seeking ways and means of implementing the recommendations of the round-table conference on the questions of education, training and employment, held in November 1990 in Ndjamena. The transformation of our educational structures and programmes to carry out proper training for employment requires considerable investment, for equipment and the building or remodelling of training centres. In addition to those medium-term and long-term social problems, there are others that are even more urgent, such as the question of the reintegration of refugees, exiles and displaced persons who, since December 1990, have been streaming back to Chad and the regions where they had lived; the problem of the spread of the cholera epidemic; and the devastation of fields and dwellings by the floods caused by the heavy rains in July and August 1991. All those negative factors require us to seek assistance once again from our partners, and in December 1991 we intend to submit to them in Paris an emergency plan covering in particular the needs in regard to the reorganization of the army and the resettlement of the refugees.\nDespite all these difficulties, the people of Chad do not despair, for they know that the international solidarity which manifested itself in combating the effects of the drought and the cholera epidemic will once again be forthcoming for us in our implacable struggle for survival. We take this opportunity to thank friendly countries and the agencies of the United Nations system for all the help they have been giving Chad for many years now. Our most sincere thanks go particularly to the friendly Governments that have generously supported us at a critical time in our history. Once again we make a resounding appeal to them from this rostrum to continue to help us in implementing our emergency programme of reconstruction and development, which I have mentioned earlier. We shall continue our practice of previous years and we shall introduce this year two draft resolutions under agenda items 84 (b) and 97 (b). We sincerely and wholeheartedly hope that we shall obtain the support, of all Member States for their adoption.\nIf we have enjoyed the support of all these partners, it is because they have demonstrated solidarity with us in our sorrow. At this time, when confrontation has given way to cooperation, Chad is implementing the policy of good neighbourliness in its external policy. Since December 1990, Chad has acted in concert with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries, particularly with all our neighbours. For the first time since 1982, Chad's relations with its neighbours are not a source of conflict. Indeed, the good neighbourliness policy practised by the new authorities in Chad are based on a spirit of dialogue and agreement for we believe that a policy of continuing confrontation and friction between neighbours is not in our best interests. Not only are our meagre resources drained for military expenses, but most of all implementation of the development programmes which the populations need is thereby delayed.\nIt is in this political climate that we have come to a decisive stage in the border dispute between my country and the Libyan Arab Jamahariya. The two parties have seized this opportunity to accept a verdict of the International Court of Justice. Since December 1990, relations between our two countries and our peoples have normalized. This is a challenge for cooperation to replace hatred and for understanding to prevail and we welcome this development.\nIn recent sessions we reviewed the various regional conflicts and without really believing that much would happen, we nevertheless expressed the hope that solutions would be found. This time we see that, due to the new spirit of solidarity and understanding which has developed between the super-Powers, these conflicts are beginning to be resolved one after another. On behalf of the Government and people of Chad, allow me once again to pay a tribute to Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev for the new spirit in international relations and the new relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nAs the Secretary-General stated in his report!\n\\\"Peace has won victories on several fronts. Many a people have been released from the agonies of strife. The process is capable of extension to other areas.\\\" {A/46/1, page 22) This analysis properly describes the situation of the world of today. On the one hand, remarkable results have been achieved and, on the other, a great deal still remains to be done before peace can be attained.\nIn South Africa, the legal pillars of apartheid have been abolished. This is a first step towards the attainment of a multiracial Africa with all citizens enjoying the same rights, but much remains to be done to achieve these results and the path is strewn with many dangers. There is need to expedite negotiations for the adoption of a new constitution and an effective transfer of power to the black majority, particularly by putting an end to the entrenchment of the forces of destabilization which are the source of violence in the townships.\nAfter 16 years of bloodshed in Western Sahara we hope that peace will be established by means of the referendum to be held in January 1992 under United Nations auspices. While we congratulate the Secretary-General for his perseverance we wish, at the same time, to appeal to the parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations and, finally, accept the result of the vote.\nIn Asia, my delegation welcomes the progress achieved in the negotiations between the various Cambodian factions. Those negotiations have made it possible for the Cambodian delegation to resume its place in this Assembly. The admission to United Nations membership of the two Koreas will, we hope, make it possible one day to achieve reunification of the two countries. Indeed, the reunification of Germany and of Yemen gives us reason to hope that this possibility will be realised if that is the legitimate aspiration of the people concerned.\nRegarding Afghanistan, the determination of the United States and the Soviet Union to bring peace to that country will, we are convinced, lead to constructive dialogue between the resistance movements and the Government.\nIn the Persian Gulf, the consequences of the invasion and liberation of Kuwait should have resulted in the return of peace. Unfortunately, that is not the case and the risk of new confrontations prevails in the region. The delegation of Chad supports the efforts designed to enforce the Security Council resolutions on this subject. However, we would like to advocate that all the Council's resolutions should be equally applied. We refer in particular to the situation prevailing in the Middle East where General Assembly and Security Council resolutions have remained without effect for more than 10 years. Clearly, Chad lends its full support to the steps undertaken by the United States to convene an international peace conference on the basis of the Baker plan and relevant resolutions of the Security Council. However, we insist that all interested parties be invited to participate in this gathering on an equal footing. This condition is indispensable for, without equal treatment, it is unlikely that serious negotiations can really begin.\nWhile until now Europe has been spared civil war, the transformations of the people's democracies have given rise to serious challenges to certain political structures. The Baltic States incorporated in the Soviet Union following the de facto Soviet-German Pact of August 1939 have become independent. Germany is now united, while the Soviet Union is being transformed following the events in Moscow of August 1991. These transformations have caused serious difficulties in some cases. For example, in Yugoslavia they have led to bloody confrontations which Europe has not seen since the Second World War. My delegation views with alarm this decline in the situation of a non-aligned State and calls upon Yugoslavia to find its path quickly to a settlement of these differences without useless bloodshed.\nThis glance at the situation prevailing in the world demonstrates how right the Secretary-General is in his appraisal of the situation. In some places, peace is making progress. In others, confrontation continues. This dichotomy between war and peace in certain contiguous areas reminds us that we must make further efforts to ensure peace in the world in general.\nIn this connection, my delegation would like, once again, to issue a call for peace since only frank and direct dialogue between brothers and parties to a conflict will make the achievement of true peace possible.\nThe world has witnessed the end of the East-West confrontation with great relief and is nurturing the hope for new prospects in international economic relations. My delegation sincerely believes that the new world order must support the peoples who are struggling to achieve social and economic development. They must be helped to rid themselves of poverty and ignorance by being provided with the means to accomplish it.\nIndeed, the 1991 report of the United Nations Development Programme on human development notes, with regard to countries in the South, that more than half a billion human beings are living in dire poverty, some 180 million children - that is one out of three - are suffering from serious malnutrition, that 1.5 billion persons have no access to primary health services, that nearly 3 million children die each year from diseases for which vaccines exist, that approximately a billion adults are illiterate, and that the number of children of school age who do not attend school is in excess of 100 million.\nThose frightful statistics bear witness, if any were needed, to the failure of the last three United Nations Development Decades. At the end of this millennium the burning question is not one of available resources but whether those resources are being properly distributed - which presumes solidarity based on real political will.\nAfrica, for its part, continues to sink into the implacable crisis that began over a decade ago, notwithstanding the historic contract into which it entered with the rest of the international community in 1986. How could it have been otherwise, when the countries of the African continent do not control the prices of their raw materials and face constantly rising prices for capital goods and when the burden of debt servicing has become intolerable?\nConcrete actions must be undertaken urgently to reverse this trend. We must, inter alia, guarantee a fair price for raw materials, lift protectionist measures, lower trade tariffs and cancel the debt. Such actions would enable Africa to realize real economic growth, an indispensable condition for the success of the ongoing democratisation programme.\nIn the next three years the international community is preparing to consider some of the serious problems that concern all mankind and that\ncondition its very survival. In particular, there will be the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992; the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 and the Conference on Population and Development in 1994, whose theme will be \\\"Population, Economic Growth and Sustainable Development\\\". These different gatherings are all focused on the human condition in a world that has become more interdependent and that enjoys greater solidarity.\nWith regard to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Chad attaches great importance to it. As a country of the Sahel, Chad is experiencing a desertification that is affecting the socio-economic activities of its population. We therefore hope that that Conference will be able to come up with a strategy that will enable us both to preserve the environment and to ensure development.\nHaving rid itself of the fear of a possible nuclear holocaust brought on by ideological confrontations, mankind today has every chance to realize its profound aspiration to the peace it has sought for so long. The time is ripe, and we must seize this opportunity to transform international relations to respond to the requirements of history. We must build confidence and set a single objective: the well-being of mankind. To do this, my delegation believes that true coexistence among peoples without any distinction as to race, language and religion - and among States as well - must be established, coexistence in which the United Nations will finally be able to play the crucial role of guarantor of peace.\nIn this connection I should like to conclude by calling for a widening of the Secretary-General's field of competence. He should not have to wait to be seized of a conflict but should be able to take up a question immediately when threats to international peace and security begin to loom up on the horizon and act as a mediator or peace-maker. Mankind has suffered from too many conflicts in recent years. We must act urgently to put an end to bloody confrontations among States and within States. That too requires the solidarity whose end result is universal peace and an end to human suffering from deprivation.\nPeace and solidarity are the key words that, I hope, will guide the future actions of the peoples of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to convey to the President, on behalf of the Government and people of Latvia and on my own behalf, our sincere congratulations on his election to preside over this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His assumption of this post carries special significance for Latvia, for he is presiding over what is for our country our inaugural session as Members of the United Nations. I would also like to take this opportunity to convey the best wishes and appreciation of my country to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.\nAlthough Latvia was a founding member of the League of Nations, because of the subsequent foreign occupation of our country, we were unable to participate in the establishment of the United Nations. We have had to wait 47 years for this moment, yet the delay has not diminished the joy that accompanies our rightful and lawful return to the international community. On the contrary, we take special satisfaction in joining an international Organization that has grown in stature and importance through the years, thanks to the leadership and statesmanship of the Secretary-General.\nLatvia takes its place in the United Nations at a turning-point in world history. Since the 1920s the people of Latvia have always believed that the existence of any internationally recognized State is an objective reality, one that cannot be eradicated by force. The rapid manner in which global diplomatic ties were renewed with the Baltic States during August and September of this year is, perhaps, one of the most dramatic examples of civilization's progress towards achieving true democracy and international equality in our lifetime. The people of Latvia express their heartfelt gratitude to the Members of the United Nations and to all the nations that have supported us for their profound understanding and support.\nIn this regard, I should once again like to welcome and congratulate our fellow new Members of the United Nations: the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and our neighbours to the north and south, the Republic of Estonia and the Republic of Lithuania. We are proud to commence our United Nations activities in such distinguished company.\nThe enthusiasm with which Latvia assumes its role in the United Nations is driven by more than national self-interest. It is our sincere hope that recent developments have given birth to a new era of democracy and cooperation in the world. The events of August in the formerly communist Soviet Union have given rise to hopes that from this point onwards. East West, relations will no longer be a source of confrontation but Instead a vehicle for solving complex global and regional problems.\nWe are convinced that Latvia will play an instrumental role in this problem-solving process. It is our belief that now, as has been the case throughout history, Latvia is destined to serve as a natural bridge between Eastern and Western Europe. Where we once served as a battlefield for opposing foreign armies, we can now serve as a crossroads for commercial exchange and economic cooperation. Fully cognizant of this great responsibility, we are ready and eager to make our contribution to the inexorable democratic evolution of the new world order.\nTo succeed in this undertaking, Latvia must immediately begin the process of addressing a number of critical issues. Primary among them is the reconstruction and rebirth of Latvia's economy. We must train and prepare specialists and professionals whose task it will be both to meet Latvia's immediate needs and simultaneously build an economic structure that will shape Latvia's future role in Europe and the world.\nTo achieve this goal, the process of restoring Latvia's fully independent statehood must be brought to a conclusion without delay. This includes the removal, as soon as possible, of the foreign troops that continue, illegally, to occupy Latvian soil. A just settlement of this issue in the Baltic region is of crucial importance if we hope to further the process of guaranteeing the long-term security and cooperation of all nations, riot only in our region but throughout the world.\nWe are extremely encouraged by the bold initiative undertaken by the United States of America and endorsed by the Soviet. Union, calling for substantial reductions of these nations' nuclear weapons. We see this action as the first concrete step towards the realization of our own long-held dream of a nuclear-free Baltic region.\nThe people of Latvia are ready to work hand in hand with all the peoples of the world. We are opening our doors, our minds and our hearts to all that which has been achieved globally in the areas of economic, humanitarian, environmental and cultural endeavour. We are fully committed to the spirit of open and honest exchange so that we can both learn from that which has already been accomplished and contribute to that which still needs to be done.\nWe are firmly convinced that through cooperation and coordination with our Baltic neighbours, we can create a geopolitical region that will demonstrate to the world that the transition from the shackles of totalitarian communism to the open democratic structures can be achieved in a peaceful, disciplined and orderly manner.\nJust as the United Nations demonstrates the benefits of multilateral, inter-ethnic cooperation, we in Latvia are equally committed to guaranteeing equal rights to all national minorities and individuals in our territory, irrespective of their ethnic origins or ideological convictions. We have taken concrete steps to address the needs and concerns of all those who live within our borders and will continue to develop policies in this direction. Human rights, democracy and adherence to the norms of international law were the guiding principles of our struggle to restore independence and will continue to serve as a foundation for our internal development and reintegration into the world community. It is our hope that from our example, others facing similar obstacles can take both strength and inspiration.\nAs a Member of the United Nations, Latvia will look to other Member nations, organizations and the Secretariat for guidance and assistance in developing the future character and international role of our country. That Latvia's period of reconstruction coincides with a major restructuring of the world order can be viewed as beneficial to all concerned, for it will foster Increased cooperation and coordination in all aspects of this developmental process.\nFor example, we welcome proposals to improve the emergency humanitarian-aid framework within the United Nations and anticipate that such a plan will assist our country and region in developing a coordinated emergency-aid structure of its own.\nSimilarly, Latvia joins other Members of the United Nations in a call for the repeal of resolution 3379 (XXX) of 10 November 1975 on Zionism. Latvia neither participated in nor supported this resolution at its inception and continues to oppose vigorously all policies that foster mistrust and antagonism between peoples and nations.\nThe people of Latvia have at long last navigated the stagnant, troubled waters of repression and aggression and have entered the open sea of international cooperation. We fully understand that even these seas can be rough and fraught with dangers, yet we take hope and comfort from the knowledge that we are joined on this journey by a world community committed to security, stability and economic prosperity. The Republic of Latvia stands ready to work with its friends and neighbours in meeting the challenges that lie ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, my country's delegation is proud to see you presiding over the current session of the General Assembly at a time when there is a pressing need for wisdom, skill and experience for which you have been known throughout your long diplomatic career. You represent Saudi Arabia, a country with which we are bound by ties of brotherhood, neighbourhood and common destiny and with which we share values of history, heritage, and the lofty principles of Islam. We are confident that you will conduct the work of this session with the competence and objectivity to which all Members of the Organisation are looking forward at this crucial juncture in history.\nWe commend the role played by the Foreign Minister of Malta, particularly his untiring endeavours to reform the organisational structure of the General Assembly during his presidency of the forty-fifth session. We hope that the efforts he exerted will continue.\nAfter 10 years of service in this prominent international post, during which the United Nations has witnessed momentous events, the world must feel proud of the role played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter and his continued efforts for peace have placed the United Nations at the centre of world events as an effective forum with moral and political weight.\nThis session convenes in the wake of a series of events which followed upon the heels of each other, and which led to radical changes in the ideological and political maps of many countries of the world. Some of those events, indeed most of them, took place suddenly and at a rapid pace, and as such, as the Secretary-General said in his annual report on the work of the Organization, they mark \\\"a great turning point in history\\\". (A/46/1, p. 2)\nOne of the most significant of those events was the disappearance of the system of polarisation associated with the cold war that plagued the world order since the inception of the United Nations. That polarization led at times to the brink of confrontation between the two super-Powers.\nThe ending of that polarization brought to an end the cold war with its military alliances and a policy of nuclear deterrence which was fraught with the risk of the mass annihilation of our globe. The changes in the ideological and political map of some countries of the world have been accompanied by, and resulted in, similar drastic changes in the relationships between the major Powers themselves as well as in their method of dealing with the existing hotbeds of conflict in many countries. Their approach is now based on cooperation rather than confrontation, on resolving regional conflicts rather than on fanning their flames, and on ending disputes rather than broadening their range. It is cooperation aimed at establishing international peace and security, and an alliance whose purpose is the repulsion of aggression and respect for the rights of countries to sovereignty and independence.\nIt was only natural that such positive developments should be reflected in the United Nations itself and the role entrusted to it. In this context, my country has supported the active role undertaken by the world Organization during the last two years in combating acts of aggression and in implementing the wide-ranging peace plans in many regions and countries. That role was a natural product of the new changes on the international scene and it corresponds fully with the mandate originally entrusted to the international Organization. It is the role that the United Nations should have played, had it not been for the cold war circumstances which precluded it.\nWhile we welcome those positive changes, we in the United Arab Emirates hope that excessive optimism will not make us forget or overlook the basic facts, namely that the world is still replete with hotbeds of tension that could erupt at any moment.\nThe new world order faced immediate challenges and hard tests, foremost among which was the Iraqi aggression against the State of Kuwait, as well as other events that have occurred in other areas of the world in the course of the past year. Those events serve as a reminder of the imperative to apply and adhere to international legality, particularly to implement fully Security Council resolutions on all issues without any discrimination between one problem or the other. It is imperative to address the hotbeds of tension and to confront them with promptness and effectiveness.\nWe seize this opportunity to extend our congratulations to the Government and people of the sisterly State of Kuwait on recovering its sovereignty and dislodging the occupiers of its land. We also congratulate the countries of the world on their solidarity and cooperation which played a major role in overcoming aggression and standing firm against the injustice meted out by the aggressor. We thank all the countries that participated with us materially, politically and morally in liberating Kuwait and ending aggression against the countries of the region.\nThis year's admission of seven countries to membership in the world Organization is a vivid expression of the success and progress the world has attained in its pursuit of peace. We avail ourselves of this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. We also extend special congratulations to Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania on regaining their independence and on their\n\naccession to the membership of this Organisation. My delegation will be happy to cooperate with them bilaterally and multilaterally in achieving the objectives of the Charter.\nThe crisis of the Iraqi aggression against, and occupation of Kuwait, ended with Kuwait's restoration of its sovereignty. However, the lessons drawn from that crisis will remain on the record of the political history of our region, which has always sought peace and stability. Our position in respect of that crisis was to uphold the rule of law, right and justice as well as standing by the inalienable right to self-defence against injustice and aggression.\nThe Iraqi regime miscalculated events and was driven by grudge, greed and aggression. Together with other countries, we tried to spare the region, and the people and land of Iraq, the calamities and consequences of war. International attempts to persuade Iraq to withdraw peacefully continued for over six months, but the Iraqi regime persisted in its aggression, leaving no other means but force.\nDuring those long months, the Kuwaiti people, under the yoke of occupation, were subjected to torture. Others Kuwaitis were scattered all around the world, enduring the humiliation of exile. The Iraqi regime was not content with all that: it also practised various types of blackmail, including hostage-taking, thus causing anguish to thousands of families.\nToday, while Kuwait has regained its sovereignty and resumed its role in the international community, the dire effects of that aggression are still palpable. It is evident that as a result crimes against humanity were committed, especially environmental crimes, where the Iraqi occupation forces pumped oil into the Gulf in order to destroy marine life in that vital waterway. The deliberate crime of setting fire to Kuwait's oil wells remains living proof of the recklessness with which that regime's aggression was imbued.\nWe applaud the efforts that were, and continue to be exerted by the Government of Kuwait to check the environmental devastation that resulted from the aggression. The Iraqi regime is fully responsible for the destruction of wealth and the wastage of resources resulting from its aggression.\nIraq's continuing detention of thousands of Kuwaiti citizens is a flagrant example of that regime's brutality, of its persistence in violating covenants and obligations and of its defiance of the international will.\nMy country wishes to see the relevant Security Council resolutions fully implemented in order to ensure that aggression will not recur. In cooperation with fraternal and friendly countries, we in the region seek to set up a mechanism to maintain security and stability, and make the Gulf a safe haven once again. We look forward to the support and cooperation of all of you to attain this lofty goal.\nIn our tireless endeavour to establish peace and maintain security in the Gulf, we cannot but admit that the security of the Middle East is an integral whole, and is linked to the causes and nature of conflicts in that region, which have been going on for five decades. Right from the outset, we realized that the delicate sensitivity that characterizes regional and international rivalries in the Middle East would inevitably lead to instability, and that it is difficult to separate the security of any one country or group of countries from the region's overall security.\nWe are pleased with the increasing international recognition of this fact, especially in light of the recent changes on the international scene, because people are now becoming convinced that there is a need to deal expeditiously and effectively with the principal conflict in the Middle East and with the core issue, the Palestinian question. We are hopeful that the current initiative by the American administration will succeed in convening the peace conference.\nWe believe that making peace will primarily depend on a continuing effort and on overcoming the obstacles Israel is still putting in the way of those endeavours, particularly its continuing building of settlements, which runs counter to the substance of the peace process and to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which call for the implementation of the principle of land for peace to be applied. Also, Israel has laid down stringent conditions regarding Palestinian representation, the status of Jerusalem and the United Nations role in that conference. The only aim of those conditions is to abort efforts to convene the conference so that Israel can shirk its responsibilities as an occupying Power and deny the Palestinian people the exercise of their right to self-determination.\nIt is therefore imperative for the fundamental principles for making peace to be affirmed; foremost of these is Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the establishment of their own independent state on their national soil.\nIn this respect, my delegation commends the recent resolutions adopted by the Palestine National Council. Those resolutions are a manifest expression of the Palestinian desire to respond with the present peace endeavours. We hope that this position will meet the appropriate response from all the parties concerned.\nWe welcome and support the efforts by the Lebanese Government to extend its sovereignty to all the territory of Lebanon. The President of Lebanon emphasised, in his statement before the General Assembly last week, the need\nto implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which provides for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Lebanese territory, especially now that the legitimate authority has been able to restore tranquillity and exercise its jurisdiction in all other areas of Lebanon.\nFor our part, we call on the international community, as represented by the Security Council, to implement that resolution. We also call upon all countries capable of extending a helping hand to do so, so that Lebanon can recover and reconstruct what the war has destroyed. We in the United Arab Emirates are fully willing to play our part in that endeavour, in cooperation with fraternal and friendly countries.\nIn South Africa, some aspects of the apartheid system have been abolished. These are the Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act and the Land Acts. While commending the abrogation of those laws, we note that the very basis of the apartheid system itself still exists. Moreover, many other laws that entrench that system have yet to be abrogated.\nPolitical stability and the continuation of international detente and cooperation are contingent upon the international order's ability to ride out the economic recession that continues to be a hurdle that blocks the entry of many of the world's peoples and countries upon the stage of economic development. A quick review of the performance of the world economy shows the size of the difficulties which face the economies of the developing countries as a result of the imbalance in the terms of trade, the debt crisis, the deteriorating prices of primary commodities and protectionism; also to be considered are the obstacles placed by some industrialised nations in the way of developing countries' exports, their monopolisation of modern technology and their marginalisation of the developing countries' role in the world economy.\nThese short-sighted policies contribute significantly to the obstruction of development programmes, which suffer from a shortage of resources and manpower, and are thus conducive to the intensification of economic and social crises. Though we realistically admit that the developing countries themselves bear the responsibility of removing those hurdles, we must admit also that the present international economic order is governed by a set of conditions that frustrate every effort made by those countries, which find themselves hemmed in by conditions and circumstances that are hard to cope with. Hence, the major economic powers have a significant role to play in supporting the efforts of those countries to create a more appropriate international economic climate.\nThe North-South dialogue, which has to be resumed, still constitutes the necessary starting point. The halting of that dialogue, regardless of the reasons for it, wasted precious time and opportunities for international development efforts, and we maintain that efforts must be renewed under the new set of International circumstances and conditions.\nIn that regard, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil next year, la a unique and auspicious opportunity for the world community to agree on a new agenda for comprehensive and sustainable international development in the interest of all mankind.\nAmong the basic lessons to be drawn from the Gulf crisis is the potential for devastation brought about by the acquisition of arms in general and weapons of mass destruction in particular. We all know the horror that could result from the use of such weapons in a highly volatile and extremely sensitive region.\nMy country has always been in favour of freeing the Middle East from weapons of mass destruction. We support the initiatives and efforts aimed at the prevention of producing, acquiring and stockpiling such weapons, and the destruction of those in stock.\nThe Israeli military arsenal, with its massive stockpiles of nuclear and chemical weapons still poses a real threat to stability and the prospects of making peace. Events have taught us that the acquisition of a certain weapon by any party provides the justification for others to acquire it. And when possession of such weapons by a State is associated with a policy of aggression, the danger is compounded. We therefore call for speedy action towards instituting the necessary procedures to eliminate such weapons.\nOn the international level, we welcome the agreements that have been made on arms reduction in Europe, the elimination of stocks of chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles. We hope that efforts and negotiations will continue towards freeing all areas of the world from weapons of mass destruction, and we welcome the recent agreement between Brazil and Argentina in this regard.\nIt is particularly appropriate to applaud the historic initiative taken a few days ago by the President of the United States, in which he announced the removal and elimination of all short-range nuclear weapons on land and sea in Europe and Asia. This initiative is a very advanced step in the process of disarmament and in mutual confidence-building.\nThe world, which has been able during the last few years to overcome many of the political problems that darkened international relations since the end of World War II and to solve many regional problems, must face up at this juncture to many newly emerging problems, particularly those of the grave degradation of the environment, worsening drug-trafficking and abuse, the problems of human rights and the attainment of social, economic and political justice in many societies.\nMankind should be the focus of our attention, since man is the means of development and the beneficiary of stability. Man's civil rights cannot be separated from his political rights, foremost of which are the right to self-determination and the right of all nations and peoples to enjoy respect for their heritage and culture. The end result of all this is the establishment of international cooperation on the basis of mutual respect in order to achieve well-being and prosperity for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLebanon comes to the United Nations this year, having overcome severe crises and devastating wars. This it has done thanks to the faithfulness of the Lebanese, their attachment to the country and their unity of will; to the support of sister Arab countries and other friendly nations; and to the United Nations, which has consistently supported Lebanon's right to sovereignty, independence and peace. May I take this opportunity to congratulate you, sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. You represent the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which we have profound ties of friendship and fraternity. Lebanon has always appreciated and continues to appreciate the Kingdom's contribution to the process by which we are extricating ourselves from war, under the leadership of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz.\n\nI wish to pay tribute to your predecessor - the President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session - and to express to the Secretary-General my deep appreciation of his genuine interest in Lebanon and of the distinguished role that the United Nations, under his leadership, has played in forging international cooperation. While welcoming the new States that have recently joined the United Nations, I wish to affirm today that Lebanon has broken out of the vicious circle of war that was imposed upon it, has begun to regain confidence in itself and to re-emerge on the world scene and play a unique role.\nOur Government's commitment to the letter and spirit of \\\"The National Conciliation Document\\\" has enabled our central Government, in only a few months, to re-establish the authority of the State and to remove the barriers that separated one area from another. The country has regained its unity and our citizens have rallied around the State. The militias have been dissolved and their guns have fallen silent. The State has eliminated the basic causes of the war and, therefore, of the existence of the militias that arose because of them. The State has now collected the weapons of the militias and outlawed the possession of weapons other than by legitimate authority.\nThe Lebanese Army and the internal security forces have been deployed in the capital and in the outlying areas. They have also been deployed in our steadfast South, side by side with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), with a view to extending the authority of the State there. We owe UNIFIL a great debt for the many sacrifices it has made in the performance of its noble mission.\nWe have reactivated State institutions and begun the process of restructuring them in the light of our urgent needs. We have revived national political life along democratic lines and affirmed our respect for all beliefs in the context of law and the national good. We have implemented political reforms and amended the Constitution accordingly. The Constitution has become more compatible with the principles of freedom, justice and equitable power-sharing.\nThe world today is moving rapidly towards cooperation and coordination among States. New blocs are emerging: Europe 1992, the Organisation of American States, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Union of the Arab Maghreb, are all examples of that trend. And the Lebanese, by nature open to others and anxious to cooperate, have recently ratified a Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination with Syria on the basis of mutual respect for the independence and sovereignty of each of the two States. In this context, Lebanon must express its gratitude for the great sacrifices that President Hafiz al-Assad has made in helping us realise national reconciliation and regain the authority of the State.\nThese are some of the achievements which brought Lebanon from despair to hope, from anarchy to order, and from fragmentation to unity. This transformation has been due largely to the character of our people. We are a peace-loving people that aspires after development. We are inclined by nature to conciliation in the context of democratic principles and respect for fundamental freedoms.\nWe have reinstated the State in Lebanon and the country now enjoys security and stability. But we still have much to do to eliminate the effects of the crises that engulfed our land, including the hostage crisis.\nThat crisis arose because of the prevalence of anarchy and the forced neutralization of Lebanese legitimate authority in large areas of the country for many years. Lebanon was among the first to condemn this phenomenon because it is in direct contradiction with our customs and traditions and with the basic principles of law and human rights. Indeed, Lebanon itself became a hostage to that alien phenomenon and its international repercussions. The Lebanese Government is determined to cooperate with all to put an end to this crisis. And the Government proved its determination when recently it foiled the plans of those who stand to lose frost the freeing of hostages and prisoners and the return to normalcy.\nThe Government of Lebanon has implemented moat of the provisions of \\\"The National Conciliation Document\\\" on which the Lebanese agreed in Taif, with the support of the League of Arab States, the sister Arab States, the members of the Arab Tripartite Committee, friendly nations, the international community and, in particular, the permanent members of the Security Council.\nBut the work is not over. One of the provisions that are yet to be implemented is the provision relating to the extension of the authority of the State to South Lebanon through our own forces in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (197R). This resolution upheld Lebanon's rights in the face of the Israeli occupation of vast parts of our South and Western Biqa'. Under resolution 425 (1978) the Security Council established UNIFIL to ensure the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from our internationally recognized borders and co ensure the return of the authority of the Lebanese State over that area.\nIt is natural, therefore, that we ask for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and insist on the separation of the problem of South Lebanon from the overall Middle East problem. We support all efforts to which our sister Arab States agree and are ready to facilitate all international endeavours aimed at a just, comprehensive and permanent peace in the Middle East.\nWe want our rights. Our people in the South suffer under the yoke of Israeli occupation and are continuously exposed to aggression, which threatens their lives, their property and their fundamental human rights. We have paid enough for the wars of others. Lebanon is the nation of coexistence, and peace for Lebanon means peace for all. \nAll peoples have a sacred right to their land and our land is particularly sacred due to the demographic composition of our people. Lebanon's pluralistic and demographic structure, which is its pride and claim to international attention, is deeply rooted in the very soil of Lebanon and does not permit of either partition or fragmentation of the north from the south or the east from the west. The peace process that has been launched will not be complete unless Israel withdraws fully and unconditionally from my country. Lebanon shall remain committed to realizing complete independence and undiminished sovereignty. \nHow is it acceptable that the Organization implement Security Council resolutions on the Middle East against a State which has challenged them, and yet not implement the resolution on Lebanon, which has never been the aggressor against Israel, which has continued to flout that resolution for 12 years and persisted in occupying with its army a part of Lebanon which is very dear to us? \nA positive response by the United Nations to Lebanon's request would constitute fulfilment of the Organization's commitments to my country and enhance the credibility of Security Council decisions, especially as the United Rations bad requested Lebanon, in 1989, to pursue steadfastly the implementation of the Taif Agreement which clearly provides for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978). Lebanon, a founding Member of the United Nations, and a participant in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, believes in international legitimacy and is intent on working within its principles and conventions.\nThe dangerous situation in the Middle East continues to threaten international peace and security. The Palestinians who reside in their own land are exposed to persecution and arrest. While massive Jewish immigration to Israel heightens existing fears, Israel in every way delays the resolution of the Palestinian problem and the exercise by the Palestinians of the right to self-determination. Israel's intransigent refusal to give peace efforts the chance they deserve, despite courageous Arab openness, shows that it is wrong to assume that a permanent, just and comprehensive peace could be established on the basis of oppression and persecution.\nMy country, which has suffered greatly from the Arab-Israeli conflict in general, and from the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in particular, has a special stake in the search for a comprehensive, stable and just settlement in the Middle East. The Lebanese model, founded on diversity, dialogue and openness, provides useful lessons for constructive coexistence in the region.\nNow that security has been re-established and confidence in Lebanon has been restored, our emigrants are gradually returning home and sharing in reconstruction. Me also look forward to the support of sister Arab States and friendly nations for our reconstruction plans. Peace cannot be fully realized apart from a developmental process aimed at guaranteeing social equity and human dignity.\nThe long war in Lebanon has destroyed our vital resources and adversely affected our economy and infrastructures. The State budget is under the burden of heavy debts. For the past 15 years, several major sources of our national income - such as services and tourism - have suffered heavily. In addition, regional crises, the latest of which was the Gulf War, have had detrimental effects on Lebanon.\nThe Lebanese Government, therefore, faces many challenges in many sectors. It is determined, however, to restore normalcy. This determination stems from our confidence in the viability of Lebanon's free enterprise system, our mainstay in our drive to rebuild the country. We also rely on the constructive role of Lebanese businessmen abroad, the cooperation of the United Nations and other international organisations side by side with our own efforts.\nWe are in the process of drawing the initial plans for the reconstruction of the whole of Lebanon beginning with the capital, Beirut, and we are also working on returning all displaced Lebanese to their homes, properties and villages. Beirut, the cultural and commercial centre of the Middle East, solicits Arab and international investments throughout Lebanon. Lebanon has received aid from some Arab States and from some organizations, but what it really needs is the creation of an international fund for the reconstruction of Lebanon with the participation in that fund of the United Nations, of international organizations and of the industrialized nations.\nIf, for 15 years, the world stood by and watched Lebanon undergo one crisis after another, it is not right that the world should now stand by and merely watch Lebanon face alone the challenge of revival and reconstruction. Lebanon's determination to end the state of war and to deal with the consequences that arose there from testify to its ability to re-emerge and to regenerate itself. Wherever the Lebanese people have settled - be it in the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Gulf or Australia - they have contributed to development. Those very Lebanese deserve your participation in the development and reconstruction of their own country.\nMoreover, the international community has never failed to provide assistance to any war-ravaged country. Are not solidarity with such countries and participation in their development at the very basis of the founding of the United Nations and in the forefront of its objectives?\nLebanon looks forward to the emergence of a new political era on the eve of the twenty-first century, an era of cooperation in furthering the progress of humanity, of brotherhood, of respect for the rights of others and of freedom, security and prosperity. A peaceful Lebanon has a unique cultural mission in its region and in the world. Peace in Lebanon is also in the interest of its sister Arab States and of world peace. Lebanon's commitment to freedom, peace and development is such that it will never give up the struggle for their realization.\nTo attain a prosperous future for the region, need to cooperate in the contest of a new political order whose features are gradually taking shape as a consequence of brave Arab decisions. The new political order will be founded on the qualities of understanding, pluralism and tolerance in our  \nculture, and on the realisation by all concerned that the future of the Middle East should be based on stability, freedom and human dignity.\nThe recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic arms limitations constitute a first step towards the liberation of humanity from the bane of nuclear terror. We hope that this process will continue to include chemical and bacteriological weapons and to render the Middle East an area free of weapons of mass destruction.\nMy country also supports efforts to resolve regional conflicts throughout the world through open and constructive dialogue. Those efforts have been successful in a number of areas. They also enjoy wide international support and enhance the growing role of the United Nations in restoring peace and normalcy in hitherto intractable conflicts.\nLebanon affirms its readiness to participate in the 1990s in furthering cooperation among the nations of the world in all fields and endeavours.\nIn spite of 15 years of the daily threat of death, my country did not die. On the contrary, it has emerged with a new determination to exist and to prosper. Lebanon stands out as an example of the will to survive, with its message of forgiveness and conciliation, it reaffirms that it is a source of pride both for itself and for the world at large, that its very name, Lebanon, is not synonymous with violence and strife, but with construction, creativity and open and peaceful interaction with the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great pleasure, that on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Sierra Leone, I congratulate Mr. Samir Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. This is deserved testimony to, and appreciation of, his proven qualities and skills as a seasoned diplomat and a worthy son of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country with which we have always maintained cordial and friendly relations. Let me assure him of my delegation's fullest cooperation as the Assembly, under his leadership, forges ahead in the search for solutions to the problems confronting us. I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Guido De Marco, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, under whose efficient direction the forty-fifth session made much progress.\nThe principle of universality, for long the aim of the Charter, gained added significance with the recent admission of seven States, including Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, into our midst. For them, membership must be the fulfilment of an aspiration to the attainment of self-determination. Similarly, we extend a hand of welcome and cooperation to the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, whose independence and territorial integrity have been restored. These States have once again become vibrant actors on the international stage. We equally welcome the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, an outcome that my Government had consistently supported over the past few years. It is our belief and hope that their presence in this international forum will be used to further their shared goal of eventual reunification. We congratulate all the new Members and note that by their membership the social and cultural diversity of the Organization is further enriched.\nWe meet at this forty-sixth session on the crest of a tidal wave of significant developments, whose ramifications are yet to be fully understood. Poised as we are on what promises to be a new era, we must admit that these are exciting, yet challenging, times: exciting, because they offer an opportunity for a change in direction, or even new beginnings, in the conduct of international relations; challenging, because of the possible consequences of a wrong choice.\nIt has been said in this very Hall that we cannot allow the emerging world order to evolve by itself. We must fashion it, nurture it and imbue it with those qualities or characteristics that will best serve us in the coming years. The nascent world order must therefore be seen as an offspring of our collective volition and effort. Consequently, the overriding premise should be that the prerequisites of such a new world order must be clearly understood and the rights, duties and obligations of States within the context of its application must be clearly spell out. What we must fashion is not a tenuous arrangement of uneven quality, but a compact of free nations, whose conduct will truly be sanctioned by the Charter and held accountable to the peoples of the world. \nInvariably, the outcome of our efforts will depend largely on whether we are determined to make an auspicious start, whether we are resolved to shed those attitudes which have hitherto frustrated conflict resolution, inhibited peace-making or stifled economic development. We must be convinced of the efficacy of a progressively liberal and democratic approach whose underpinnings should be political flexibility, social compromise and clear economic vision.\nThe situation in South Africa has been one of our agenda items for many years now. As a result of sustained internal and international pressure, the present South African Administration has enacted legislation to remove certain obnoxious laws from the statute books. However, apartheid is still firmly rooted in that country, and therefore it will be an error of judgement on our part if we fail to maintain pressure on the South African Government.\nPresident De Klerk's constitutional proposals are designed above all to ensure that the majority of the people will never be able to exercise effective political power. Clearly, one cannot take seriously a system that makes it mandatory for a coalition Government to be formed irrespective of the outcome of elections. These proposals cannot form the basis for negotiations. At the same time, evidence has come to light confirming the suspicion of many that the Pretoria regime continues to coordinate the destructive wave of violence engulfing South Africa, particularly the African townships. The international community must continue to be vigilant and sustain pressure on the South African regime until the majority of the people of that country are able to determine how and by whom they should be governed. The retention of constitutional safeguards is one thing, but the perpetration of racism cannot be tolerated. \nWe are elated at the ongoing peace process in Angola and the cessation of hostilities between the warring parties, and we look forward to the emergence of a united Angolan people. We call upon the people of Mozambique to end the bloody conflict that has wrought so much suffering on the poor and innocent, particularly the women and children. We laud the efforts of all countries, particularly those of the subregion, in their bid to find a solution to the crisis in that country.\nWith reference to the problems in Western Sahara, we see in the United Nations Mission a final step on the road to resolving the conflict in that territory.\nOver the years, my delegation has paid tribute to the courage, patience and fortitude of the Cambodian people in their adversity. Today we witness the result of those qualities in the establishment of a Supreme National Council under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which crystallizes the consensus of the Cambodian people to come to terms with the future direction of their society in order to resume their place on the international scene.\nWe are convinced that the healing process, after years of conflict, has begun, and with it will come the realization that the lessons of the past will forge the Cambodian people's determination as they march towards their destiny.\nMy delegation welcomes the convening of an international conference on the Middle East which will address the Palestinian question and the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. It has always been the view of this delegation that the Palestinians are entitled to a homeland within secure borders, where they can exercise their inalienable rights as a people. Therefore it should be the objective of all participants at that conference to achieve a comprehensive peace settlement that will ensure that all the countries of that region live in peace with one another within secure borders.\nMany people now agree that the African crisis is basically political in nature, with serious economic and social consequences. It is against that background that my President, Major-General Dr. Joseph Saidu Momoh, in August last year set the scene for greater participation in politics by the people of Sierra Leone as well as a greater democratisation of the political process. After 13 years of one-party rule, a multi-party constitution is now in place, and at the next election, scheduled to take place within a year, the people of Sierra Leone will have the opportunity of choosing those whom they would want to govern them. However, for multi-party democracy to function effectively, Governments in our situation must be assisted to eradicate hunger, poverty and illiteracy, as the continued existence of deprivation of the majority of our peoples is likely to impact negatively on the democratic process.\nWhile Sierra Leoneans rejoice at the smooth and peaceful transition from a single-party to a multi-party constitution, our country continues to be invaded by rampaging bandits of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia. This aggression has resulted in the loss of lives of thousands of our people and the displacement of many more, thereby compounding the serious refugee problem we already have.\nWe believe in the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all nations, irrespective of their size and wealth. Our participation in the United Nations coalition against Iraq following the latter's invasion of Kuwait last year is an eloquent demonstration of our belief in the preservation of the territorial integrity of States. Sierra Leone is, therefore determined to repel the invasion of the eastern and southern parts of its territory by the marauding bandits of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia and appeals to the international community for support to alleviate the suffering of both our displaced citizens and the refugees from Liberia. We should also like to place on record our appreciation of the tremendous assistance rendered to us by the Governments of the Republic of Guinea, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom and other friendly countries.\nIn a new world economic order where we see progress, achievement, growth and self-sufficiency in other parts of the world, we in Africa, particularly in the sub-Saharan region, continue to be marginalized, with our ailing economies deteriorating by geometrical progression. We continue to flounder in external debts, and there appears to be a calculated intention to keep us submerged. Programmes intended to salvage our economies and serve as a panacea for our economic woes meet with little or no support from the international community. Therefore they fail, and they fail dismally at that. A case in point is the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which at its launching had every indication of being a viable and potentially successful economic recovery programme. Today, four years after its inception, many African countries are mired in more economic difficulties than ever before.\nOur Heads of State, at their meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, last June, signed a Treaty establishing an African economic community with the objective of creating opportunities for economic development through coopers on. He shall fall again in this venture if the requisite international economic atmosphere is not created. There is therefore an urgent need for a volte-face by the developed nations in their attitude towards some or all of the causes of our economic problems as we see them: low commodity prices, a heavy external-debt burden, limited transfer of resources and technology, and emerging protectionist trade blocs. He call upon the developed countries to integrate the economies of our countries into the multilateral trade system, thus creating an opportunity for our impaired economies to establish productive trade links with more buoyant ones.\nTo this end, we need, among other things, a re-examination of the increasingly difficult international economic environment prevailing at the moment. It is my delegation's view that if an improvement in the world's economy is to be assured the international community must recognize the need for concerted action. Many countries in Africa have embarked on the process of stabilizing their economies and introducing structural adjustment programmes. This process is no doubt a painful one for the majority of our people, who have to contend with reduced social services. It is therefore essential that the question of the debt burden and other related issues affecting the developing countries be seriously examined.\nIt is widely accepted that, for Africa, the last decade was a lost decade. Now that there is an improved climate of political cooperation, we need to pursue very actively and constructively the North-South dialogue on burning economic issues. Even if the entire world were at peace, we could not afford to look on helplessly an, every day, a large part of the population of our planet goes to sleep hungry.\nThe International community is currently engaged in a debate about protection of the environment. This comes after years of indifference to the ravages that man has wrought on his surroundings.\nAdmittedly, across the entire spectrum, rather intense views are being voiced about the extent of certain aspects of environmental degradation - what activities are the most destructive; the impact of a comprehensive environmental regime on development, particularly in the developing countries; and how a radical environment-oriented development system should be underwritten. These are all pertinent aspects of an issue that should be addressed seriously. While we may differ in respect of certain areas, there is one point that we cannot argue against - that the environment is not only our common heritage but also a legacy that we shall bequeath to our children. That being the case, we have an insuperable obligation to engage in activities that win contribute both to our well-being and, indeed, to our survival. It is against this background that the Sierra Leone delegation regards the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, as being crucial to our interests.\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, observes that for the entire human race the stakes in the forthcoming conference are high. We agree with this view, and we expect the consensus emerging from those negotiations to encompass clearly designed long-term strategies that will enable developing countries like ours to obtain the technological and material capability to deal with the deleterious effects of poverty and to embark on environmentally sound and sustainable development practices. It is our hope that this conference will not lead to a further marginalization of the developing countries and, above all, that it will address seriously those aspects of this issue that are of particular concern to us.\nBefore ending my statement I should like to commend the Secretary General and his staff for their untiring efforts to help us to achieve the alms and objectives of our Organisation. Mr. Peirez de Cuellar has rendered outstanding service to the United Nations for 20 years - during the last 10, as Secretary-General. During these years significant events have affected the Organization in a fundamental way. The retreat from multilateralism has subsided somewhat, and the Organization has preoccupied the centre stage in international relations. My delegation extends sincere best wishes to Mr. Perez de Cuellar as he leaves us. His selfless service will go down in the annals of our Organization.\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall these words of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session:\n\\\"With its return from the doldrums, and with its role no longer peripheral, the United Nations has come nearer to the vision of its Charter.\\\" (A/46/1, p. 22)\nSierra Leone shares these sentiments and commits itself to working closely with others to achieve the objectives of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin. Sir, by offering you the warmest congratulations of the delegation of the Union of Myanmar on your most deserving election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Allow me also to express our admiration for the able manner in which you have been leading the deliberations of this body since the beginning of the session, and our full confidence that under your wise and dynamic leadership every success will attend the work of the session.\nIn addition, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, for his commendable and invaluable contribution to the success of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nOur high tribute and deep appreciation go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, too, for his tireless efforts, his dedication to the ideals and aims of the United Nations, his courageous and far-sighted peace initiatives and, above all, his vital contribution in restoring the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations at this critical juncture in the history of the Organization.\nUniversality of membership is a cherished goal of our Organization - an objective which Myanmar has always supported. We are therefore pleased to see seven new Members in our midst.\nTwo among the new members, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have been with us for many years as Observer States. We are pleased to see them assume their rightful place as full Members. The Republic of Korea is a country with which Myanmar has established a long and fruitful relationship of friendship, understanding and cooperation, and I am therefore most delighted to welcome it to our midst. We are confident that, given the evolving international climate, the simultaneous admission of the two Korean States will promote rather than hinder their eventual peaceful reunification.\nWe are also pleased to see in our ranks two other fellow-Asian States, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Their decision to join our Organization signifies their resolve to take full charge of their own destiny as independent sovereign States.\nThe assumption of their rightful place among us by the three Baltic States - the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania - carries a special significance because it represents the righting of a historical wrong perpetrated in violation of international law. Equally significant is the manner in which this was accomplished. If I may borrow from the statement made by the President of the Security Council on 12 September 1991 on behalf of the members of the Council, the independence of these three States: \\\"... was restored peacefully, by means of dialogue, with the consent of the parties concerned, and in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of the three peoples\\\". (S/PV.3007. p. 4-5)\nThe threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State is totally outlawed by the Charter. So is the threat or use of force in any other manner, save in conformity with the provisions of Article 51 and Chapter VII. Acts of aggression, or other breaches of the peace, whenever, wherever or by whomsoever committed, must be decisively suppressed. It is therefore a matter for satisfaction that the Security Council, freed at last from its decades-long paralysis, took resolute action to terminate Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, and thereby succeeded in upholding intact one of the principal aims of the Charter. The entire world\nrejoiced at the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation and the restoration of the status quo ante in that country.\nWhile the legitimacy of the objective of Security Council decisions in the matter is unquestionable, certain aspects of those decisions and the manner in which they were interpreted and implemented not only during the war but also in its aftermath have confronted the international community with many troubling questions. The Secretary-General has laid these questions plainly before the Member States in chapter IV of his annual report. The Council's decision authorizing the use of force on a national and coalition basis, which clearly does not conform with the mechanism and procedures for enforcement action envisaged in Chapter VII; the apparent lack of proportionality in the employment of armed force; the want of full compliance with the rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts; the over-extension of the application of Chapter VII measures; the continued enforcement of some of these measures long after the end of hostilities which has caused grievous suffering to innocent civilian populations - these are among the questions which must be urgently addressed not only by the Security Council but also by the General Assembly in exercise of its authority under Article 11 of the Charter.\nThe peculiar phenomenon of the cold war which took hold in the wake of the universal rejoicing and euphoria occasioned by the end of the Second World War has now been declared over. Thus, an unhappy chapter in human history, which was also the most perilous, has come to a close. Mankind, which for over forty-five agonizing years has been living under the sinister shadow of the atom bomb, has been liberated from the ever-present and pervasive threat of total and instant annihilation. The nations of the world have now within their grasp a God-sent opportunity to fashion a new international order in the image of the Charter - a new order of peace, freedom, justice and cooperation, where the rule of law, not the rule of might, prevails; an order where both men and nations are freed from the crushing scourges of want, hunger, disease and ignorance that have afflicted mankind through the ages. The end of an old era does not necessarily mean the dawn of a new and better one, and the transition from the one to the other can be neither smooth nor painless. It can be accomplished only through the conscious and dynamic pursuit of enlightened, responsible and statesman-like policies by all nations, particularly by those that have the power to influence and shape events - for good or for bad, for better or for worse. In today's changing and turbulent world it is doubly incumbent on such countries to exercise their great power with prudence and in strict conformity with international law. Power entails responsibility, and the greater the power the higher is the responsibility to act, and to be seen to act, with justice and within the law. Power divorced from responsibility and exercised outside the law - be it at the global or at the regional level - will inevitably lead to an international regime of diktat and anarchy.\nThe Charter of the United Nations lays down the legal norms of responsible international behaviour and provides the institutional framework for just the kind of international order that not only nations but countless millions of common men and women in all corners of the globe have so long yearned for and so long been denied. Nothing that has happened since the watershed year of 1985, when events that will surely go down in history as marking the beginning of the end of the cold war first manifested themselves, requires a modification of the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter. Indeed, if anything has become plain from the rapid evolution of international affairs it is that the paramount law of the Charter must be upheld as inviolate and must be scrupulously respected in every sphere of intercourse between nations if today's promise is not to become tomorrow's bad dream. As the Secretary-General reminds us in the opening section of his annual report of 1991,. \\\"... the concern that t>\u00bbe principles of its Charter should govern the emerging international order continues and is accentuated by all current developments\\\". (A/46/1, p.2)\nAmong the developments that are causing serious concern and anxiety, particularly among the small and the weak, are moralistic stances that, in truth, conceal attempts to modify the time-honoured concept of sovereignty and to erode certain cardinal principles of the Charter, such as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, the principle of respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of States, and the principle of the sovereign equality of States.\nOne sphere where such attempts are becoming increasingly manifest is that of the promotion of human rights. We in Myanmar accept the rule that once legal norms pertaining to human rights are universally recognized as general principles of international law they become binding on all States. Indeed, we are adhering to such norms in good faith. To the fullest extent permitted by our own national circumstances - not least among which is the continued existence of armed insurrection in remote parts of the country and the destructive activities of underground elements in urban and rural areas - we are doing our utmost to promote and protect fundamental human rights in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Myanmar Government's policy of cooperating with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is well known to members of that Commission. Not only have we been providing comprehensive and factual replies to inquiries and communications of the Commission, received through the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, but we have welcomed the visit to our country of an independent expert appointed by the Commission. We intend to continue such cooperation on the basis of the principles underlying the United Nations human-rights mechanism - namely, objectivity, fair-play, good faith and good will.\nHowever, a clear line must be drawn between, on one hand, the internationally binding character of the norms I have mentioned and, on the other hand, the modality of their implementation by Member States in their own countries. The modality of implementation is the primary responsibility of Member States, to be formulated by each according to its own best judgement, in keeping with its own local conditions. In this respect, the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies can best play a supportive role. Here the wise words of caution expressed by the Secretary-General in his latest annual report must be well heeded. Speaking of human-rights violations carried out in a systematic fashion and on a scale massive in terms of both time and place, the Secretary-General says:\n\\\"It seems to be beyond question that violations of human rights imperil peace, while disregard of the sovereignty of States would spell chaos. The maximum caution needs to be exercised lest the defence of human rights becomes a platform for encroaching on the essential domestic jurisdiction of States and eroding their sovereignty. Nothing would be a surer prescription for anarchy than an abuse of this principle.\\\" (A/46/1, p. 10)\nAs a South-East Asian nation, Myanmar is highly gratified that fighting has ceased in neighbouring Cambodia and that an end to the pain and suffering endured by the Cambodian people over the past 12 years is now in sight. The successful formation of the Supreme National Council, with His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk as its President, and the subsequent Pattaya and New York agreements reached between the Cambodian parties represent significant progress towards implementation of the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia, endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 668 (1990) of 20 September 1990.\nWe fervently hope that all parties concerned will pursue the process with renewed vigour, so that a comprehensive peace agreement may be finalized and concluded without delay.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains highly volatile. The Gulf War served as a frightening reminder of the potential for a wider, more devastating conflict in the region. My delegation continues to hold that a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region can be achieved only by faithful application of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in their entirety. This requires, above all, recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, including their inalienable right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent and sovereign State, side by side with recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States in the region, including Israel. My delegation further believes that an international peace conference on the Middle East, held under United Nations auspices and with the participation, on an equal footing throughout all its phases, of all parties concerned, remains the best means of achieving the kind of peace I have mentioned. We earnestly hope that the diplomatic initiatives that were intensified in the aftermath of the Gulf War will lead to agreement on the early convening of such a conference.\nWe have followed with great concern developments in South Africa, where the black majority continues to make tremendous sacrifices in order to free itself from the scourge of apartheid. While steps such as the repeal of the Group Areas Act and the Lands Act, the repeal of the Population Registration Act and the promise of President De Klerk to remove the remaining pillars of apartheid are positive, it is disappointing that, almost two years after the adoption of the United Nations consensus Declaration on apartheid, the political process towards the elimination of the abhorrent system is still at a very early stage. We are happy to note that, as a result of the courage and political vision of the black leadership, the parties concerned reached agreement on 14 September 1991 to put an end to the communal violence that has engulfed South Africa for so long.\nThere is today a historic opportunity for the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa, united and free from apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination. We must not let the opportunity slip away. It is imperative that the international community, while applauding the constructive developments there, continue to maintain the necessary pressure until the evil system is totally eradicated.\nThe new climate of growing confidence and cooperation between the two super-Powers presents us with an opportunity to intensify efforts that would result in meaningful agreements in all fields of disarmament, particularly in the field of nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.\nIn the nuclear field, the package of measures announced by President Bush last Friday has given a further boost to the momentum generated by the 1987 Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty) and the 1991 START agreement. What is perhaps more significant than the numbers and types of weapons involved is what seems to be a clean break with the philosophical approach to arms control and disarmament which the United States pursued during the cold-war era. A positive Soviet response, both in kind and in spirit, to the unilateral United States initiative could, in our view, set in train a self-generating process that would eventually lead to the elimination of all types of nuclear weapons in the armouries of all nuclear-weapon States.\nAs we enter the decade of the 1990s, little has changed in the economic circumstances of the developing countries. In the midst of plenty, the vast majority of developing countries still find themselves in a state of abject poverty. While world trade has shown healthy growth, the same cannot be said of the foreign trade of developing countries, and while foreign direct investment quadrupled in the last decade, very little of it flowed to the developing countries. The absolute level of official financial flows to the developing countries remains stagnant in real terms.\nThe international trading system continues to be threatened by growing protectionism and increased tendencies towards managed trade, and frequent recourse to unilateral measures which contravene the basic principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The developing countries are faced with protectionist measures in developed market economies affecting the very sectors where developing countries have a distinct comparative advantage in international competitiveness.\nThe debt crisis, far from being over, has increased in magnitude and intensity. Although a few middle-income debtor countries have achieved a measure of progress, the most heavily indebted countries continue to face enormous difficulties. The total amount of external debt of capital-importing countries has now reached the staggering sum of $1.4 trillion.\nResolving the debt crisis is central to the reactivation of growth and development in the developing countries. The solution to the problem of external indebtedness must of necessity include debt and debt-servicing reduction as a central element. While recent initiatives do provide limited scope for debt relief, a durable solution to the problem will require bolder approaches.\nThat over a billion people now live in absolute poverty is not only immoral: it also poses a real threat to international security and stability. Creation of an international economic environment conducive to growth and development of the developing countries is therefore an imperative for the world community. Unless and until this is achieved, the chasm that divides the North from the South will grow even wider.\nIn less than a year the nations of the world will gather in Brazil for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The outcome of the summit Conference, the first of its kind ever to be formally mandated by the General Assembly, will have a most significant bearing on the future of mankind. The actual and potential threats posed by environmental degradation and deterioration are such that unless timely action is taken at the global, regional and national levels the very survival of the human race is at stake.\nWhat is required is a willingness on the part of all nations, developed and developing, to work together in cooperation and in concert so that the threat to the environment can be overcome. The wide spectrum of issues that need to be addressed include the unsustainable pattern of production and consumption, new and additional sources of funding for the developing countries to enable them to cope with environmental problems, and development of and agreement on technological transfers.\nThe environment occupies a place of pride in our national priorities. Allow me, therefore, to apprise the Assembly of the endeavours of my country in the field of environmental protection. Myanmar has great biodiversity, in flora as well as fauna. We regard them as a national heritage to be protected and conserved for future generations. Accordingly, environmental considerations have consistently been taken into account in our socio-economic planning and implementation.\nMyanmar's abundant forests, a resource of considerable economic value, have been managed on a rational and sustainable basis. To accomplish this the Government has been implementing a series of five-year forest plans. Central to this is the time-tested method of environmentally sound timber extraction commonly known as the Myanmar selection system. This is complemented by a significant reforestation programme, carried out by the Forest Department as well as by the public at large. The sixth five-year plan, for the period 1992 to 1996, envisages a five-fold increase in the area of natural forest reserves.\nThe setting up of the National Commission for Environmental Affairs in February 1990 has also enabled Myanmar to enhance its environmental endeavours both nationally and internationally. The National Commission, which has jurisdiction over all environmental .natters, coordinates the environmental efforts of various ministries and departments. It also acts as a national focal point for environmental matters vis-\u00e0-vis other countries and international organizations.\nThe union of Myanmar is stepping up its campaign against drug abuse - which has become the foremost social problem in the world today - at the national, bilateral and international levels.\nAt the national level, the Myanmar authorities, during 1991, in continuation of their narcotic-drugs-supply-reduction activities, conducted a public destruction of narcotic drugs in Yangon on 1 July. Earlier in the year, at a series of special occasions attended by diplomats and military attaches accredited to Myanmar, representatives of various United Nations agencies and of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, and the international media, 1,500 acres of poppy fields together with four drug refineries and large quantities of narcotic drugs and drug-producing paraphernalia were destroyed on site. The total value of drug refineries, paraphernalia, narcotic drugs and poppy fields destroyed in public from 1990 to date is approximately $4.33 billion. Drug-supply-reduction activities being carried out in my country also include destruction of poppy fields: between 1975 and 1991 over 200,000 acres of poppy fields, with a potential annual yield of 940 tonnes of opium, were destroyed.\nThe magnitude of Myanmar's contribution to the international campaign against narcotic drugs cannot be measured in monetary terms alone. In terms of lives saved and of human misery and social problems averted in drug-affected foreign countries, the magnitude of our contribution is immeasurably higher and cannot, indeed, be quantified.\nA novel approach that we have adopted as an integral part of the comprehensive campaign against drug abuse has been to win the hearts and minds of the local populace in the poppy-growing areas and to secure their willing and wholehearted cooperation in achieving the total eradication of poppy cultivation. Significant results have already been achieved in this respect also. The programme for the development of border areas and national races therein that is now being implemented is fully supportive of our national anti-drug campaign efforts, and we believe that the programme will contribute effectively to the total and early eradication of poppy cultivation.\nAt the bilateral level, our active cooperation with neighbouring countries in drug-abuse control is making significant headway. Following two rounds of discussion in which representatives of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme participated, an agreement for Myanmar-Thailand cooperation on a wide range of anti-narcotics activities was signed by representatives of the two Governments in March this year. Later, in May, a similar agreement was entered into with China on the conclusion of high-level discussions held in Beijing in which the representatives of the Myanmar and Chinese Governments and the Executive Director of the United Nations Drug Control Programme took part. In September talks were initiated in Yangon between Myanmar and Laotian representatives on matters relating to bilateral cooperation in drug-abuse control. These will b\u00ab continued in Vientiane in the near future. As these bilateral arrangements for cooperation progress and become increasingly concretised, we hope to raise them to the subregional level involving all four countries and covering the crucial Golden Triangle area as well as all areas contiguous to it.\nAt the international level, Myanmar's accession to the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances marks an important milestone in the history of our endeavours to combat the menace of illicit drugs, and our participation in the international campaign against this horrible scourge.\nWith all these concrete measures and tangible results behind us and with definite future plans effectively to eradicate the drug menace, we in Myanmar are confident that we shall in the near future win a resounding and decisive victory in our war on illicit drugs. In so doing, we hope that Myanmar will be able to make a significant contribution to the success of the world-wide efforts to combat the scourge of illicit drugs, rendering an invaluable service to mankind.\nJust as the world stands at the crossroads of change and transformation, we in Myanmar find ourselves on the threshold of a new era. At this important juncture, the Government of Myanmar is undertaking a wide range of endeavours to usher in a process leading to peace and prosperity and the fulfilment of the aspirations of the people to a democratic State. In the past year, significant progress has been made in restoring law and order throughout the country and in laying the foundations for a democratic State. That all schools, colleges, universities and other institutions of higher learning have now been reopened attests to the return to normality in the entire country. Complete freedom of religion continues to be promoted in the country. With the active support of the Government, religious groups of diverse faiths are flourishing as never before, which gives the lie to the fallacious allegations being spread by certain quarters with ulterior motives. An unprecedented event, which contributes to consolidating stability in the country, has been the return to the legal fold of eight insurgent groups. Having renounced the path of violence, they have now joined hands with the Government and the people to transform their respective areas into thriving and prosperous communities. For the first time in decades, guns have fallen silent and peace and tranquillity now prevail in remote areas of the country where terror and lawlessness previously reigned.\nQuestions have been raised in some quarters about the perceived delay in the transfer of power. Some have even gone so far as to assert that the Myanmar Government has shown no sign of respecting the wishes of the people. Without prejudice to the firmly held position of my Government that the\npolitical process now under way in the country is a matter falling essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of my country - a principle clearly enshrined in the Charter - I should like to apprise the Assembly of the facts.\nTwo months after the successful holding of multi-party elections in May 1990, which were recognized by all as the most free and fair elections in the history of Myanmar, the State Law and Order Restoration Council on 27 July 1990 issued Declaration 1/90 setting forth a post-election programme. All political parties have agreed to abide by the programme.\nThe Election Commission, which is an independent body, issued two progress reports this year in which it indicated that it was continuing with its task of concluding a final report in accordance with the Election Law and the election rules and that the scrutiny of the financial returns of the candidates could not proceed at a more rapid rate owing to the failure of candidates to maintain accounts systematically. In accordance with the election law, a number of candidates have contested the results, and tribunals have been set up to investigate the objections. This due process of law must be allowed to complete its course.\nOnce the Election Commission has submitted its final report, the State Law and Order Restoration Council will meet with the elected representatives to discuss the holding of a national convention. The convention will be entrusted with the task of working out a broad national consensus, which will form the basis for framing a new constitution. In addition to the elected representatives, leaders of political parties, leaders and representatives of all national races and respected veteran politicians will participate in the convention.\nOn the basis of the national consensus arrived at the convention, the elected representatives will draw up a new constitution. The State Law and Order Restoration Council, in the best traditions of the Myanmar Defence Services, will make suggestions and render all necessary assistance for the successful drafting and adoption of an enduring constitution. The State Law and Order Restoration Council is above party politics. It is not a political organization nor does it have any intention of forming one. It will continue to shoulder its responsibility to lead the nation until the time a strong government can be formed on the basis of the new constitution.\nUndoubtedly, a strong and enduring constitution is a prerequisite for a strong and stable government, the more so in Myanmar because of its historical experiences. The first Constitution, drawn up in 1947 while Myanmar was still under British colonial rule, had flaws and shortcomings. In the early 1960s, a few politicians with secessionist ambitions attempted to take advantage of them. As a result the country was brought to the brink of disintegration in 1962 and the Defence Services were compelled to step in to save it.\nThe second Constitution was promulgated in 1974, during the time of the one-party socialist system. The entire people took part in the thorough and systematic process, which lasted over two years. The final text was adopted in a nation-wide referendum on 3 January 1974 by an overwhelming vote of 90.19 per cent. Notwithstanding this, the Constitution was short-lived and was rendered inoperative in 1988, when, in response to the aspirations of the people, the State Law and Order Restoration Council abolished the single-party system and introduced a multi-party democratic system.\nIn the light of these experiences, it goes without saying that the new constitution now being contemplated should be a living instrument reflecting the hopes and aspirations of this generation as well as generations to come. At this critical stage in the life of my country, the constitutional process is an undertaking to be pursued in a peaceful, systematic and orderly manner. It is a task that can be best accomplished by the people of Myanmar itself at a pace and in a manner best suited to the conditions of the country.\nIn conclusion I should like to state categorically that, once the political process I have outlined is completed, the State Law and Order Restoration Council will transfer the reins of the State to a strong and stable government formed in accordance with the new constitution.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly has opened at a very special time in the history of the United Nations and of the human race. Forty-six years after this Organization was established an astonishing speeding-up of history is under way. The arms race seems to be ending at last and the cold war is over. Everywhere in Central and Eastern Europe, political liberalization in just a few months has changed the frozen relationships which were undeniable realities over the last 45 years. Africa and Eastern Europe are opening up to freedom and democracy. The pillars of apartheid are now crumbling and Africa is resolved more than ever before to take its place in the international arena.\nIn other words, Sir, you assume the presidency of the General Assembly under very special circumstances which bring many hopes with them. The delegation of Togo, through me, would like to congratulate you sincerely on your election to the presidency of this forty-sixth session. This wise choice, besides being a tribute to your country for its devotion to peace and justice, is a recognition of your experience in international affairs and of your intellectual and human qualities. I assure you that all the members of my delegation will cooperate with you fully and work with you to ensure the success of your mission.\nMy delegation would like to say to your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Malta, how pleased we were at the effective and able manner in which he presided over the work of the forty-fifth session. He would like to commend him most sincerely once again.\nWe also wish to pay a well deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his efforts on behalf of peace and security and for all that he has dons to make the United Stations a stronger and more credible Organisation because it is able to defend the rights, the independence and the sovereignty of its Members.\nWe also welcome - and draw attention to the importance of the growing universality of our Organisation - the presence of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia in the Assembly. Their presence represents an outstanding example of our universality. We are indeed glad to see our family circle growing.\nWithout question the world is entering a new era. The improvement in the international situation following the disappearance of East-West antagonisms appears to have strengthened the resolve of the international community to promote dialogue and compromise in order to achieve lasting peace and reinforced its commitment in favour of human rights. The end of the cold war should enable us to respond better to the aspirations of the peoples for freedom and democracy, to speed up the process of general and complete disarmament and to seek definitive solutions to regional conflicts which persist and to the major economic and social problems of the world.\nThe aspirations for freedom and democracy which have supported the upheavals in the Eastern European countries over the last two years have now become widely shared in the world and are the foundation for the better management of national affairs.\nThe recent spurts of political, economic and social renewal in many African countries nave offered us tangible proof of the political maturity of our peoples and have clearly disproved the argument that democracy is the preserve of the developed countries and only a luxury for the developing countries. Of course, the transfer from an autocracy that has lasted for many years to democratic management of the State cannot be carried out without difficulty. But the Togolese people, anxious to promote a state of law and using its own resources through their National Sovereign Conference, have now committed themselves to an overall process of democratisation which calls for one and all to be involved in order to ensure the primacy of freedom and justice in the management of our affairs.\nThere is an old saying that \\\"the voice of the people is the voice of Gad\\\". Time moves on inexorably and the march of our peoples towards democracy is irreversible and their commitment to that path is total. The people of Togo thirst for true democracy and any political option must necessarily take account of the social realities and the deep-seated aspirations of our people if it is to succeed.\nThe people of Togo recognise the virtues of democracy but they believe that there can be no true democracy unless there is dialogue between the peoples and the leaders, between the base and the summit. They also believe that there can be no prosperity without liberalisation of the creative forces of the nation and that there cannot be true democracy unless there is social and economic development based on solidarity that helps everyone.\nAll of the important resolutions that emerge from our National Conference, however lofty they may be, will be doomed to failure unless the Government has the resources with which to implement them. That is why the people of Togo, through its Government of transition, calls for the support of brotherly and friendly countries and of the international community, as well as of countries devoted to peace, justice and fairness. He would urge all of these to follow a policy of cooperation, assistance and solidarity with respect to Togo, in order to help us to establish our youthful democracy on a solid basis of freedom and peace.\nThe aspirations of peoples for freedom and democracy cannot be realised unless the world is free from the threat of the build up of weapons of mass destruction and regional conflicts which pose a threat to international peace and security. That is why I am happy to recall that the United Nations Charter has established as its goal the maintenance of international peace and security, the development of international relations and the implementation of cooperation among States. Thus, the sessions of the General Assembly offer us every year an opportunity to see to what extent our conduct is in harmony with the ideals to which we subscribe.\nIndeed, the world is undeniably on the threshold of a new era. The improved international situation, following the world's geopolitical transformation, seems to have strengthened the international community's resolve to consolidate and reinforce its achievements towards lasting peace and the promotion of human rights. This strengthening also requires a search for definitive solutions to conflicts that seem to be dragging on forever and which could jeopardise the progress achieved. The efforts to settle some of these conflicts - in Cambodia, Western Sahara, Mozambique and Angola - are grounds for hope.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, the Government of Togo hopes that a swift, equitable and definitive solution can be found in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Organisation of African Unity and the recommendations of the United Nations. My country, which fully supports respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, quite rightly welcomes the commendable United Nations efforts that led to the recent establishment of a cease-fire in the Western Sahara. We hope that this cease-fire will be fully respected by all parties to the conflict. We invite them to do everything possible to facilitate the organization of the long-awaited referendum under the auspices of the United Nations, without delay and in conditions acceptable to all. Togo is proud that it has been chosen to send peace-keeping troops to help organize the referendum on the question of self-determination.\nThe Government of Togo also welcomes the solutions found to the crises that have brought such sorrow to Angola and Mozambique since they achieved independence. We hope that the parties to these disputes will respect the agreements that have been signed and seize this historic opportunity to set out on the path towards national reconciliation.\nOn the question of Liberia, the Government of Togo would hope that concord, harmony and national reconciliation can finally be restored in that brotherly country. Despite some progress, much remains to be done to strengthen peace. But we remain optimistic. The movement towards a final settlement of this fratricidal conflict has been strengthened following the meetings in Lome, Bamako and Yamoussokro. Our country will pursue its work along those lines, hoping to see the parties arrive at solutions that will guarantee to the people of Liberia peace, reconciliation and national reconstruction following free and democratic elections.\nTogo welcomes the recent positive developments in the dispute between Mauritania and Senegal. As in the past, my country is willing to continue efforts, together with the States of our subregion, towards a lasting and equitable solution to this distressing dispute between two brotherly countries.\nOn the question of South Africa, everything seems to suggest that we are at the dawn of a new era of hope, but apartheid is still alive. Of course, some positive initiatives have been taken by the South African authorities, such as the repeal of the Land Acts and the laws on separate housing. Nevertheless, there remain many obstacles on the path to salvation that the Pretoria authorities must overcome at any cost if there is to be a democratic system and the establishment of a state of law in South Africa before the sanctions are removed in their entirety.\nThe Middle East remains the most insecure part of the world despite the end of the Gulf war. That is why my Government is following with interest the negotiations now under way with a view to convening a conference bringing together all parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization. We\nappreciate the efforts made, inter alia, by the United States of America, to ensure lasting peace in that part of the world.\nOn the Arab/Persian Gulf, my Governments invites Iraq and Kuwait to abide by the relevant Security Council resolutions, to respect all parts of those resolutions, and to create favourable conditions for the normalisation of intergovernmental relations in the region.\nAs to Lebanon, for many years the theatre of political and inter-communal strife, we are glad to see civil peace and national harmony restored in that country, which has suffered so much from so many years of war. We deeply hope that that State will finally be liberated of all foreign occupation.\nThe Cambodian question continues to hold our attention. Togo, a peace- and freedom-loving country, welcomed the convening, from 24 to 26 June 1991 in Pattaya, of a meeting that led to the unanimous election of His Royal Highness Prince Samdech Horodom Sihanouk as Chairman of the Supreme National Council. That election, inspired by a spirit of national compromise and reconciliation, certainly provides a stimulus to the peace and reunification process under way. Recent agreements between the parties to that conflict, as well as the United Nations peace proposals, should, we hope, restore peace to that friendly country.\nOn the question of Afghanistan, it is indeed deplorable that, following the departure of foreign troops from the country, the situation has not yet improved in any tangible way. He invite the various parties, in all freedom and without outside interference, to commit themselves to talks aimed at a peaceful, negotiated solution to the problem of Afghanistan with a view to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nIn Central America, Togo supports and commends the many efforts of the\nUnited Nations towards the restoration and strengthening of peace. We urge the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts and to take any action necessary for a definitive solution to the crises in El Salvador and Guatemala.\nAs to Europe, and more particularly Yugoslavia, a non-aligned State, my country regrets the intransigence of the parties to that conflict, which threatens to become an international one if common sense does not win out over narrow egoism and nationalism. We do appreciate all of the efforts made by the international community and by the Europe of the Twelve with a view to putting an end to the atrocities. These are internal affairs, it will be claimed, but faced with the scope of the crisis we would invite the hostile brothers of Yugoslavia to lay down their arms immediately and unconditionally with a view to a negotiated political solution.\nThe Togolese delegation welcomes the continuation and indeed strengthening of the disarmament movement, which has been consolidated and enriched in the last five years by the signing of many agreements on arms reduction - for example, the agreement on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe in 1990 and, more recently, in July 1991, the signing in Moscow of the START agreement on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons, following intensive bilateral negotiations between the two super-Powers. Here we would also welcome and commend the most recent specific proposals for the destruction and reduction of offensive weapons made by United States President George Bush, which will certainly accelerate the disarmament process at the international level. For Togo, general and complete disarmament is an imperative. In that regard, the other countries involved must also commit themselves to the progressive reduction of armed forces and traditional conventional weapons, which are as lethal as they are devastating, with a view\nto the conclusion of many other international instruments towards that end. What is at stake is the peace, security and happiness of the human race as a whole. On the threshold of the third millennium, we are happy to see the end of the cold war. Compromise, dialogue and cooperation seen to be gaining ground over confrontation. The current state of relations between the nations of the world augurs a world of tomorrow that will be more stable, with political systems in which freedom and human dignity will be respected. \nHowever, while numerous recent events prompt optimism, others are indeed sources of concern and distress. For world stability is not based exclusively on an improvement in international political relations. It is also, and indeed primarily, based on establishing conditions that could generate and equitably distribute economic prosperity in the world. The end of the cold war, or rather, the shift from distrust and confrontation between East and West towards dialogue, compromise and partnership, should encourage the progressive elimination of those many disparities in international economic cooperation and a resumption of the North-South dialogue.\nIn order to be effective and lasting, political detente must also involve economic detente. This means that the disappearance of political and ideological antagonisms and economic rapprochement between the countries of East and West must not be to the detriment of the developing world. This also assumes a reorientation of international economic relations towards a genuine commonality of interests that could lead to progressive and total integration of the Eastern countries and of the developing countries into the world economy.\nAs for the lessons to be learned or, rather, the disappointments and failures of the 1980s, a period generally considered a decade that was lost to development for the poor countries, the following challenges should urgently be taken up:\nFirst, we must break the vicious circle of the massive and growing external indebtedness of the poor countries and of the continuing deterioration in the terms of trade by instituting vigorous measures to ensure short-term economic recovery and long-term growth; \nSecondly, protectionist tendencies must be reversed by creating an open and equitable trading system within the contest of multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Sound);\nThirdly, efforts towards diversification and modernization of the least developed countries should be supported, and the financial flows to those countries should be substantially increased.\nIt is also important scrupulously to ensure the implementation of decisions on the revitalization of the Economic and Social Council in close cooperation with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. In any case, the new breath of life brought to international economic cooperation must be based on the strict implementation of recommendations adopted by the international community following international economic meetings. They includes the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation adopted at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly; the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade; the Plan of Action of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries; and the Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children.\nThe developing countries are fully aware of their paramount responsibility for their economic and social development. Indicative of this awareness are the initiatives at various levels to promote and strengthen South-South cooperation and to make it complement North-South cooperation. To this end we concluded the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community at the Summit Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Abuja, Nigeria, from 3 to 6 June 1991, which is in keeping with the Lagos Plan of Action providing for the economic, social and cultural integration of Africa.\nIt is also within the context of strengthening South-South cooperation that we should look at the wise and realistic recommendations in the report of the South Commission, submitted to the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva last July. Those recommendations emphasize the paramount responsibility of the South for its own development and stress the human dimension of development and the urgent need for the poorer countries to strengthen their collective autonomy and their unity of action. The positive assessment by many developed countries and multilateral institutions of the report of the South Commission must be accompanied by specific commitments to encourage implementation of the recommendations in that report.\nWe must also draw attention to the disturbing situation of African debt and the fragility of our economies. The overall African debt is large and will continue to grow. It could exceed $550 billion by the year 2000 despite efforts by African countries for economic recovery. Some creditor countries have shown a certain awareness of this increasingly disturbing state of affairs. Measures have been taken to reduce the debt of the developing countries. We welcome the efforts made by some rich countries towards easing the debt burden, and hope that much will be done to help the third world in this regard. However, the debt forgiveness agreed by the industrialized countries is still inadequate to rescue the poor countries from this serious crisis.\nThe international community must also deal with the crucial issue of rapid environmental degradation. These changes will have serious economic and social consequences for present and future generations. Special consideration should thus be given to air and water pollution, the ozone layer, soil depletion and desertification. International cooperation for environmental protection requires a global approach, taking account of all aspects of the question, without ignoring the development priorities of the developing countries. In this regard, the developing countries should participate actively in the work of the preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Effective international measures must be taken to prevent the dumping of toxic wastes in the territories of other countries.\nThe challenges facing us to make our world a safer, more peaceful and more prosperous one are many and complex, but I think members will agree that the world has made progress in its search for solutions. For this progress to be lasting and irreversible, it is essential to strengthen our faith in the Organisation and its principles. Nothing lasting has ever been achieved and nothing lasting can be built in conditions of insecurity, disorder and chaos.\nInternational peace and security can be achieved, not through distrust, but rather through dialogue and understanding between peoples, which generate equitably shared prosperity. It is only then that we will be able to dream of a world where our only concern will be to cherish peace and safeguard moral values based on respect for human dignity and to share the joy of general prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Community and its Member States. First allow me to extend to you, Sir, my cordial congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. With your wisdom and experience, I am sure this Assembly will be in good hands.\nWe salute the admission to the United Nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, former Members of the League of Nations. I should also like to extend a warm welcome to South Korea and North Korea. May their admission signal a further improvement in their mutual relations for the benefit of the Korean people. Having listened to the impressive statement by the President of the Republic of Korea, we really feel that augurs well for the future of inter-Korean relations. We also cordially welcome the Marshall Islands and Micronesia to the United Nations family.\nWe live in spectacular times in which the United Nations has a crucial role to play. The European Community and its Member States have taken joint positions and actions on many of the problems facing us today. These positions can be found fully detailed in a memorandum which forms an integral part of my statement and is now being circulated in this room. This allows me to concentrate on a smaller number of issues.\nThe failure of the coup d'etat last month in the Soviet Union confirms that a new era in international political life has begun. The democratic revolution which had swept through central and eastern Europe in the last two years has now also taken hold in the heartland of communism. The ground had been prepared by the perestroika and glasnost policies of President Gorbachev. But when reactionary forces tried to restore a dying and unjust order they met with brave and insurmountable resistance by numerous Soviet citizens and their principled elected leaders. In the end, democracy von, both in form and in spirit. This victory now has to be consolidated and made safe by truly democratising State structures and greater devolution of power in Soviet society.\nIn the wake of these developments international relations increasingly become characterised by common values and common responsibilities. Representative government breeds responsible domestic government and responsible international behaviour. Democratic government implies government that is accountable, not just to a country's own citizens, but also to its fallow nations. Here we touch upon the heart of the United Nations Charter.\nIraq is a case which proves my point, albeit by contrast. Its acts of aggression abroad reflect the lack of legitimacy of its government at home. The way in which the Iraqi regime has been carelessly sacrificing the lives of its citizens in external military adventures finds a mirror image in its brutal clamp-down on the thirst for freedom among its own people. Repressive government breeds irresponsible government. The United Nations rightly maintains its strong pressure on the Government of Iraq to revise its reckless policies. At the same time the international community has demonstrated, with Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991), its willingness to take the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people into account. Non-compliance would only directly hurt the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi Government would be held fully responsible for this.\nDemocracy and respect for fundamental freedoms being on the rise, not only in Eastern Europe but also elsewhere on the globe, the world is experiencing new possibilities for international cooperation, regional integration and a more just and lawful world order. In order to meet these challenges, strengthening and reforming the United Nations are among the tasks which press themselves upon us. However, in these hopeful and promising times not all is well. Several regions and countries, including notably the newly emerging democracies, are grappling with serious instabilities and even conflicts. We sincerely hope that the emancipation of the republics and the awakening of national feelings in the Soviet Union will strengthen rather than weaken that country's peaceful process of democratic change.\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the world, although some conflicts appear to be on the way towards satisfactory resolution, others are still festering or are even only just beginning to surface. Painful as they may be for those directly involved, and dangerous as they may be for regional security, these conflicts also tend to place a heavy burden upon the world as a whole. The number of people seeking refuge in other countries, for instance, is rapidly increasing. This problem can only become more serious if, in conjunction with these conflicts, economic conditions continue to deteriorate. Willingly or unwillingly, the world is increasingly affected. In an ever more interdependent, and yet at the same time fragmenting, world, we need to shoulder our common responsibilities.\nLet aw turn first to Europe. In this old continent we hope to have learned some lessons from our long history of bloody conflicts and nationalistic strife.\nIn the European Community we intend to take decisive steps this year towards further economic and political unification. Apart from direct economic benefits which the Community member States should be able to reap the deeper motive is clearly political. We have taken to heart what Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Community, taught us: that \nwe should not fight over national borders, but, rather, make them irrelevant through ever-increasing economic and political cooperation so as to be able to remove them altogether in the end. This political inspiration is a strong guarantee that the European Community will not turn inward. Instead, both in the economic and the political field we are determined to remain open-minded, ready to play a responsible role, both in Europe and in the world as a whole. Our recent initiatives on Yugoslavia are a reflection of this attitude. Since 7 September a Conference on Yugoslavia, with, in its context, an Arbitration Commission, has been under way in The Hague under the aegis of the European Community. A cease-fire agreement is being monitored by European Community countries together with four other States participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\n\tThe European Community and its member States will persevere in their mediation efforts. Their aim in doing so is not to preserve artificially a unity that no longer exists nor to impose a destiny upon the peoples of Yugoslavia, which only they have the right to decide upon. Bather, the Twelve hope to help avoid an uncontrolled and violent fragmentation resulting from bitterness and hatred and from extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism, which in the past has brought so much shame, bloodshed and suffering to our continent and to the world as a whole.\nWhere in Yugoslavia new political structures are called for, let them be negotiated and decided upon through peaceful dialogue. Let these talks be conducted with full respect both for the right to self-determination but also for legitimate concerns for the full protection of minority rights, which is a prime duty of any responsible government. The Twelve will not recognise any change of borders established by force and call upon the world community to adopt a similar position. The Twelve will continue to insist on full compliance with the principles of the Helsinki final Act and the Charter of Paris for a new Europe.\nOur endeavours to find appropriate answers to this crisis could be significantly reinforced by endorsement from the Security Council and the international community as a whole, the more so since we feel that a continuation of this crisis poses a threat to international peace and security.\nThe Community and its member States have instituted an arms embargo against Yugoslavia until self-defence and protection of minorities no longer serve as an excuse for expansionism and oppression. Given the continuous breaches of the cease-fire agreements, the Twelve are of the opinion that a mandatory arms embargo by the Security Council under Chapter VII is needed to bring the violence to an end in this region. More generally speaking, we feel that the authoritative voice of the Security Council, expressing full support for the regional endeavours being undertaken, would certainly contribute to their positive outcome.\nWe are convinced that the peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav question will have a positive bearing on potential conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. We therefore call upon all leaders, parties and all people in Yugoslavia to stop the violence and to cooperate with us in order to make the Yugoslavia Conference, under European Community auspices and under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington, a success for the sake of all in Yugoslavia and for peace and stability on our continent.\nIn the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) the 38 European and North American member States have developed norms of State behaviour which, while based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, clearly go beyond them in scope and commitment. The Charter of Paris, concluded at the CSCE summit meeting of November 1990, spells out the new democratic consensus in Europe, taking human rights as the key to the organization of both political and socio-economic life. Recent events in the Soviet Union show that these are not just solemn words on a piece of paper but a living reality for a growing number of people. Also, the European Community and its member States acted upon the Paris Charter when they condemned the Soviet putsch as illegitimate and came down on the side of the democratic opposition. Strengthening CSCE, in not only its normative aspects but also its mechanism for crisis management, is high on the agenda of the Twelve. In this way we hope to serve regional security and well-being, complementary to our obligations under the United Nations Charter.\nCommon responsibility in today's world requires more than improving upon old structures, institutions and habits. Necessary as that may be, it would be insufficient if we did not also try to develop new ways of thinking. Allow me to share a few thoughts with you in this respect.\nWe need more responsible behaviour between States. Its first rule is the ban on the threat or use of force, as contained in Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. This is certainly no superfluous rule. Breaches of it can leave no State indifferent, as was fortunately exemplified by the international community's response to the Gulf crisis. Yet, both national and international security require more than just refraining from aggression. Security is enhanced by the breaking down of barriers of distrust, by the promotion of trade, contacts and communication, by the free flow of people, values and ideas - in brief, by opening up our societies. Security is further enhanced by taking the concerns of others to heart.\nIn the military field we have to show responsibility by engaging in processes of arms control, arms reduction and confidence-building. Regional arrangements must be supplemented by world-wide agreements, as is shown by the pressing need for a convention on banning chemical weapons, for which the year 1992 really is the deadline. Squally importantly, existing treaties such as the 1972 Convention on biological and toxic weapons must be store effectively implemented. The Review Conference convening at present should lay a solid foundation for this. \nEvents in the Gulf region have once again made it unmistakably clear that more responsibility is needed in arms transfers. The European Council has identified common criteria on which national policies on arms exports are based. In the perspective of political union, we hope for a further harmonization of our national policies. As action on a more global scale is needed, we shall - together with others, including Japan - submit a draft resolution in this Assembly seeking the international registration of arms transfers, with a view to promoting restraint by increasing transparency.\nAs for the important question of nuclear disarmament, we welcome the recent conclusion of the START agreement on long-range strategic nuclear arms between the United States and the Soviet Union. It sets the stage for even further reductions in the field of nuclear weapons. The universality of the norm of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the effectiveness of its regime have been reconfirmed by the announced accessions to it of such key countries as France and China. We also welcome South Africa as a new party. We note with satisfaction that the Soviet Union has given assurances that it will institute safeguards against nuclear proliferation while restructuring the relations between its central Government and the Union republics. In order to solve an increasing number of global problems or even threats to mankind we have to assume greater responsibility, notably in the fields of development and environment.\nLack of economic development, leading to staggering poverty, is not just a curse for the hundreds of millions of people who suffer from it. It is a moral shame, it constitutes a burden on the whole world's development and it is a potential threat to global stability. The situation of many African countries is particularly worrying. The new United Nations agenda for Africa rightly focuses on debt relief, resource flows and better market access. At the same time, it makes it clear that African Governments should fulfil their side of the development contract by improving their own performance, liberalising their economies, allowing for popular participation and political pluralism and giving due attention to all other aspects of good governance.\nDeveloping countries, including the poorest, need trade as well as aid. This is not the least important reason why the Uruguay Round of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) must not fail. We must open the world for expanding exchanges of goods and services and resist the protectionist temptation. This is without any doubt not always easy, but with reasonable compromises from all sides we shall be able to succeed. The European Community will certainly do its bit. Its discussion about the reform of its common agricultural policy gives a clear indication of this.\nEconomic growth which fails to take into account the ecological balance becomes self-defeating. Development must be sustainable. Environmental concerns should be fully integrated into the economic process. Next year's United Nations Conference on Environment and Development presents a unique opportunity to make concrete progress in this field, both in tackling environmental problems which impede development and in addressing global environmental issues such as climate change and biological diversity. Much work remains to be done in the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development if a meaningful bargain is to be struck in Rio de Janeiro. With only one session remaining, there are many seemingly insurmountable obstacles, especially relating to additional funding and technology transfer. In order to maintain momentum and commitment, we need to give this process further impetus at the political level. In our joint statement to the Second Committee we will go more deeply into this matter.\nCalamities in various parts of the world, both natural and man-made, continue to confront us with loss of lives, devastation and uprooting. While the international community makes some effort to help, it can certainly do better. In order to ensure proper coordination between United Nations institutions, donor and recipient countries and non-governmental organizations we need to strengthen the emergency response capacity of the United Nations. To this end the Community and its member States wish to cooperate with others in launching an initiative during this session of the Assembly calling among other things for the appointment of a high-level United Nations coordinator, the creation of an inter-agency coordination mechanism and the establishment of an emergency fund. In this context we look forward to the report of the Secretary-General on this matter.\nAnother area which requires greatly enhanced responsibility concerns relations within States, particularly respect for human rights. Despite progress, flagrant violations persist in many countries, thereby not just endangering precious human dignity in itself, but also undermining chances for development and for internal and external peace. The days when countries could credibly claim that their human rights record was a strictly internal affair are definitely over. The history of the United Nations has confirmed the legitimacy of the contrary view.\nThe United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, to be held in Berlin in 1993, could greatly enhance international respect for human rights by notably concentrating on improving the implementation of existing norms and standards and on extending the scope of mechanisms for reviewing compliance. We believe, for instance, that the Special Rapporteur constitutes a supervisory mechanism which deserves application on a much wider scale. Meanwhile, the United Nations would also become a more credible human rights propagator itself if it allocated more of its existing financial resources to that goal. The Twelve stress the need for changing budgetary priorities in order to alleviate the financial and staffing difficulties in which the United Nations Centre for Human Rights finds itself.\nGiven the close relationship between human rights and democracy the Community and its member States are also very much in favour of the United Nations exploring ways to promote democratic processes around the world. This could range from the monitoring of free elections to assistance in building democratic institutions. Another field in which the United Nations could play an important role concerns the protection of minority rights. At a time when existing States are coming under pressure from demands for autonomy and self-determination from segments of their populations, which thereby challenge the principle of territorial integrity from within, creative and innovative thinking is clearly in demand. In order to prevent unilateralism and even the use of force from prevailing, the world needs to develop principles and mechanisms for the promotion of negotiated and peaceful solutions to these issues which are satisfactory to all concerned. We think the United Nations should intensify this discussion.\nNaturally, human rights are primarily the responsibility of national governments. But the world cannot sit idly by when one of the Member States of the United Nations terrorises its own people. History shows that such acts, apart from being criminal, can endanger international peace and security if nothing is done about them. Recently we have witnessed intervention by our world Organisation for the sake of protecting human rights. In the aftermath of the liberation of Kuwait a number of countries belonging to the international coalition provided a safe haven to Iraqi Kurds fleeing from repression and attempts at genocide by their own Government. This action, which implemented the relevant Security Council resolutions, has meanwhile been followed up by the stationing of a corps of United Nations civil guards, this time with the consent of the Government concerned. In a regional context we have also seen the peace-keeping operation by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) during the bloody civil war in Liberia.\nThese interventions may not have been perfect - they could not prevent all loss of innocent life - but they were certainly salutary considering the human suffering they were able to stop. It is to be hoped that in the future these developments will have a discouraging effect on Governments in comparable situations; and if we want the world to become a safer place, we will need more than a ban on aggression. International law and order should be founded equally on democracy and on respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. Above all, this is clearly a major challenge for the United Nations.\nA common responsibility from which none of us can hide concerns the functioning of the United Nations. In recent years the world political climate has clearly improved for the United Nations, particularly in relation to its core function! the maintenance of international peace and security. Increasingly, the United Nations has risen to the occasion and played a crucial role in helping to resolve burning issues. We should capitalise on this fortunate development and try to strengthen the political functions of the United Nations.\nOne of the opportunities resulting from the increased political efficacy of the Security Council and its ability to act in concert lies in the area of preventive diplomacy. We should not just wait until conflicts get out of hand and become actual threats to international peace and security. Why could the Security Council not formulate political statements aimed at defusing tensions in a particular situation at an early stage, rather as the Twelve have increasingly done in the context of our European political cooperation? Why should it not also dispatch fact-finding missions to troubled areas? In fact, the whole concept of peace-keeping - which has evolved rapidly in recent years - could be given another boost by exploring the possibilities in this direction, too. In this way United Nations Involvement could help prevent conflicts frost actually breaking out or contain them at an early stage.\nSimilarly, the increased political relevance of the Security Council also points to new opportunities for the Secretary-General to make fuller use of his competence under Article 99 of the Charter. The Secretary-General could benefit from the changes in the international climate by initiating at an early stage discussions within the Security Council on matters which, in his opinion, threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. In this way the Security Council could further improve its decision-making ability.\nStrengthening the political functions of the United Nations should, however, go hand in hand with a continued and resolute restructuring of the United Nations system in all its aspects. This is rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General in its latest report on the Organisation. The Economic and Social Council should be revitalised: the resumed forty-fifth session produced encouraging signs of progress in this direction. Also, the General Assembly needs to seriously rethink its own procedures and methods, in order to make itself more able to provide guidance to the international community.\nLast but certainly not least, reform of the Secretariat seems essential if the United Nations is to acquire the capacity and flexibility to cope with present and future tasks. The incoming Secretary-General should be in a position to act upon broad outlines for increased operational efficiency that are widely supported in this Assembly.\nFor the United Nations to be effective, restructuring will, however, not be enough. A sound financial base is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, not all Member States fulfil their financial obligations. We therefore urge all Members to live up to their responsibility and pay their assessed contributions on time.\nIn a number of regional conflicts we can discern certain rays of hope. Bringing about peace in the Middle East is now an urgent task. In particular this is true of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question. The Twelve have from the outset supported the initiative of the United States to set in motion a process of parallel negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours and between Israel and the Palestinians. We welcome the untiring efforts of Secretary of State Baker and we urge all parties not to miss this historic opportunity to have a peace conference convened for next month. The European Community and its Member States will actively contribute to the success of this conference.\nAs to their substance, these negotiations will have to be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and their implied principle of \\\"land for peace\\\". Israel must be able to enjoy its right to live within secure and recognised borders. Equally, the Palestinians' right to self-determination must be given proper expression. The international community should do its utmost to encourage all parties concerned to negotiate in good faith and make compromises in order to bring a just, lasting and comprehensive peace to this tormented region. The negotiations would be greatly facilitated by regional security arrangements and confidence-building measures by the countries in the region. In this context, the Twelve would welcome the repeal of the resolution equating Zionism with racism, which was referred to yesterday by President Bush in his statement to the Assembly.\nSouth Africa is an area of conflict which gives reason for some optimism. The reform process led by President De Klerk has undeniably moved the country into a qualitatively new phase. The legal foundations of apartheid have been removed, notably by the repeal of the Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act and the Land Acts. That is, however, not enough to create A united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. It is indispensable that negotiations begin soon on a new constitutional order with the broadest possible participation from all segments of South African society. All parties, and not least the South African Government, have to help to create a climate conducive to the success of such negotiations. The international community, which is committed to the complete dismantling of apartheid, should monitor these developments in an appropriate manner. In order to encourage constructive change it should be willing to gradually revoke restrictive measures vis-\u00e0-vis South Africa to the degree that reforms have been put into effect.\nAs to Cambodia, the past year has brought substantial progress towards the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement. We welcome the delegation of the Cambodian Supreme National Council, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk. We rejoice in the newly established cooperation between the Cambodian parties and call upon them to conclude without delay the peace process at the next resumed session of the Cambodian Conference on the basis of the plan of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The Twelve stress the importance of free elections as the centrepiece of that plan, which was unanimously approved by the Security Council and the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I also reaffirm our willingness to contribute to the reconstruction and development of Cambodia upon the achievement of a political settlement.\nLet me conclude by expressing our heartfelt appreciation to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to further the cause of international peace and justice. With the end of his period of tenure in this high office in sight, it must be gratifying for him to see some formerly intractable conflicts edging towards resolution. Many could be mentioned Cyprus, El Salvador, the Western Sahara and others. On behalf of the Twelve of the European Community, I pay tribute to Javier Peres de Cueliar, whose high moral stature, diplomatic skills and political leadership have guided the Organisation through 10 difficult years. We also owe it to him that the United Nations has come to play a crucial role on the world scene, as the founding fathers foresaw when the Organisation was conceived 6 years ago. We wish him well and we salute him as an eminent partisan of peace.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am sure we will all benefit from your long experience here in the United Nations, and from your authority as President that derives from that experience. Australia enjoys strong bonds of friendship with Saudi Arabia and is honoured to serve with you as one of your Vice-Presidents for this session.\nAustralia warmly welcomes to membership of this body our Pacific island neighbours, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Equally, as a country of the Asia-Pacific region, we welcome the arrival at last of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. And Australia having been among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, we are delighted now to welcome those countries too to United Nations membership.\nMr. President, you are presiding over the General Assembly at a time when the United Nations is at last attaining the coherence and momentum necessary to meet the goals of its founders. The United Nations has sometimes been perceived as an autonomous entity - good or bad, progressive or retrograde, vibrant or moribund, according to the eye of the beholder. In fact, it can do no more than reflect the wishes of its Members and the relationships between them. Its success depends on the membership's capacity for compromise rather than confrontation, for generosity rather than greed, for humanitarianism rather than hostility - and for a measure of idealism.\nThroughout the United Nations system a quite dramatic change of atmosphere has been evident since 1989, most markedly, though not exclusively, in security matters following the collapse of the cold war. Both the forty-fourth and the forty-fifth sessions of the General Assembly have been widely remarked as having been among the most harmonious and cooperative on record, with major progress on issues such as the environment, human rights and even the reform and rationalization of the United Nations administrative system itself. The old and all-too-familiar voting blocs acted less cohesively, and with more regard to consensus.\nThese atmospheric developments are partly attributable, of course, to flow-on effects from the end of the cold war, but they appear to owe rather more to an emerging world-wide recognition that a great many problems can really only be dealt with effectively by cooperation on a multilateral, and in some cases global, scale. To the familiar and established topics in this category, such as refugees, famine, debt and the control of nuclear weapons, have now been added issues such as major environmental problems, AIDS and narcotics. In an increasingly complex world the United Nations is itself becoming an increasingly complex place.\nThose are all issues which this session, under your guidance, Mr. President, will need to address. They are also issues which will confront the new Secretary-General, whose appointment will be perhaps the most important decision to be taken at this session. This is not to suggest that the Secretary-General is more important than the Organization, but it is a recognition of the vital task the new Secretary-General will fulfil as the United Nations approaches its fiftieth anniversary. Much has already been said about the qualities which the new Secretary-General will need to take up the tasks that the United Nations is now able to, and must, address. Foremost amongst them must be integrity, an independence of mind and a willingness and desire to serve the United Nations in the interest of the Organisation as a whole. The Secretary-General must be a skilled and patient negotiator, with an intuition for the right moment to intervene and with the patience and stamina to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. He or she must provide intellectual leadership in the crafting of imaginative approaches to the multiplicity of problems, old and new, requiring resolution through the United Nations.\nOf course, the Secretary-General cannot develop these ideas working alone; in this, as well as in other responsibilities, he or she must have the managerial capacity to harness fully all the resources and talents of those working in the Secretariat. Finally, in an age of mass communications, and with the spread of democracy, he or she must be able effectively to transmit the principles and purposes of the Organisation to a wider public which will provide it with its necessary base of support.\nThe agenda the Secretary-General faces can be summarized under four broad headings: political and security issues; development issues; humanitarian issues; and United Nations reform. That is a daunting collection on which I will offer some thoughts, though certainly not prescriptions. But before so doing I should place on record Australia's admiration for the determination and wisdom demonstrated by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar over the past decade. He has served the world well through his personal involvement in a number of international issues, including Cyprus, Afghanistan, the Middle East and Iraq-Iran, and through his overall management of the United Nations in times of crisis such as during the recent Gulf war. He has shepherded the United Nations from confrontation to great-Power cooperation. Moreover in the past decade the financial situation of the United Nations has improved and there has been an increased preparedness to look to the need for administrative reform. He can look forward to the completion of his two terms with a sense of very considerable achievement.\nWhen the history of the first 50 years of the United Nations is written I am certain that particular prominence will be given to Mr. Peres de Cuellar's outstanding contribution to the resolution of regional conflicts. Those in Cambodia and Namibia are but two examples, where my country has had a particular role and interest. The new Secretary-General will need to maintain this momentum and build on the pattern of cooperation which has been achieved between the major Powers.\nUnited Nations representatives have played an outstanding role on Cambodia, and Australia regards with particular satisfaction the results of the meetings of the Cambodian Supreme National Council and the five Permanent members of the Security Council in Thailand in August and here in New York in the past few days. The Permanent Five, regional countries including the co-Chairman of the Paris Conference, Indonesia, under the very able guidance of its Foreign Minister Mr. Ali Alatas, and Australia, and the Cambodian parties themselves have all striven long and hard to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Cambodian dispute. All the signs are now that no obstacles remain to signature of a comprehensive settlement in Paris next month. But clearly, once a settlement is thus achieved, the peace will have to be consolidated, and that will be no easy task.\nThe United Nations will have before it one of its moat complex and costly decisions when the Security Council and then the General Assembly debate plans for the United Nations transitional authority in Cambodia. The authority's assignment will be daunting, but it is a mark of the very great distance we, as United Nations Members, have travelled in the last two years that such an undertaking will soon be a reality. I reaffirm hare Australia's willingness to make a substantial contribution to the authority and to continue to play our role as a facilitator of a lasting peace in Cambodia.\nIn the Middle East, there is now a batter prospect than in recent years for significant progress on Arab-Israeli issues as the international conference proposed for October approaches. What part the United Nations will play in the continued search for a resolution of the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli dispute will be, of course, a matter for the parties themselves to decide. It is clear though that the United Nations, and the new Secretary-General in particular, has the potential to play a constructive and valuable role.\nWe are also hopeful that the Secretary-General's continued efforts to achieve a settlement of the Cyprus question will bear fruit, the more so because of the personal effort the Secretary-General has invested in this task, and we would urge the parties to proceed with the proposed conference.\nBut just as we witness progress in those areas of tension on issues which have been on the United Nations agenda for some time, so new issues confront the international community. The violence now erupting in Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia is a stark reminder of the enormous difficulties which can result from social and ethnic tensions. We are all acutely conscious of how newly emergent nationalism within the borders of many existing countries around the world is creating a new set of strains end dilemmas in the conduct of international relations.\nThe most immediate area of concern for the international community is the situation in Yugoslavia. Australia, not least because more than 250,000 of our people have strong links of family and culture with Yugoslavia, has voiced its grave concern at the breakdown of constitutional order, the tragic loss of life and the impending threat of all-out war in that country.\nThe conflict in Yugoslavia has certainly reached the point where the international community needs to reinforce the efforts of the European Community to resolve the crisis. Australia has accordingly asked the Security Council to take up the issue and use its influence to help bring about an end of the fighting. There are important issues to be resolved about the future shape of Yugoslavia's republics, and in particular about the position of minorities within those republics. These are issues that must be seriously addressed and resolved by negotiation once the fighting has stopped, but there can be no justification for resorting to force to settle them. Unfortunately there can be no doubt that the conflict within Yugoslavia has now created a situation which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security in the region, and one which demands the attention of the United Nations.\nWith its new and constructive role of the United Nations come certain responsibilities and the need to recognize that changes in the international environment demand changes in this Assembly's approach to regional developments. For too long, debate and resolutions on a number of regional issues have been characterised here by outdated rhetoric. Let me make a plea to the Assembly that we might be able to consider changes to language which no longer reflects the new realities of the 1990s. For example, Australia hopes that debate on such traditional issues as the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, decolonisation and South Africa will be conducted in a fashion that acknowledges the opportunities for progress and, at least in South Africa's case, the progress already achieved. Similarly, Australia hopes that it may be possible to rescind resolution 3379 (XXX) of 1975 equating Zionism with racism.\nNo one can be complacent over the difficulties still ahead in the resolution of regional conflict. We do, however, share a genuine global sense of optimism about the future role of the United Nations in peace and security matters. There are four distinct areas of United Nations activity in this regard: peace enforcement; peace-keeping; peacemaking or preventive diplomacy; and arms control and disarmament.\nThe Gulf war was a classic case of peace enforcement by collective security measures. The founders of the United Nations recognised that it would have to have available to it as a final resort the use of force to resist aggression. But willingness to undertake enforcement action, by itself, does not constitute a system of collective security. Its actual use on this occasion will have a deterrent effect for the future, but the establishment of a true system of collective security also demands progress on multilateral disarmament, the development of confidence-building measures in various regions of the world and commitment to the removal, on a consistent and even-handed basis, of the root causes of conflict.\nIn fact, situations like Namibia and Cambodia involving peace-keeping forces are more likely than the Gulf situation to set the pattern of future United Nations action, that is, a form of peace-making activity which falls somewhere between good offices at one end of the spectrum and enforcement action on the other. The final settlement of a dispute will be through negotiation, but often with a peace-keeping component. Although peace-keeping operations were not originally envisaged in the Charter, they fit precisely the sort of circumstances which are likely to occur more often in the post-cold-war era.\nThe Secretariat has done an outstanding job in this area over a number of years and I must pay tribute to the individuals involved. There are now over 11,000 military and 3,000 civilian personnel from 54 countries serving in nine United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Middle East, the sub-continent, Cyprus, Angola and Central America. A further 2,700 personnel are on standby, ready to be sent to the Western Sahara. Five new peace-keeping or related operations have been approved in the first nine months of 1991 with UNTAC (United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) yet to come, placing an enormous strain on those parts of the Secretariat responsible for their creation and administration. Clearly, resources must be increased and upgraded and we welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of the team of consultants to report on how the organisation of peace-keeping activities might be improved in the light of these expanded responsibilities.\nIn a new climate of international cooperation it would be logical to anticipate an expanded role for the United Nations in peace-making or preventive diplomacy. The new international circumstances underline both the need and the opportunity for the United Nations to expand its hitherto successful but limited activity in this area. More often now than previously, the United Nations must be able to identify potential conflicts, analyse their reuses and bring the parties to see the possibilities for resolution of their differences while conflicts are still only at the dispute stage. This will require both new approaches to and additional resources in the Secretariat for Information gathering and conflict resolution. What is needed chiefly is a body of skilled and experienced staff who can not only analyse information, but develop options for action which can be presented to the Secretary-General or the Security Council.\nIn order to establish the conditions for a global peace, the United Nations must also intensify its work on disarmament and arms control. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency are cornerstones of arms control. Revelations about Iraq's extensive clandestine nuclear programme in violation of its NPT and safeguards obligations, the first and only such case in the history of the Treaty, have highlighted the need for an even more effective and an even more intrusive safeguards regime that can meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond. We have warmly welcomed the recent decisions of China, Prance, South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania to become parties to the NPT and hope that these decisions will help influence those few countries remaining outside the Treaty to re-evaluate the benefits of membership.\nWe also welcome the stated intention of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to sign a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, in accordance with the obligations it accepted on acceding to the NPT Treaty. We look forward to the full, prompt and unconditional implementation of that agreement, because we remain concerned at the continued operation by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of an unsafeguarded nuclear facility and at reports that it has been building other nuclear facilities, leaving open the question of whether it is pursuing a nuclear-weapons capability. This course of action by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is destabilising to the Korean peninsula and to the north Asian region generally.\nA universal and non-discriminatory register of conventional arms transfers under the auspices of the United Nations should also be established as soon as possible as an important international confidence-building measure. Australia participated in the United Nations expert group on conventional arms transfers. With the finalization of that group's recommendations and the support by the G-7 and the P-5 for the establishment of an arms transfer register, there is now an expectation of action by the international community.\nThe Gulf war underlined the crucial importance of a successful result to the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention. They have now entered a critical final stage. It is clear, however, that a further intensification of effort is required. The deadline of 1992 set by the Conference on Disarmament for completing the treaty must be observed. As I have proposed to my colleagues on the Conference on Disarmament, a meeting before too long of that Conference at the ministerial level will, in my view, be necessary to provide sufficient impetus for the negotiations and a political framework for resolving outstanding issues.\nThe Third Review Conference of the biological weapons Convention, held in Geneva last month, showed that there is a need for more to be done to further strengthen that important regime and, above all, to ensure that that Convention becomes universal.\nIn the new international environment, issues of international economic growth and development must take an even more prominent place on the agenda of the new Secretary-General. Substantial economic progress has been made in some regions, as for example, in parts of Asia and Latin America, but great human needs exist unaddressed, particularly in parts of Africa where, unfortunately, economic and social conditions have continued to deteriorate.\nIn the economic forums of the United Nations system, there is increasing recognition that each nation must be responsible for promoting policies that will encourage the participation of all sections of their populations in the economic and social development processes. Furthermore, a relationship is increasingly being noticed between human freedoms and sustained economic development. For the benefits of rational domestic policies to be fully realised, however, the major industrialised countries must play their part. They must maintain their efforts to foster greater stability in the international economic environment and take action to remove the international barriers to economic development.\nThe diminution in the security threat has enabled more resources to be available for development, both in the developing world and in central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But it will be important to ensure that assistance provided in eastern Europe be additional to levels of assistance to developing countries and not represent a diversion of resource flows away from them. The alleviation of poverty in the developing world remains the central humanitarian challenge.\nPerhaps most crucial, however, to the economic future of developed and developing countries is the need to strengthen and liberalise the multilateral trading system, both in the achievement of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round and in its aftermath. The importance of such liberalization was recognized in the United Nations international development strategy for the 1990s. Further liberalisation of trade would not only boost world economic growth, but engender the stability and confidence needed by the emerging market economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as providing an important stimulus to development efforts in Latin America, Asia and Africa.\nThe issues of peace and security and of development have of course been central to the deliberations and activities of the United Nations for many years. They are issues that have demonstrated the role and functions of previous Secretaries-General and are issues that I am sure that the new Secretary-General will know well. What is new for all of us is the emergence over just the last few years of a whole group of previously neglected issues for which international solutions are now actively being actively sought - issues, moreover, which for the most part generate quite strong feelings, are not readily susceptible to straightforward technical negotiation and settlement, and so require great skill in handling.\nUndoubtedly the most prominent recent addition to the new agenda has been the environment. While from the 1970s environmental protection became an important part of the domestic political programmes of many nations, it was not perceived than by moat governments as having an urgent international dimension. The 1980s saw a significant shift in both perceptions and reality and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil next year, will cast in relief the major new issues involved in the protection of the global environment in the face of the impact of climate change and increased threats to the biosphere. Every effort must be made to achieve ecologically sustainable development. As part of this process, due attention needs to be paid to the imperatives of economic growth and for appropriate mechanisms to be established for the transfer of technology to enable developing countries to meet the challenges involved in the protection of the environment. The interrelationship between protecting the global environment and ensuring global economic development will prove to be the critical issue as the end of the century approaches.\nHuman rights is not, of course, a new issue. The element of innovation lies in the way in which much past rhetoric of concern is now being translated into action, not only within the United Nations but in bodies such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The dramatic changes which have taken place in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe over the last few years have been matched by a significant diminution in the abuse of human rights. Equally there have been changes for the better in many parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. None the less, serious abuses continue, including in our own region - not least in Burma. We believe that further progress can be assisted through constructive dialogue of the kind that Australia actively pursues bilaterally and multilaterally. We believe it crucial that United\nNations human rights mechanisms be strengthened, and would encourage appropriate funding being provided within the United Nations system to accord resources for all human rights activities, including the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights.\nThe global refugee problem remains as large as ever. The challenge for Governments - and the international system - is to preserve the essential protections that must be extended to refugees while, at the same time, providing other appropriate responses and humanitarian assistance for persons displaced by other causes.\nThe United Nations will, regrettably, need to continue to respond to natural disasters and other large-scale humanitarian emergencies which occur around the world. Like other countries, Australia has been concerned for some time that coordination among the various organisations involved in United Nations humanitarian emergency relief is sometimes inadequate to the need. We wish to see improved coordination of such responses. What we need to devise in any General Assembly resolution is not some facile cosmetic response, but a carefully considered mechanism which actually works in practice.\nIn the aftermath of the Gulf war we have seen the United Nations revisit the key question of intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. The Charter notes explicitly that the United Nations is not authorised \\\"to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State\\\". Yet there are also basic goals in the United Nations Charter, in particular in the social and humanitarian area, which have always qualified the principle of non-intervention. The monitoring machinery successfully being developed by the Commission on Human Rights is but one example of how the balance struck between considerations of sovereignty and humanitarian imperatives has evolved.\nToday we can readily endorse the Secretary-General's view in this year's annual report \\\"that the principle of non-interference with the essential domestic jurisdiction of States cannot be regarded as a protective barrier behind which human rights could be massively or systematically violated with impunity.\\\" (A/46/l, p. 10) The United Nations role in Iraq following the war, while governed by the enforcement provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter, underlined, nevertheless, that sometimes such United Nations action is needed in the face of great humanitarian emergencies which threaten international peace and security even though there may be no agreement from the Member State most directly concerned. He are not yet at the stage where we can prescribe new activity or, indeed. Charter amendment for the United Nations to enable it greater flexibility to cope with such situations. But we have to recognize that there may be cases where a more flexible approach is in fact needed if the United Nations is to meet its global objectives successfully.\nThere is thus a widespread consensus that the present unwieldy Secretariat structure - the product of the conflict and compromises of the cold war and the uncoordinated responses to specific problems of the past - is not well suited to the range of tasks which Member States now expect of the United Nations and which, in the new international climate, it should be capable of performing. It is unreasonable to impose on the incoming  Secretary-General a structure which he or she will find so much difficulty in managing, which reflects past problems, not present realities, and which the new Secretary-General, as chief administrative officer, has had no input in shaping.\nAustralia would thus support a resolution in the General Assembly which would sweep sway these constraints on the Secretary-General and which would, on the basis of consultation with the incoming Secretary-General, establish procedures to ensure the recruitment from all regions of the most outstanding men and women to work in the Secretariat, and set out a new basic structure for the Secretariat which would permit it to fulfil its roles in the development of policy options to assist the deliberative organs and in the implementation of their decisions. The detailed elaboration of the basic structure should be the responsibility of the Secretary-General as the United Nation's chief administrative officer.\nUltimately, it will be for Member States and for the new Secretary-General to acknowledge that if the United Nations is, indeed, to become the sort of organization which its founders foresaw, now is the time. Never since the end of the Second World War has there been so much hope. That hope has to be translated into political will: to achieve and maintain peace, to better the economic lot of mankind, and to permit the individual to live decently and free from fear. In fulfilling this role the United Nations must be purposeful, energetic and adaptable. Its ultimate success will depend on the capacity of Member States to work together in the common interest. The achievement of which the United Nations is capable is worth the effort of all of us to bring about.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe take great pleasure in participating in this session of the General Assembly under the wise presidency of Ambassador Shihabi. His election to this high post is a tribute to his country, Saudi Arabia, for the enhanced role it has been playing in international relations, and is at the same time public recognition of his personal and professional qualities as an experienced and accomplished diplomat. He wish him every success in the accomplishment of his mandate and we pledge to him all our cooperation as he discharges his difficult but also noble task.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, we express our appreciation for the dedicated and competent manner in which he led the work of the forty-fifth session.\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, on the successes registered in various fields and on his personal commitment to helping find peaceful solutions for international conflicts. Under his leadership the United Nations, after many years of stagnation, has had a productive period in pursuance of its purposes and in the implementation of its principles.\nWe warmly welcome the admission as new Members of the Organization of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, as well as the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. The admission of these seven countries is an important event in international politics which contributes towards the consolidation of the ideal of universality of the United Nations and is the result of the profound political changes that the world has undergone over recent years. \nWe are witnessing the dawn of a new era in the life of peoples and in the relations among nations. The world is undergoing profound national changes and adjustments, whose final results will, we hope, be the redefinition of International relations, this time based upon mutual respect, the freedom and self-determination of peoples, respect for the democratic ideal and human rights, and economic cooperation between States. A new international order seems to be taking shape and consolidating after decades of political frustrations and uncertainties inherited from the Second World War.\nThe relations among States have been in the past, and in large measure still are, very much influenced by the pressure exerted by some countries over others, by the policies of spheres of influence, by violations of fundamental norms governing relations among nations and by economic disparity between the North and the South, which have given rise to enormous poverty and left a sizeable area of the planet economically underdeveloped.\nOn the other hand, at the national level, the history of the peoples has recorded painful episodes of flagrant violations of fundamental human rights, political repression and the denial of liberty to the citizens. The new world order, which is talked about so much nowadays and which I am sure most of us would like to see taking hold, should be based upon different premises and pursue objectives that more adequately meet the requirements and the humanism of our time.\nThe ongoing political changes in the world are most encouraging. The upsurge in the affirmation of the right of self-determination and independence of peoples in countries that not long ago felt powerless to assert, their will and give expression to their freedom, as well as the desire for democracy expressed throughout the world, seems to foretell the emergence of this new world. Today more than ever before, democracy is sought after by the peoples of the world, whatever their developmental status, cultural background or history. The indomitable desire for freedom and aspirations to democracy are today shared throughout the world.\nIn the countries of Eastern Europe, the monolithic power structure which for decades suppressed the legitimate aspirations of their citizens is now falling apart, in the face of the deep desire for freedom and the expressed will of the peoples to take their destinies into their own hands.\nIn Africa the peoples are becoming restless and reacting against the economic and social backwardness in which they find themselves as a result of, among other factors, negative policies implemented over the years. All over the continent the peoples are clearly demonstrating their willingness to shoulder the responsibility for their destinies, to express their political aspirations in freedom, to redefine their objectives and to rethink their political organisations on the basis of the values of pluralism and respect for the dignity of the human being. \nThe recent political changes that took place In Cape Verde are to be viewed within the context of the current social movement for profound political changes in Africa and are part and parcel of the expression of the same desire for liberty and the fruit of the same aspiration of all peoples for real democracy.\nThrough free and fair democratic elections that reflected the aspirations of its people, Cape Verde has today a government that operates within the confines of democratic institutions and with strict respect for the freedom and political rights of all citizens.\nThe democratic process taking place in Cape Verde is, because of its seriousness, a valuable contribution to the global effort of democratisation and respect for the liberty and fundamental rights of all human beings.\nWith the establishment of a democratic society, we believe we have created the conditions that will allow the Cape Verdean people to engage freely and enthusiastically in the building of a better and more just future for itself.\nWe witness in many countries a climate conducive to human rights violations. Although we all preach adherence to international norms and proclaim the need to protect human rights, the fact of the matter is that we still live in a world where arbitrary imprisonment, torture and the denial of the most fundamental human rights predominate. Every day in various corners of the world there are people who suffer and die at the hands of those who, to preserve the political status quo, disregard the most elementary rights of the citizens.\nUnfortunately, the violation of human rights seems to be a universal plague. In countries where a monolithic structure of power predominates, the violation of human rights is normally rooted in a need to preserve political power. In some countries that receive migrant workers - although most of the time governed by democratic regimes - one witnesses violations of human rights on the basis of the discrimination to which those migrant workers fall victim. In some countries with diverse cultural and ethnic groups, violations of human rights are also translated into the denial of rights to the ethnic or cultural minorities.\nAny violation of human rights, whether to attain certain political goals or pursue some economic objectives or based on cultural, ethnic or other considerations, should he condemned outright by the United Nations.\nWe believe that the United Nations should be more active in the search for a solution of .these and other weak areas of our international activity in the protection of human rights. The existing United Nations mechanisms and the current applicable legal instruments deserve a more focused attention on the part of all those who are serious about the protection of human rights as a major endeavour on the United Nations agenda in today's world.\nThe need for better mechanisms and for more efficient United Nations action in these fields becomes evident in situations of civil war where systematic, gross and generalized violations of human rights assume alarming proportions.\nLately we have witnessed all sorts of crimes against the populations of certain countries torn by civil war, from arbitrary imprisonment to indiscriminate killing. That is even more alarming is that the United Nations witnesses all these crimes, incapable of taking measures to save lives or protect the defenceless population.\nExisting United Nations mechanisms are ineffective in coping with such situations. Although the principle of sovereignty of countries is sacred to all of us and one that we staunchly defend, we believe that sovereignty should be seen as a shield to protect the people and not as an instrument, a weapon to be used against their basic rights or to annihilate them.\nWe believe that the conditions should be created in the United Nations to respond effectively to these unfortunate situations in order to protect defenceless populations and shield them from atrocities. In this context we share the ideas expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organisation.\nOn the other hand, violations of the rights of minorities are also a source of concern for us. Cape Verde is a country with a homogenous population without any significant cultural or ethnic minorities. We none the less remain sensitive to acts of discrimination against minorities and to any violation of their rights.\nWe believe that no group, however large, has the right to preach: nor should it have the arrogance to impose less favourable treatment on another group, however small it might be. Every individual, by virtue of his own human nature, is endowed with the same rights and deserving of equal protection irrespective of his birthplace, skin colour, economic condition, ethnic background or political or religious convictions. Here again the United Nations needs to strengthen its existing mechanisms with a view to providing effective protection for minorities.\nWe hope that the World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place in 1993 in Berlin under the auspices of the United Nations, will help find an answer to these problems. If today democracy seems to be part of our common culture and respect for the protection of human rights deserves the support of all countries, then economic development should equally be a major concern to us all. Democracy and the protection of human rights do not by themselves warrant the much-needed political stability of nations. Democracy and human rights alone cannot ensure the well-being and happiness of peoples and are certainly not a substitute for economic development. Certainly, democracy and the protection of human rights are indispensable conditions for creating a favourable climate for development, but development that is in and of itself an important factor in consolidating democracy also requires human and material resources and a policy aimed at creating a prosperous and wealthy society.\nThe developing countries have long struggled to create better living conditions for their populations. Many of these countries seem to have lost the struggle owing to various negative factors, among them a negative economic climate, notwithstanding enormous efforts undertaken.\nWe believe it to be in the interest of the international community that development problems be seen and solved as global problems affecting all of us. There cannot be any doubt today that the poverty of peoples has a direct impact on the environmental conditions which have a negative repercussion on the quality of our lives. On the other hand, underdevelopment and the poverty it generates are a constant source of political and social instability, whose negative impact on the world economy is evident.\nWe have come to a stage in international affairs where everything seems to depend on everything else. We believe that now that there seems to be a more realistic approach towards dealing with international issues, we should take advantage of this unique historical opportunity to face economic problems that for long have been crippling the political stability and the social fabric of developing nations.\nThe idea of a new world order requires serious consideration of the economic problems which have plunged millions upon millions of human beings into misery, which have kept the majority of countries in a constant state of political instability, and which have been a negative factor in the process of democratisation.\nHere again, we share the view expressed by the Secretary-General that perhaps the time has come to reactivate the process of global negotiations. The reactivation of global negotiations is an issue as momentous as the fact that the poverty affecting a sizeable portion of the world's populations and the underdevelopment of many countries also have harmful consequences - more obvious today than ever before - on the environment.\nThe neglect of the environment over the centuries and the uncontrolled economic exploitation during past decades have had catastrophic results throughout the world. The danger to the environment that we face today is well documented: rain that does not fall, land that becomes desert,  forests that disappear, species that become extinct, the ozone layer that is depleted, and a host of other environmental problems. These environmental problems require prompt global solutions. The issue of the environment, perhaps more than any other on the international agenda, is a clear example of the necessity to tackle collectively all the global problems we face today.\nIf we want to find adequate cures for environmental ailments - and we shall have to find them, for what is at stake is our own survival - we should, at the same time, endeavour to solve the economic problems, a main factor in the degradation of the environment. The dangers to the environment have been identified and there is a deep awareness of the necessity to protect the environment. Solutions that are required to correct the mistakes of the past are within our reach. Political courage is, however, necessary to ensure the means and the resources to solve the environmental problems.\nThe Conference on Environment and Development, to take place in Brazil in 1992, will give us a unique opportunity seriously to evaluate the environmental situation with a view to finding realistic solutions. Cape Verde, a country seriously affected by drought and desertification, attaches the greatest importance to this Conference. The United Nations will have an opportunity there to play an important role in establishing world policies to protect our common environment.\nThe United Nations is becoming increasingly important in a world where global problems can be only solved through collective decisions. International peace and security depends today more than ever before on collective actions by the United Nations. We rejoice in its increasingly active role in the preservation of the peace and security of nations, particularly the small nations. In this context, it gives us particular satisfaction to see Kuwait today restored as a sovereign and Independent country, in all its dignity. We hope that events like this one, which profoundly shook the world, will never again take place. The Gulf crisis once again emphasised the fundamental and central role of the United Nations as the only guarantor of the sovereignty and independence of nations, as well as the imperative necessity for countries to respect the principle of the non-use of force in their international relations and to observe, at all costs, the United Nations principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nThe security of Cape Verde, as a small country, as well as that of many other countries Members of the Organisation, depends on respect for, and the increased assertiveness of, international law. For us, strict observance of the Charter principles and norms is of particular significance in creating and preserving a stable world.\nIn this framework, we feel duty-bound to remind all countries here represented of the untold suffering still being inflicted upon the East Timorese people, whose right of self-determination has been blatantly denied, in flagrant violation of the principles and norms of decolonization. We think it is high time that all peace-loving countries really committed to defending the Charter principles supported the East Timorese people's right of self-determination, with a view to putting an end to the colonial and illegal occupation of this Territory, in accordance with United Nations precepts. We believe that renewed efforts should be made to that end. In this regard, it is our view that countries that bear a special responsibility in the United Nations should play a pivotal role in helping find a United Nations solution for the Timor situation. It will be difficult, especially in the contest of a new world order, for these countries to convince the world that they are serious about ensuring that the principles and norms of the Charter are respected and upheld by all nations if they themselves turn a blind eye to the colonial situation of East Timor.\nOn the other hand, we are glad to note that a peaceful mechanism has been found for the Western Sahara question. We maintain that the framework for the solution of this question is the one defined in the United Nations peace plan. We believe that for the plan to be fully implemented, an envisaged, the parties concerned should cooperate with the Secretary-General and honour their commitments as well as the results of the referendum, with all its implications. \nThe new world that seems to be unfolding before us should be guided by the philosophy of respect for the principles and norms of international law and by the recognition of the role of the United Nations, first and foremost the Security Council, in the settlement of international conflicts.\nAfter the confrontational era that characterised decades of cold war and the ideological warfare that thwarted the important United Nations function of maintaining peace and security, the Security Council is today in a favourable position to become an effective collective instrument to ensure respect for international legality and impose observance of the principles and norms which govern peaceful and harmonious relations among States.\nIt is evident that today no single country, however developed and whatever its military might, can alone solve the problems that affect all nations. It has become clear that global problems require global responses that can only be found within and through the collective action of the United Nations.\nIn order to respond promptly and adequately to these and other international needs, the United Nations will have to adapt to the requirements of today's world. This adaptation will call for some concrete reforms in the Organization and its Charter. The need for United Nations reform has already led to some administrative and financial adjustments in its structure and more recently in the functioning of the Economic and Social Council. The increased hope that the peoples of the world seems to place in the United Nations as a forum to solve important problems affecting the world might also require adjustments in its political organs and institutions.\nWe believe, however, that any United Nations reform should be oriented not towards creating new spheres of influence or ascribing special powers and privileges to certain countries, but should be guided by the objectives of a\nnew world order based on justice amongst nations, the sovereign equality of all countries, the equal participation of all members in international decisions on collective issues, the protection of States against aggression, and international economic cooperation.\nThe last decades of this century have spawned many dangerous and complex events - conflicts between states; catastrophic economic situations that have condemned many generations to misery; abuses of and crimes against human rights; political agitation; and permanent world tension under the threat of a nuclear holocaust.\nIt is satisfying to note today, however, that the last years of the last decade initiated a totally new climate of political detente in the world and brewed a number of political events whose positive effects on the relationship between nations gave a new dimension to the activity of this Organisation and made possible political cooperation between the two major Powers. These developments augur well for our common future, which we hope will be more peaceful and devoted to cooperation between countries.\nThe international situation unfolding before us seems to announce a new era in our collective endeavours, an era governed by values to be universally observed, such as respect for the political aspirations and self-determination of peoples; collective measures to protect the environment; universal respect for fundamental human rights; increased international economic cooperation; and respect for international law and United Nations decisions. Only a new international order that promotes those values can ensure our collective survival.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Ugandan delegation I wish to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His election to that high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and a reflection of the high esteem in which his country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is held. He brings to the office a wealth of experience and diplomatic skill which will be useful as the Assembly grapples with the major issues before this session. I assure him of the full cooperation of the Ugandan delegation in the discharge of his responsibilities. To his predecessor. Mr. Guido de Marco, Foreign Minister of Malta, my delegation expresses its most sincere appreciation for the skill and dispatch with which he guided the deliberations of the forty-fifth session.\nI wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, few his exemplary service to the Organisation. For the decade he has been at its helm, the Organisation has faced great, challenges, some of which brought Into question Its very relevance and viability. Because of his dedication, perseverance and insight, Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, contributed substantially to the strengthening of this body and helped overcome many of those challenges. We are now all happy to note that the United Nations role as a focal point for harmonizing international actions, and as a repository for our collective efforts for peace, security and cooperation has been strengthened.\nIn Africa, we commend the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts and determination in helping to solve our problems; notably the critical economic situation in our region and the conflicts prevalent there.\nThanks to the Secretary-General's constant attention to our problems, Africa's hope and confidence in the United Nations remain solid and show every sign of growing stronger. In turn, Africa would like to believe that the international community regards it as a serious partner, mature enough to be entrusted with greater responsibilities. Here, I ask to be allowed to stress that the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Ibrahim Babangida, President of the Republic of Nigeria, spoke for all of us when he urged that the Security Council be restructured and that serious consideration be given to the election of an African to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nAllow me to welcome the seven new Members to the United Nations. Uganda welcomes Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which have just regained their independence. Since our independence, Uganda has had friendly and diplomatic relations with both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. We are therefore happy to see their joint admission to the United Nations. Together with the admissions of the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, the Organization has come closer to attaining its goal of universality.\nIn the past year, we have all witnessed the momentous changes that have led to a fundamental transformation in international relations. The far-reaching developments in Eastern Europe have altered the political and economic terrain in which we have been operating. Indeed, so changed is the landscape that the international community is grappling with the construction of a new world order which, we hope, will usher in an era of cooperation, rather than confrontation and free the world from the narrow confines of ideological bloc mindset.\nUnderstandably, there are great expectations as we look to the prospect of a new world order. The political and economic structures of many countries, and the nature of relations between countries, have evolved in ways that could not have been contemplated a few years ago. However, the prevailing sense of euphoria should not lull us into complacency. We still have a number of hurdles to cross. If we are to seize the opportunities beckoning us on the horizon, the leaders of this generation need, for their part, to have-vision and a high degree of statesmanship. But they also need the attention and the support of the international community.\nThe order to which we are aspiring can be viable only if it la, and is seen to be, just and equitable. It can be just and equitable only if its architecture and management are safely anchored in the precepts of the Charter. First, the new order will be on a firm foundation if it promotes, as the Charter dictates, fundamental human rights and conforms to the clear desire of mankind for peace, democracy and the rule of law, both within and between nations.\nIt is now pertinent for me to express Uganda's concern at the recent developments in Haiti, and to commend the initiative of the Organisation of American States in a sincere effort to help restore democratic order in that country.\nSecondly, the new order should address the problem of the economic and social development of all countries. It therefore becomes imperative to address the glaringly visible gap between the North and the South, reflecting affluence on one hand and abject poverty and deprivation on the other.\nA fundamental goal of the United Nations is to bring about the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Its efforts in that regard were long encumbered by the cold war, which more often than not fanned the flames of war in various regions. The conflicts in those regions made it attractive for massive quantities of sophisticated weapons to be transferred, by all camps, to fragile States and areas of tension in the third world. Arms transfers became lucrative business for the developed countries which have the technology and resources to produce weapons. The readiness of the developed countries to provide developing countries with armaments contrasts very sharply with their response to similar requests for the transfer of financial resources and technology for the purpose of development. It is our hope that, in the light of recent developments, that trend will be reversed and that our appeals for economic transformation will be responded to with vigour and imagination.\nMany speakers have supported the proposal for a register of international transfers of conventional weapons. That proposal is appealing. In our view, for such a register to be meaningful it must be balanced and transparent. It must also cover the producer countries and provide a country-by-country inventory of all armaments produced, stockpiled or transferred. Furthermore, transparency should encompass information on state-of-the-art technology in the military field, as this would engender confidence and alleviate the fear of surprises. It should also be possible to set up an inspection mechanism for verification of such a register. \nWe are happy to see that the opportunity presented by the relaxation of tension has been seized to advance the cause of disarmament. The agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of strategic arms is very encouraging. Equally encouraging were the announcement by President Bush on Friday, 27 September 1991, regarding further, unilateral, reductions in United States armaments and the recent response by President Gorbachev of the USSR. Taken together, those three achievements represent a major step forward and provide a timely impetus for the disarmament process.\nWe believe that further discussions should aim at even deeper reductions in nuclear arsenals and limit the qualitative improvement of such arsenals. Priorities in the disarmament field, in our view, should include negotiations oil a comprehensive test-ban treaty, the speedy conclusion of a chemical-weapons convention and an increase in the effectiveness of the biological-weapons Convention. Given the momentum attained and the objectives aimed for,, there is a strong case for urging that the resources released by disarmament be channelled to the development of the poor countries. The linkage between disarmament and development must remain in focus in our deliberations.\nThe international community has accorded human rights their rightful significance. This is proper because threats to peace and security do not arise only from external provocation and aggression. In a number of instances the underlying cause of tension is a failure to respect human rights. He also know that the violation of human rights contributes materially towards the burgeoning refugee problem in the third world. The Secretary-General, in his annual report, advises that the principle of non-interference in the essential jurisdiction of States cannot be regarded as a protective barrier behind which human rights could be massively or systematically violated with Impunity. The same view has been articulated by many speakers in this debate. We agree. Human rights violations should be condemned and redressed wherever they are perpetrated. The international community has a vital role to play in this regard.\nIn order to assist the new generation of leaders who are committed to the democratisation process and the defence of human rights, we need to be realistic and to advocate practical innovations which are capable of bringing about the necessary institutional changes peacefully; otherwise the whole process might abort due to institutional resistance. The situations in Haiti and, to a lesser extent, in Togo are cases in point.\nFurthermore, we believe that if human rights and democracy are to be meaningful, it is critical that developing countries be assisted in attaining an adequate standard of living. Civil and political rights must go hand in hand with equally important economic, social and cultural rights. The international community has in the past been preoccupied with the progressive development of norms of human rights and the monitoring of their observance. While this is important, equal importance should be given to assisting developing countries to enhance their exogenous capacity to ensure the observance of those norms. For universal peace, security and respect of human rights to be safeguarded, it is an advantage also to have corresponding economic and social development.\nRegrettably, the external environment for developing countries continues to be unfavourable. Resource flows in general have dwindled, commodity prices have tumbled and the external debt crisis has deepened, causing the predictable political and social hardships for the population in many of developing countries to worsen.\nIn most cases the main problem has not been the lack of programmes to address the issues, but rather the political will and commitment necessary to enable them to be fulfilled. This is the case with the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1966 and whose final review was undertaken last month by the Ad Hoc Committee of the General Assembly. In that regard, Uganda commends the tireless efforts of the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, Mr. Martin Huslid, the Permanent Representative of Norway to the United Nations. While most African countries undertook structural adjustment programmes, the response of the international community fell short of expectations. Transfer of financial resources did not materialize as envisaged. Accordingly, the Programme of Action on the whole remains un-implemented while Africa's critical economic situation continues to deteriorate.\nIt is our hope that within the context of the proposed new agenda for Africa now before the General Assembly, the international community will show the required political will and provide the tangible support necessary for its renewal and implementation.\nI wish to take this opportunity to welcome the initiative by the Government of Japan on the African economic summit proposed for 1993. It is our hope that an outcome of that summit will be serious commitments on the part of the international community for increased resource flows for the development of Africa.\nWe recognise that the development of Africa is our primary responsibility and that others can only complement our efforts. As a strategy for development, regional cooperation and integration have assumed priority attention in Africa. To this end, the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community was adopted at the Abuja summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in June 1991. The Treaty is designed to expand our markets, create forward and backward linkages in our economies and hence act as a motor for Africa's growth and development on a sustained basis. The United Nations and the international community should be supportive of our integration efforts.\nBecause of our economic problems, we have had to adopt structural adjustment programmes which invariably involve deep cuts in expenditures on social programmes such as health and education, and the laying off of workers. This has had a direct negative impact on vulnerable groups who have in turn been forced to put further pressure on the environment. Clearly, these groups need special assistance to alleviate their plight. This is not a novel idea. We know that in the developed countries there are special arrangements to assist these groups. Such arrangements are all the more necessary in our countries, where they have to apply to the poorest in the poorest of countries: the least developed countries. Failure to address this problem would undermine the democratic system and institutions which we are committed to put in place in our countries.\nAfrica is overwhelmingly dependent, for its export earnings, on a narrow range of primary commodities. Diversification into non-traditional exports and the exporting of value-added processed commodities have become a priority for us. We therefore support all efforts towards the early conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It is our hope that those negotiations will result in, among other things, improved market access for the processed and semi-processed goods of all developing countries.\nPreparations for the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment, and Development are under way. The Conference has given rise to a lot of hope and expectations. Our view is that its outcome should include specific commitments on the effective transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries, on non-commercial terms; the provision of adequate new and additional resources, on concessional terms; and a supportive international economic environment that promotes sustainable economic growth and development in the developing countries.\nIn the case of the developing countries, environmental degradation is a direct consequence of poverty. Discussion of environmental issues in isolation from development is meaningless. For example, in Uganda and elsewhere in Africa people are forced to cut down trees for fuel and for use in constructing dwellings, If forests are to be preserved, alternative sources of energy and of building materials must be secured. For Uganda, as well as some other African countries, the solution lies in securing capital and technology to harness hydro-electric power. This is where the industrialized countries should give a helping hand. \nThis Organization has taken a principled stand against racism, of which apartheid is the worst manifestation. Apartheid is a long-standing problem, which has destabilised the whole of southern Africa. There appears to be hope that a solution is in sight. The repeal of the Land Act, the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act points in this direction and should be welcomed. We welcome also the other initiatives - particularly the tripartite talks between the leaders of the African National Congress, Inkatha and the South African Government. But our goal in South Africa remains the dismantling of apartheid, with a view to achieving full respect for human and political rights and the establishment of a democratic and non-racial South Africa.\nOur position is that the constitution of South Africa is the basic foundation of apartheid. Until that constitution is scrapped and replaced by one that involves the participation, on equal terms, of all South African people, we shall not be able to say that the process of dismantling apartheid has become irreversible. He therefore call upon the South African Government to muster the necessary political will to embrace the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter and to enter into substantive and conclusive negotiations, which should culminate in a truly democratic political system that accords human and political rights to all.\nHe have always argued that the problem of apartheid in South Africa is a source of instability in the region as a whole. Some of the positive developments in South Africa, coupled with the end of the cold war, have led to positive trends in the front-line States as well. The agreement between the Government of Angola and UNITA augurs well for that country. It promises to bring an end to the fratricidal war that has cost many lives and crippled\nAngola's economic and social infrastructures. In Mozambique, the Government has shown great boldness in agreeing to engage RENAMO in the negotiations aimed at ending the war. It is regrettable that, so far, RENAMO has not demonstrated seriousness in its approach. It remains our hope that these talks will, in the end, be fruitful.\nFront-line States have played, and continue to play, a critical role in the struggle against apartheid. They have made enormous sacrifices in terms of loss of human life and damage to their economies. They deserve support and compensation for the loss consequent upon their bearing the brunt of this struggle. The General Assembly and the Security Council have on numerous occasions called upon the international community to assist the front-line States. We appeal to the international community to respond positively to this call.\nThe question of Western Sahara has been one of the most conspicuous problems in our region. We are confident that, with the adoption of Security Council resolution 690 (1991), which sets out a plan for a settlement and establishes the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, the referendum will be held as soon as possible. Uganda will continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General in this endeavour.\nThe situation in Liberia and in some parts of eastern Africa is a source of anguish. Uganda's approach is to support regional efforts to promote dialogue and understanding between the parties, with a view to the cessation of the fighting and the provision of long-term solutions. We have therefore supported the initiative of the Economic Community of West African States in the case of the situation in Liberia, and the efforts of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development as regards the conflict in the Horn o\u00a3 Africa. In our own subregion, Uganda is committed to a comprehensive solution to the problem of refugees, which was agreed on by our Heads of State in February this year in the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration. Implementation of that Declaration would go a long way towards furthering the cause of peace and good-neighbourliness in the region. The international community should be supportive of our regional efforts to find solutions.\nThe Middle East continues to be a volatile region, and the situation in the area has grave implications for international peace and security. The Gulf area has just gone through the trauma of the war arising from Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. We are happy that the sovereignty, independence and legitimate Government of Kuwait have been restored, and we applaud the steadfastness of the Security Council in this regard. Needless to say, the war had a devastating impact, in terms of the loss of human lives and of material and environmental destruction, on both countries and on the region. The challenge facing the international community in the post-war period is therefore immense and daunting. Having stood up to the challenge of aggression, the United Nations should equally rise to the challenge of fashioning a settlement that would provide a long-term solution.\nThe international community acted with courage in addressing the Gulf crisis. Equal boldness is called for as regards the twin question of Palestine and Arab- Israeli relations, which remain the core of the Middle East conflict. The General Assembly, in resolution 38/58 C, called for a United Nations international conference on the Middle East, to be attended by all parties concerned, as a framework for the negotiation of a just settlement. The efforts of the United States of America to have a limited international conference convened on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) are a positive development. In spite of the onerous demands being made by Israel as regards the Palestinian representation, the Arab countries' response has been constructive. Israel, on the other hand, has continued its provocative policies of constructing new settlements in the occupied territories for Jewish immigrants. Uganda hopes that wiser counsel will prevail in Israel and that the United Nations and the international community as a whole will show determination and perseverance in the search for a just and peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nUganda supports the independence, unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus and the aspiration of its people to live together. We call on both sides to cooperate with the Secretary-General in his efforts to find an acceptable settlement.\nAs regards the Korean peninsula, Uganda has been supportive of the aspiration of its people for peaceful reunification. The simultaneous admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations provides that people with yet another opportunity to continue dialogue and to further their reconciliation and confidence-building efforts. In Kampuchea, we are encouraged by the progress registered in the negotiations. A breakthrough has been attained, and Uganda joins other delegations in welcoming to this Assembly Prince Sihanouk in his capacity as Head of State. Uganda looks forward to the adoption and signature of an agreement on Kampuchea at a reconvened Paris conference.\nAs regards the Afghan crisis, our view remains that all countries should respect the Geneva accords.\nThe world needs an effective United Nations to manage our interdependence. As regards the reform process in the United Nations, Uganda is supportive of those proposals that are aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the Organization. The framework adopted in General Assembly Resolution 45/264 provides an agreed basis for further negotiations on reforms in the United Nations.\nThe end of the cold war has provided our generation with a unique opportunity to work in partnership to advance the collective interests of our global village. As members of this global community the generations of the next millennium will judge us on the basis of whether our legacy to them is an order of justice, equity, peace and freedom, and whether or not the well-being of man is at the centre of that order.\nAllow me now to make some comments on Rwanda. For his own reasons, the Head of the delegation of Rwanda, Mr. Francois Ngarukiyintwali, elected to raise the issue of Rwanda in this Assembly last Monday and to raise it with the objective of characterising Uganda as an aggressor or as a party to the conflict in his country.\nUganda has all along rejected and refuted such accusations, and I do so once again. It is the considered view of my delegation that the interests of the people of Rwanda, those within Rwanda as well as the very substantial numbers who live in exile abroad, would be best served if Rwanda reciprocated the goodwill of its neighbours, of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as well as of several friendly countries, and committed itself to the implementation of solutions collectively arrived at in various forums specially convened to address the Rwanda problem. It is as disappointing, as it is fruitless, for Rwanda to be under the illusion that by finding a scapegoat in Uganda the problem of about a million Rwandese living in forced exile will go away.\nWe may recall the upheaval in Rwanda is 1959 just before the independence of that country, when the monarchy and the then ruling class, consisting almost exclusively of the Tutsi people, were violently overthrown. The massive bloody incidents that accompanied that upheaval forced many of the Tutsi victims to go into exile in all neighbouring countries, including Uganda. Up to this day, Rwanda has failed to evolve and implement a policy of reconciliation to attract back to their motherland these Rwandese exiles. About 100,000 of these exiles live in Uganda, and we would be greatly relieved if another home were found for them. It is some of these aggrieved exiles who took up arms and are engaged in armed conflict inside Rwanda against the Government there.\nEver since this conflict broke out, the African leaders in the region and at the level of the OAU, including the Chairman, have met on more than 10 occasions in search of a peaceful solution to the Rwanda problem. The last such meeting was held only last month on 7 September, at Gbadolite in Zaire, under the chairmanship of President Babangida, Chairman of the OAU, and attended by the OAU Secretary General and by Zaire, Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda. The meeting reached unanimous - I repeat, unanimous - agreement on an action plan to resolve the armed conflict. The two belligerent parties were to Implement a cease-fire agreement previously agreed upon and signed by them, and they were to enter into a dialogue on 15 September 1991 under President Mobutu's mediation. The cease-fire was to be monitored by an OAU neutral Military Observer Group comprised of Nigeria and Zaire. This is the framework for resolving the armed conflict in Rwanda which calls for Rwanda's commitment and international support; verbal assaults against Uganda or any other country are nothing but manifestations of escapism.\nEarlier, in March, a similar framework for peace had been reached under the N'sele Agreement; and the report of the OAU Monitoring Team for the period March-September is available to anyone who wishes to verify Rwanda's allegations against Uganda. These allegations are entirely baseless.\nIn February this year, a regional conference under the chairmanship of President Mwinyi of Tanzania and with the participation of Rwanda, Zaire, Burundi and Uganda, as well as of the OAU Secretary General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), was held in Dar-es-Salaam for the purpose of agreeing on a permanent solution to the refugee problem in the region. Although under the agreement Rwanda accepted its responsibility to receive back its nationals in exile under the principle of voluntary repatriation, we have yet to see concrete steps being taken by Rwanda to create conditions there that would make repatriation an attractive proposition. Rwanda's attitude and record in this regard should be compared to those of it neighbours, which also hove had to grapple with similar problems.\nUganda stands ready to give every reasonable cooperation to promote all initiatives so far undertaken to resolve both the Rwandese refugee problem and the armed conflict in Rwanda, but Uganda takes strong exception to Rwanda's impotence in carrying out its obligations to its nationals in exile and its ravelling instead in diversionary tactics and provocative attacks against Uganda.\nRwanda is running the danger of proving to be an ungrateful neighbour. Uganda is providing a livelihood to 100,000 Rwandese nationals who are denied a home in their country. Uganda made its territory available to Rwandese troops in a sincere effort to help Rwanda monitor the border. Uganda Invited the OAU Monitoring Team, as well as foreign envoys, to verify Rwanda's allegations of rebel bases in Uganda. All this, and more, was done to promote transparency and build confidence in regional initiatives. Rwanda seems to have elected to ignore all Uganda's goodwill and assistance and would rather engage in a purposeless propaganda campaign abroad, including here in this Assembly. It is a matter of profound regret.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, allow me to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in meeting his responsibilities.\nAllow me to express my appreciation, as well, to Mr. De Marco, his predecessor, who represents a small country, yet had the courage to point to some of the Organisation's major problems. He did so with a decisiveness that has few precedents.\nIt is also my most pleasant obligation to thank the Secretary-General. In guiding the Organisation, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar demonstrated a noble vision. The broad outlook of this politician proved to be in concert with our times. His integrity and assurance deserve our admiration.\nLet me welcome our new Members: the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. We look forward to the active contribution of these new Members, and are prepared to cooperate closely with them on the various items on our agenda.\nLast year's session was the first I attended as Foreign Minister of a country freed from totalitarianism. Since then, I have reflected seriously upon the role of the United Nations in this world of ours, which has changed so much. Why, I have wondered, was the Organization's contribution to putting an end to the cold war only a modest one, even though it was founded to maintain peace?\nI represent one of the countries that over the past two years has experienced a dramatic transformation on the road to democracy. This transformation is helping to change the political map of the world, and so perhaps we have a certain right, even an obligation, to judge how capable the United Nations is of adapting to new impulses and reacting to them for the general welfare. I hope therefore that I may be excused for abandoning tradition and relegating comments on individual items on this year's agenda to discussions in the Main Committees.\nAllow me to paraphrase the words that President Havel used two years ago to address the situation in my own country. Our organisation too is not exactly flourishing! Its history is very controversial. Successes combine with failures.\nVery soon after the Second World War, the United Nations, with so many hopes invested in it, turned into a cold war battlefield. It was dramatically influenced by the false concept of the so-called international class struggle. It failed to cope with flagrant violations of its own Charter and of international law. The most painful failure, from my perspective, occurred, of course, in 1968 when Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Warsaw Treaty countries.\nLater, during the era of so-called super-Power detente, we all witnessed the United Nations turn into a forum for rhetorical somersaults that concealed its inability to solve real problems effectively. We witnessed the gradual withering of the idea of multilateralism and of the last remnants of the Organization's prestige. Even disapproval on the part of the vast majority of Member States did not prevent this very forum from being desecrated by people who defended aggression and violence.\nAnd yet, the Organization played a substantial role in decolonization. It contributed to the evolution and codification of international law. It served us all as an umbrella sheltering an entire roster of useful agencies that deal with everything from industrial development and atomic energy to health care and telecommunications. And. what is probably the most important point, every September, this very Hall turned into a meeting place of all those who otherwise might not have had anywhere else to meet.\nToday, it may appear as though the dark periods of the Organisation's activity are over, as though its renovation is only a matter of capturing the spirit of the times and introducing several organisational improvements.\nAnd, true enough! the situation today is better than any of us would have dared to anticipate only a short time ago. We have seen an end to the ideological confrontation that blocked a realistic view of matters. The East-West conflict, which for 40 years threatened general destruction, in effect resolved itself, once the ideology that supported it crumbled, fully demonstrating its impotence. The interests of humanity have once again become a well-recognized priority. The collapse of bipolarity revives our renewed appreciation of multilaterality. Two years ago, the Secretary-General correctly observed that\n\\\"the United Nations has been intensely involved in activities to bring peace to troubled regions of the world. ... Indeed, the assistance of the world Organization is being sought as never before in its history.\\\" (A/44/1, p.3)\nNo longer does one third of mankind suffer the grip of a totalitarian system. Nevertheless, the Organization often seems unable to transcend the shadow of its own past. This is why it is not in the forefront of world developments, why it merely reflects, belatedly and imperfectly, these developments. This situation is all the more disturbing in view of the extent and immediacy of the Organisation's tasks.\nOne critical mission of the United Nations is to bridge the chasm between the North and the South, which is expanding menacingly. Civilisation as we know it will, at the end of this century, simply not have a chance if it is divided by enormous differences in well-being and social welfare. The collapse of an ideology is not sufficient for resolving this problem.\nEqually pressing is the solution of acute global problems that the founders of the United Nations could only dimly foresee. They are now omnipresent. They confront us in a number of areas, including the environment, energy, population and migration. We are witnessing an alarming escalation in international crime, terrorism, drug addiction and the spread of new diseases. These phenomena jeopardize not merely individuals, but also sometimes even entire nations. If the United Nations fails to react to these supra-national problems far more energetically than it has to date, it will be disqualified from dealing with critical global issues. At stake is the welfare of future generations. The Preamble to our Charter calls upon us to \\\"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\", but this is not enough at a time when civilization can self-destruct in a number of other, wholly unexpected ways.\nI propose, for example, that wherever it is possible, we consider together a strong effort to convert weapons manufacture into production benefiting the environment. The forthcoming Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil will address this problem. I believe that our Organisation should set the defence of human rights, the natural and inalienable birthright of every human being, as one of its prime objectives. It is no longer enough to have them codified or even to debate how well they are safeguarded. Those of us who experienced the gradual degeneration of so-called \\\"really existing socialism\\\" know full well that without enforcing these rights comprehensively and across the board, all else in society inevitably becomes a hollow shell, as well.\nWe also realise that the poor and the suffering will not enjoy their human rights so long as their living conditions do not radically improve. Progress in these two areas is thus interconnected. Ignoring abuses of human rights anywhere in the world is morally and politically unacceptable, as we have experienced in the distant and more recent past. We are convinced that it is not possible to argue principles of sovereignty and non-interference when the matter at issue is that of preventing ruthless, intentional and mass violations of human rights and freedoms. In fact, it is necessary to go even further in this direction. The United Nations, equipped with the appropriate authority, should stand vigilant watch over human rights everywhere in the world, and people anywhere in the world should be able to rely on its capacity to redress violations of these rights.\nAll this begs the question: Can the United Nations be better than the sum of its Members? Are we not told year after year that the Organisation cannot accomplish store than what its Member States allow? And if this were true, would we even have the right to criticise it and seek improvements? I think we will discover that more than one thread leads to better solutions within the Charter itself. Its real potential has hardly been tapped- The Charter binds all Member States to act in a manner that will allow the Organisation to accomplish its objectives successfully.\nOur world Organization must be more than the sum of its Members. Particular national interests have often been advanced, sometimes even ruthlessly, in conflict with our common interest. It should be possible to hold such conflicts within reasonable and mutually acceptable limits. Subjecting one's own interests to higher international needs is also in one's own interest. In this there should be no difference between nations big and small, developed and less developed. It is precisely the degree of mutual responsibility and tolerance that draws the line between a weak and a strong United Nations, between a paralysed Organisation and an effective one.\nA year ago the General Assembly met under the omen of the Persian Gulf War. This year we are meeting under the omen of its difficult conclusion. The end to traditional East-West rivalry has certainly contributed to the restoration of peace. In this the United Nations played an important role: it helped fight aggression and restored the rule of law. This was a serious test of whether our Organization is capable of facing a threat to international peace and security, whether it can react to naked aggression. The United Nations did not fail this test, and this is very encouraging. True, the Organization did not manage to prevent Iraqi aggression, did not find a diplomatic solution to the crisis and did not even employ the security mechanism outlined in its Charter. Nevertheless, the United Nations proceeded in the spirit of its Charter and contributed to effective cooperation between the Security Council and the peace alliance. Thus the United Nations definitely played a role in forcing the aggressor to retreat when faced by the international community.\nLast year's fears that the use of force in obtaining justice would weaken the United Nations have proved unwarranted. Moreover, once again it transpires that totalitarian and tyrannical regimes are likely to resort to war and to escalate conflicts, whereas democracies are beacons of law and peace. A clear moral follows from this: nobody who might wish to follow the Iraqi example can count on doing so with impunity. This applies also to obvious preparations for acts of aggression. Objections on the basis of sovereignty and non-interference have to be cast aside. Too much is at stake. Every Munich leads to catastrophes that are always greater than the one it seeks to prevent.\nThe moral of the Gulf war is all the more important because the Gulf is not the only area of conflict; national and ethnic conflicts are flaring up even in Europe, which earlier at least appeared to be stable.\nLast year's developments once more confirmed that justice and security are inseparable. Our common security depends upon moving towards a unity founded on generally valid principles of humanity, and this indicates the direction the United Nations should take.\nThe implementation of these principles would make it possible for the United Nations to play a more important role as an intermediary in conflicts that are of concern to us all - in Yugoslavia as well as in the Middle East. I think that the convening of a Middle East conference as well as the repealing of the resolution equating Zionism with racism would be steps in the right direction.\nThe very existence of a strong international organ can in many cases influence nations' behaviour, making it unnecessary to turn to force, which truly is the last resort. Reviewing the General Assembly agenda is sometimes a sad exercise. Year after year it stubbornly features a variety of prestigious items whose only point is to debate obsolete resolutions. Is there, for example, any point in dealing with dozens of disarmament resolutions adopted year after year in virtually unchanged form? The situation in which these issues are being resolved has fundamentally changed. Without questioning good intentions or underestimating persistent negotiating efforts, I suggest that actual results are incommensurate with the efforts and resources expended on these issues.\nThese efforts amount to little more than filling dusty archival shelves with stacks of unread printed matter. The problems I have just mentioned also touch upon United Nations activity in economic and social development. The most important phenomenon in the relationship of East and West is unquestionably the elimination of bipolarity. However, what should be truly instructive for the United Nations in the economic sphere is the absolute collapse of a system based on the idea of administrative redistribution of the property of the rich to benefit the poor.\nAnd yet to a large extent the United Nations has so far based its activity on this very idea. This idea still pervades the existing concept of a new international economic order and a host of other documents. This is a blind alley. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe know from their own experience that such a system leads at best to stagnation, but more likely it leads to general and unstoppable decay. Czechoslovakia sadly corroborates this; it ranks today among the less developed countries and, like so many others, it feels an increased and urgent need for foreign assistance. Our attitude, however, is based on the premise that no assistance can be a lasting source of riches. It can only contribute to fundamental reforms which will allow us to create our wealth ourselves.\nThat does not mean that we are insensitive to the just requirements and needs of developing countries. Despite our own difficulties, we also want to contribute to helping them as efficiently as possible. Contrary to some of my predecessors, though, I am not here to recite false data on the extent of our foreign assistance. This assistance will, for the time being, be modest. However, it will be directed far more clearly at effective development programmes within the United Nations framework and it will increase as soon as our economic circumstances permit.\nHowever, we are very concerned over shortcomings in the area of United Nations programmes. A substantial percentage of resources designated for development assistance is gobbled up by the bureaucracies of our own Organisation and of recipient countries, and too little remains for development proper. We all know about endless evaluation missions which will do anything to avoid the one important issue - an evaluation of their own uselessness. We cannot accept the existing insufficient coordination between various components of the United Nations system. We are quite baffled by the degree of their duplication - if this is indeed the right expression for not two but three or more United Nations agencies supporting separate offices in the same country, where each deals with the same problems but where, owing to the dispersion of efforts and funds nothing is actually solved.\nWe all feel the need for our Organization to adapt to the new requirements and increasing demands put on its activity. This is why changes are called for everywhere: in the composition of United Nations bodies, their mutual relationships and the way they operate, the extent of the Secretary-General's authority, the status of the Secretariat, and the financing of the United Nations.\nHowever, changes are useful only if they result in something demonstrably better. I am encouraged that some such changes are already taking place. We are determined to help them along in every possible way.\nIn particular, I have in mind the transition from propaganda duels to realistic negotiations, from mechanical vote-counting to efforts to reach a consensus. These efforts should improve conditions for using preventive diplomacy and perhaps even for accepting the idea of an arbitration court, which could become an important mechanism for solving controversies. The opinions of Member States also reflect positive changes. Me are delighted that members of the Group of 7 stressed in their July meeting in London their determination to strengthen the United Nations and to turn it into a more powerful and effective instrument of peace, international security and protection of human rights.\nOf course, we realise that it will not be easy to agree on which obstacles prevent the United Nations from working more effectively, and thus what needs to be changed. The role of the permanent members of the Security Council, for example, is one subject of discussion. We consider the principle of unanimity among Security Council permanent members a lasting one. No longer do we need to fear that ideological antagonisms will lead to a veto vote. Indeed, only now is the power of veto becoming an instrument of agreement because it forces the holders of that power to seek consensus solutions.\nHowever, a number of other changes should be undertaken immediately. The sight of Foreign Ministers day after day presenting their countries' positions on every item of the agenda to an almost empty hall is somewhat comic. It should be possible to distribute written positions beforehand and devote meetings to the problems which actually burden us. With such a procedure, everyone would gladly attend. It should be possible, for example, to merge the Special Political and the decolonization Committees of the General Assembly. We must seriously evaluate the continuing utility of other bodies which carry on stereotyped discussions and act as though the entire raison d'etre of the United Nations were concentrated in their own existence. The question of the effectiveness of the General Assembly agenda is also an absolutely pressing one, executing such changes would in itself revitalise the United Nations Charter, making it unnecessary to revise it.\nOur Organisation is approaching its fiftieth birthday. National and well-thought-out changes could create a significant revival on this anniversary.\nIn Prague last June our President, Vaclav Havel, offered some thoughts on the spirit needed to meet and shape our rapidly changing times. I believe that we could make the kinds of alterations I have been proposing in this spirit, and so, in concluding, I should like to quote Mr. Havel's remark. He said:\n\\\"In fact we are all somewhat taken by surprise by the magnitude and urgency of the task which issues from the magnitude of the hope opening up before us.\n\\\"What follows from all this? I would say two things: first, the obligation of not fearing daring, unconventional and radical decisions which lead towards the distant future and preparing for it; second, the obligation of understanding the difficult and broken terrain, at times quite risky in its opacity, on which we stand and on which we must make decisions.\\\"\n\n"

Through you, I also congratulate your Sisterly country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which Egypt has strong ties and firm bunds.\nI have full confidence that with your renowned ability and experience you will guide the deliberations of this session in a manner that will allow it to address the problems of the world in harmony with the prevailing new spirit and in a manner conducive to serious dialogue and the achievement of the desired consensus towards laying the foundations of a new world.\nI avail myself of this opportunity also to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Foreign Minister of Malta, President of the forty-fifth session of the General assembly, for his excellent conduct of that session's business. During that session, the United Nations witnessed one of the most productive periods in its work in terms both of performance and achievement.\nWith the accession of new Members to the membership of the United Nations, our Organization has taken another important step on the road to universality, a goal we have all striven for since the Organization's establishment. It is with hope and optimism that we look forward to the contributions and positive participation of the new Members, which will undoubtedly enrich our collective work. From this rostrum, the delegation of Egypt would like to express its warmest congratulations to all these States.\nThis year's session is being held at a time when the international Organization has reached the middle of its fifth decade. During that time, it has witnessed moments of victory and moments of defeat. It has seen moments when the great hopes of the vision of a new secure world have been realized. It has also lived through moments of frustration and repeated failure to attain the noble objectives of the United Nations Charter, which were consecrated as a basis for a new life for peoples and nations. In the lives of peoples and nations there are moments and events which constitute decisive turning-points. He may fall to grasp the essence of such events because of their overwhelming magnitude. What has happened, and continues to happen, in our international life from not long ago until now represents, by any objective criterion, the emergence of a new pattern of relations which will undoubtedly reflect upon the work, structure and performance of the United Nations.\nThe world we see today is moving closer to that great vision of the founding Members, to that vision of the peoples of the United Nations when they declared their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.\nThe report the Secretary-General presented to this session reinforces our faith in the potential and ability of the United Nations system to move the world to new levels of peace, stability and security for all, to take the world to a stage where it would reaffirm, through the United Nations, the provisions of the Charter - probably for the first time in its history - by using the machinery of collective security to deter aggression and to restore international peace and security, thus allowing the United Nations to be a model and provide terms of reference for us all in our adherence to international legitimacy in all situations and in all conflicts, whatever their locations and their backgrounds may be.\nThe peoples and nations have paid a heavy price over 50 years of trial and effort to ensure that the vision expressed by the founding Members in San Francisco was not an unrealistic dream but rather an achievable, legitimate human wish. The only things that prevented that vision from coming into being were the chains and shackles which reined in the freedoms of the individual and the peoples. Those bonds chained human creative abilities. In a few months, the thought, the practice and the very systems of totalitarianism collapsed. The waves of intellectual, political and economic freedom are on the rise, and racist regimes and discriminatory practices shall retreat so that development may prevail among peoples in every corner of our planet.\nEgypt, that ancient country as old as history itself, which saw the dawn of human civilization and on whose land the creative energy of mankind was first released, early sensed the winds of change. It was among the first States to foresee the new changes and, in fact, to predict and contribute to them. As a founding member of the world order in which we live today, Egypt will contribute, with an open mind and an enlightened sense of history, to the establishment of the new world. Egypt will do so just as it contributed, during the decades of its leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement, to the search for a world free of the cold war and of polarization and division, a world in which the freedoms of individuals and peoples would reign supreme.\nThe world we envisage through the eyes of our age-old civilization and our modern-day hopes is a world in which democracy and human rights would prevail, a world based on the equality of rights and responsibilities and on equal participation in decision-making. The new order for which we are working is not the sole responsibility of any one State or group of States. Rather, it is the responsibility of one and all. North and South, East and West, and must be to the benefit of all and protect the rights of all.\nThis, in our opinion, necessitates that the peoples and the States of the world take their stand on the right side of history: a stand on the side of justice, legitimacy and the rule of law, which are indispensable for laying\nthe foundations of peace security and stability. The reawakening which we are witnessing in the world around us strongly expresses the aspirations of peoples to assert their identities and to exercise their national rights, and the search for new standards in political life that would achieve what is right and just for all peoples without distinction or discrimination. Human rights and the rights of peoples transcend colour, race, and religious belief. They are not the monopoly of a certain nation nor are they the exclusive property of any one people. This is precisely what should be the meaning of the new world order whose features are evolving.\nThe practical expression of this reawakening lies in a concerted international effort to lay the foundations of peace in places where it has not yet been achieved; in the Middle East, South Africa, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Western Sahara, Cambodia and other areas of tension. Fortunately, persistent efforts are being exerted towards achieving settlements.\nThe Middle East has witnessed during the last few months and continues to witness persistent and serious efforts to advance the peace process from the stage of consultation to that of negotiation. There is no doubt that this is a sensitive stage: it needs patience, vision, and the ability to overcome obstacles, eliminate hurdles and dispel doubts. Moreover, it requires that all demonstrate sincere political will and good faith, which will chart a course and allow freedom of action. It is important to me, in this regard, to commend the initiative of the United States, launched by President Bush, to convene a Middle East peace conference, in the framework of which direct negotiations would be held on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the principle of land for peace.\nWith the recent major International developments, the Arab-Israeli conflict, with the Palestinian question at its core, has entered a new phase. The world is moving towards the settlement of disputes through dialogue and negotiation based on respect for international legitimacy, the principles of international law and the provisions of the Charter. The world is also showing greater respect for the will of peoples which yearn for freedom, independence.\nIn this regard, Egypt considers the recent decisions of the Palestinian National Council an important step on the road to peace. They constitute a positive contribution by the representative of the Palestinian people to the current peace process. The importance of such a contribution is very clear in view of the Palestinians' being a principal party in that process.\nWe aspire to create a favourable climate free from threats to the future of the settlement of the conflict. In all honesty and with a sense of responsibility, we affirm that the continuation of or the persistence in undertaking measures that destroy confidence and sow despair will only lead to a continuation of the vicious circle for years to come, hence exacerbating the causes of instability. During such a period the causes of instability will be further exacerbated. The whole Middle East will thus continue to be a hotbed of perpetual tension and confrontation.\nHence, persistence in the policy and practice of the constructing settlements in the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, including Al-Quds and the Golan Heights, has a negative effect on the prospects for peace, as it attempts to entrench an illegal fait accompli that constitutes a violation of law and legitimacy.\nIsrael's persistence in pursuing its settlement policies will result in a shattering of the principle of \\\"land for peace\\\", as well as violating the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), thus undermining international legitimacy. President Hosni Mubarak's initiative called for a halt in the building of settlements in exchange for a halt of the Arab economic boycott measures. This initiative still stands, and today I reaffirm it.\nSincere progress towards peace would necessitate, first and foremost, the immediate cessation of these policies and practices and the undertaking of measures that would restore the shaken confidence of all parties, so that the peace process can start in a favourable atmosphere. We have reached a decisive moment that now requires firm political will and courage. He call upon all to back the convening of the peace conference and the negotiations that will take place in its framework. We urge all to support the principle of \\\"land for peace\\\", and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the security of all parties.\nThe will of the world, which backed, defended and imposed international legitimacy during the Gulf crisis, is called upon to fully understand all the dimensions of the situation in the Middle East in order to place it in its proper perspective within the context of the movement of today's world towards justice and legitimacy.\nWe have drawn many lessons from the Gulf crisis, not the least of which is that economic interdependence is closely linked to security interdependence and that security should be taken seriously in the context of global and regional legitimacy. On this premise, eight Arab countries have agreed, in the framework of the Damascus Declaration, on a specific mutual-security\narrangement among the Gulf States, Egypt and Syria. This arrangement is based on the instruments of joint Arab action and aims to lay the foundations of security on a cherished part of Arab land, on new bases of consensus and understanding, and on the firm determination to prevent the recurrence of what happened when Iraq invaded Kuwait. This grave error, which was a blow to the Arab system, also had serious repercussions on the international system. In this context, we reaffirm that the security of the Gulf region is part of Arab security, and that Arab security is part of international security.\nIt is imperative to affirm and uphold the integration and interdependence of regional and international legitimacies. Today's world is different from that of yesterday. It is actively on the march towards new wider and developing horizons. It is impossible, while this is the case, for a particular region to remain cocooned and to continue marching at a different pace, or to be isolated from world reality, burying its head in the sand, believing that it can remain secure from accountability and questioning.\n\nOn the other hand, the issue of security is closely linked with that of arms control and disarmament. This is a global endeavour with regional dimensions. As to the Middle East, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction is of prime importance. In this context, I reaffirm Egypt's initiative, declared by President Hosni Mubarak, for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, and especially nuclear weapons, from the region.\nThe elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the ideal formula for the security of the whole region, cannot be achieved but through an integrated, comprehensive framework applicable to all without exception or distinction. Such a framework must correct imbalances and eliminate quantitative and qualitative differences.\nWe are aware that historic successes in the field of disarmament were not achieved until the political environment was changed. Confrontation has been turned into dialogue, conflict into cooperation and suspicion into trust. Our region has its specific characteristics and its own political reality, which we cannot overlook but ought to change with responsible action by all parties without exception. The first such responsible action, which will constitute a sound step towards confidence-building, is the accession by Israel to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the full placing of all her nuclear installations under a safeguard regime.\nThe historic step, declared by President Bush a few days ago, of the United States' decision to relinquish her short-range nuclear weapons deserves our appreciation and welcome, both for its significance and for its far-reaching effects on efforts for arms control and disarmament, as well as for the strong impetus it gives to the new world order. Egypt feels satisfied that this initiative is receiving positive responses on the international level, and hopes that it may generate positive reaction on the regional level as well, with respect to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in such areas of conflict as the Middle East.\nThe success and effectiveness of our Organization in laying the foundations of political settlements in Africa, Asia, Central America and even Europe were based on historic reconciliation between the parties, founded upon respect for the principles of international law, human rights, democracy, dialogue, negotiation, accommodation, and the utilization of the means of peaceful settlement of disputes- We cannot overlook the fact that the settlement of these disputes evolved, in no small measure, from the emergence of healthy democratic practices and the elimination of the odious differences resulting from racial discrimination. In this respect, we call upon South Africa to abolish, totally and unequivocally, apartheid and all its pillars, so that healthy and proper relations be established with South Africa and the international community may consider lifting the sanctions imposed upon the country.\nIf we truly wish to lay equitable foundations for tomorrow's world, the international community is called upon today to carry out a comprehensive review - conducted in a spirit of realism, dialogue, and shared responsibility - of international economic conditions. There is a need for a coordinated collective effort to arrive at a general framework for macroeconomic policies to restore balanced growth to the world economy and to revitalize development in the developing countries. The aim must be to ensure the full and active participation of the third world as a full partner, with equal rights and responsibilities, in the establishment of the new world order.\nIn order to achieve this, we must not lose sight of certain fundamental considerations. First, Africa, which constitutes a quarter of the world's land mass and whose population will represent one fifth of the world population by the end of this century, is facing an extremely serious situation, the consequences of which will go beyond the continent itself. History will not absolve us if we enter the twenty-first century with a continent of such great potential as Africa continuing to languish under the burdens of backwardness and poverty, with millions of its children dying of hunger and malnutrition. However prosperous some parts of our world may be, it will remain a poor world as long as Africa and other parts remain poor.\nIt is our hope that a full sense of this responsibility will be reflected in our review and appraisal of the United Rations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development during this session. The Secretary-General's report provides a good basis for action in this regard. With the help of the data, information and suggestions it contains, we hope it will be possible to arrive at viable solutions that will enable Africa to embark on the road leading out of the abyss of underdevelopment and poverty.\nSecondly, the international economic system is going to witness major changes emerging from the formation of large economic groupings in the North and the modest attempts at building regional economic groupings in the South, in addition to the dramatic changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the largest part of the third world languishes under the burden of debt. It lacks technical and financial resources. It suffers from the imbalance of economic structures and from social disturbances, the deterioration of the rates of development, and the unjust terms of international trade. All this makes the world market as a whole more fragile. A biased view of the world economy threatens the onset of imbalances, the dangerous potential consequences of which make it incumbent upon the international community as a whole to show political will and adopt responsible economic policies to cure its ailing sections and save the healthy parts from infection.\nThirdly, human rights have become a basic issue on the international agenda. There is no disagreement today between developing and developed countries on the need for respect for human rights both domestically and internationally or on the obligation of States to ensure the basic freedoms of the individual, regardless of country of origin, race, religious faith or political affiliation. Yet human rights cannot be addressed in isolation from people's daily living conditions. This brings to the fore the direct link between human rights and socio-economic development. A balance must be struck between these two sides of the equation in a context encompassing international relations as a whole.\nFourthly, the problems of the environment, which are of global dimensions, should be solved through international cooperation within a balanced framework that takes into account the requirements of development in the developing countries and ensures that any measures to protect the global environment support the socio-economic development process of the developing countries. We hope that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, will mark the beginning of a comprehensive international effort and a joint programme of action for the protection of the environment and the achievement of development.\nThe achievement of development in all its dimensions would be incomplete without adequate attention to human development, primarily in the field of child care and the implementation of the Universal Declaration of the World Summit for Children.\nIf the new world order is to achieve political and economic stability, it must be founded upon close interaction between the developing world on the one hand, with its capabilities, potentials, resources, and rich historical heritage, and the developed world on the other, with all its achievements, contributions, experience and major scientific endeavours. This interaction must be a balanced and equal process in which the development of both sides goes hand in hand, their steps are harmonized, and their interests equally guaranteed.\nFrom this perspective, based on the interdependence and integration of international relations, Egypt submits its approach towards a framework relating to the developed and developing world in terms of their objectives, issues and interests. First, Egypt calls for the establishment of a common forum that would group under its aegis the Non-Aligned Movement and all the developing countries, known as the Group of 77, for their commonality of interest and the closeness of their objectives and priorities. This forum would represent a new unified movement for all the nations of the world in the emerging order of this last decade of the twentieth Century.\nSecondly, Egypt calls for genuine concrete support for the United Nations in the new international relations through the enhancement of its operational effectiveness and the development of its mechanisms as instruments for the maintenance of international peace and security, and for the implementation of its resolutions, which all represent international legitimacy.\nThirdly, Egypt reaffirms the close inter linkage and interdependence of regional and global security in all cases of stability or tension. Geography is no longer a principal factor of security. It no longer distances regions or ensures the inviolability of States. Sheer power in the hands of a few does not guarantee peace for all.\nThe new order dawning upon our modern era will not be one whose parts are estranged or alienated, but rather a world whose regions - be they large or small, developed or developing - will come closer together in a framework of deeper relations, integrated security systems, comprehensive peace, equal justice, balanced and sustained development. If our determination is strong and sincere, the new world order will mark the beginning of a new history for mankind. And a new beginning it must be.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, on behalf of the Government and the people of New Zealand let me first congratulate you on your election. It has certainly been a momentous year both for you and for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nI should like also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who has worked tirelessly over the past 10 years towards the reduction of tension throughout the world. As he comes to the end of a decade of service I offer to the Secretary-General my congratulations, and those of the Government and the people of New Zealand on his personal contribution to the cause of peace.\nI am delighted to join you, Sir, in welcoming new Members to this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In particular I want to welcome the Federated States of Micronesia - a new member of this body, but a familiar friend to my country as host of the most recent meeting of South Pacific Forum nations. I am delighted that they and their close neighbours, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, are joining us at this time.\nIt is a source of immense satisfaction that we see here today for the first time the legitimate representatives of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of these three European nations that have struggled against totalitarian rule for so long. Their international recognition as independent sovereign States brings to an end a chapter in their history when they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.\nTheir independence and membership of this Organisation coupled with the membership of the Republic of Korea, which I warmly welcome, and the membership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea signal the end of an era, or more importantly the beginning of a new era, in international relations.\nNew opportunities in politics and trade command our attention. New problems constantly challenge our capabilities. In Yugoslavia, we see a situation that cries out for peaceful resolution. Mediation has been tried. It must be tried again. It will never be successful unless and until the parties to the conflict are prepared to commit themselves fully to the process. So my Government appeals to all other members of the international community that might have some influence - direct or indirect - to use that Influence to persuade the parties to the conflict to commit themselves to mediation if they cannot resolve their differences peacefully on their own.\nToday the problems may look intractable but difficult issues can be solved. Already the change in global politics has been rewarded by significant progress in the field of disarmament. The super-Powers have committed themselves to substantial reductions in their arsenals of nuclear weapons. While the world warmly welcomes each new step in the reduction of nuclear weapons agreed to by the super-Powers, this progress is undermined by the actual or potential proliferation of nuclear weapons to other nations. Therefore on arms control nothing is more important than moves to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nNew Zealand, as one of the first nations to sign and ratify the United Nations Non-Proliferation Treaty, firmly believes that attempts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons must be an agenda item of the highest priority for the Organisation. The dangers from nuclear weapons are such that a failure to halt their proliferation would seriously diminish the recent success in strategic arms reductions.\nWe welcome the decisions of France and the people's Republic of China to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now that the Treaty will cover all the current nuclear Powers of the world. New Zealand urges all parties to agree to its indefinite extension in 1995.\nIn singling out nuclear weapons for particular attention, I do not in any way diminish the work needed to control other weapons of mass destruction, such as those using chemical or biological agents.\nThe importance of the task of stopping the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction should be firmly embedded in the minds of thinking people everywhere following the fearful possibility that Saddam Hussein would use such weapons during his illegal take-over of the State of Kuwait. That act of aggression tested the strength and commitment of this world body.\n\nWe can all take pride in the fact that the leadership shown by the United Nations in the exercise of its undoubted moral authority was successful in facilitating the coming together of a great coalition of nations who were determined that the might of Saddam Hussein would not succeed and that Kuwait would be restored to its independent sovereign status. During the dangerous weeks of the Gulf crisis the United Nations, with strong leadership from the Security Council, showed firmness of judgment and a commitment to the ideals of the United Nations that has reinforced the status and authority of this Organisation. The Security Council was able to reflect accurately the mood of the General Assembly because of its broad representation aerobe regional lines and its inclusion of the small and vulnerable as well as the large and powerful.\nI want to pay a warm tribute to Kuwait's Arab neighbours, who were resolute in their support of the rights of a small independent nation and refused to back down to intimidation or threats. Their steadfastness in the early stages of the crisis was a major reason why Kuwait was eventually liberated.\nThe role of the United States in bringing together the coalition of nations who worked in concert to liberate Kuwait was an impressive display of international diplomacy. United States forces, with their British, French and Arab counterparts, gave an equally impressive display on the ground and in the air. But overriding the achievements of the individual nations was the commitment given by nations, large and small, to the military task force that gathered to halt aggression and to guarantee the independent sovereign rights of the small nation, Kuwait. I am proud that my country played a small part in that coalition and has been able to contribute to the post-war United Nations commissions, such as that on the disposal of weapons of mass destruction.\nAs a small country in the south-west Pacific, we do not threaten anyone, nor do we peek to impose our will on other countries. But in joining the coalition we honoured a New Zealand tradition to oppose tyranny and support freedom. Luckier than a number, all our military personnel came home safely on this occasion, but many of their forebears in pursuit of the same goals rest alongside the battlefields of the modern world. We have never shirked our responsibilities.\nAs we opposed a dictator in the Gulf, freedom-loving people around the world have rejoiced as we have witnessed, too, the collapse of totalitarian communism in Europe. That system was defeated not by force of arms but by ordinary people, in their hundreds of thousands, reaching in the streets to reclaim their God-given right to freedom of thought, expression and assembly and their right to democratic government. It has been a glorious victory for the indomitable spirit of the human person.\nBut let me sound a note of warning: this impressive victory could turn to bitterness, and hope to despair, unless all nations show equal courage in addressing an equally unprecedented economic challenge. The helping hand that both the emerging democracies of Europe and the developing countries of the world need most is the hand of trade. So, today, the barricades we must pull down are not those erected to prevent tanks but those erected to hinder trade.\nTo sustain and secure the dramatic political changes that have occurred, to deny dictators the excuse for coveting others' territory, to ease the\ncrushing debt burdens that too many countries face, to provide an economic alternative to the destruction of our environment - to do all these things, and more, we have to realise that a change in the international trading system is essential. Without change, how can the new democracies in Europe do what they want to do for their people if their exports face restrictions in foreign markets? How can debt-ridden developing nations ever pay their way if they face not only similar restrictions but subsidised competition too?\nThis is not a debate that can be drawn wholly across North-South lines, because trade restrictions occur on both sides, as does subsidisation. This is a debate about giving meaning to the many fine words, about helping those who are struggling to escape poverty, and about securing the democratic freedoms so recently won. This is a debate about complementing aid with trade.\nThe Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations began nearly five years ago. It was, and remains, the moat ambitious of all the trade negotiating rounds. Yet it is in real danger of faltering if the political commitments that were given in 1986, and have been repeated since then - moat recently at the G-7 meeting this year - are not translated into the substantive decisions that are already overdue.\nA country like mine, dependent on trade for its very livelihood, finds it incredible that political and economic leaders who are responsible in so many things, who are participating in, and encouraging, the dawn of a new political era, have not yet broken the log-jam in the negotiations. Certainly the G-7 group of industrialised countries, under the chairmanship of the British Prime Minister, gave us cause for new hope. Certainly the United States has been, and remains, a strong proponent of a liberalised international trading system. Thoughtful leaders In the European Community, and many leaders in the developing world, have all called for greater progress.\nBut it seems to be a case of words, words and more words, but little action. If we are to succeed, action must now take the place of words. Time is running out. The alternative to a successful and substantive conclusion to the Uruguay Round is often said to be a series of trade blocs - groups of countries turning in on themselves, failing to realise their full competitive advantage) surviving, perhaps, but at a lower and more unstable level than would be possible in a liberal world trading system.\nAll this is quite possible, but I suggest that it is not the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is those countries that have found new freedoms having those freedoms taken away by regimes who use the excuse of the need for economic control of disintegrating economies as a cover for political oppression; it is having stable countries being made less stable because they cannot earn the foreign exchange necessary to provide for the legitimate aspirations of their people; it is turning the clock back rather than forward.\nWith a view to avoiding that - and avoid it we must - I make a plea from this rostrum that the barricades that prevent fair trade be taken down. And if the powerful will not do it to help the weak, then they should do it for the selfish reason that it is the only way the world will secure a lasting peace. Trade between nations is what breaks down fear, and the sharing of resources by trade is what prevents ware of acquisition. If the selfish win, if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade fails, then today's leaders will have planted the seed of future conflicts. That is a strong message, but it is no more so than the seriousness of the situation warrants. \nLet us achieve a milestone in the progress of international trade this year, so that we can move forward with confidence to the United Nations Conference on Environment, and Development next year. A free and fair trade system is central to our efforts to conserve and enhance the environment. We have already made progress on issues such as driftnet fishing and with the Montreal Osona Protocol) but we need to maximise these gains by ensuring that States fully observe the measures that have been adopted in such fields. Next year's United Nations Conference in Brazil will be the real test of our ability to cooperate in the endeavour to find the proper balance between development and environmental protection. My country is the first anywhere to enshrine the concept of sustainable development in legislation on natural resources.\nJust before I departed from New Zealand seven students from seven continents of the world lit a candle for peace in front of Maori tukutuku panels symbolising the seeking of knowledge. They were greeting the dawning of this new session of the United Nations General Assembly. The students participated in this ceremony in New Zealand because ours is one of the first countries to see the sun rise, and a ceremony at dawn is the traditional Maori way to acknowledge a new beginning.\nWe in this Assembly can all rejoice in that we are seeing new beginnings in many parts of the world: in Europe, in Cambodia, in South Africa. We must not let this moment in history pass; we must now replace an understanding of how to destroy each other with a new understanding of how to live and trade with each other. It is my most fervent hope and prayer that this great assembly of nations has the moral courage to do not only what is necessary but what is right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn addressing this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, I should like first of all to express the respect and very high esteem felt by the people of Sao Tome and Principe towards this noble Organisation, whose activities attest to the importance of its role in the search for understanding between peoples in order to safeguard peace between nations.\nAllow me, Sir, to convey to you my congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session and to take this opportunity to wish you every success in carrying out your work. My delegation is convinced that your experience and your great qualities are the surest gauge of that success. Over and above your personal qualities, this choice is also an expression of our community's recognition of the increasing role your country, Saudi Arabia, is constantly playing both in the Middle East and internationally.\nI now turn to the Secretary-General, to convey to him the tribute of the people of Sao Tome and Principe and to tell him how much admiration and esteem we have for the work he has carried out over his 10 years at the helm of the biggest and most prestigious of international organizations. He has been able to steer this frail craft with persistence, courage and firmness towards less hazardous shores by avoiding, with the wisdom and lightness of touch all recognize in him, the perils that lay along its course. We are grateful to him for this.\nWe particularly welcome the return of the three Baltic republics into our community; in this act of justice they have regained their rights. Our warmest congratulations go also to the Marshall Islands and to Micronesia. We greet the two States of the Korean people here present in the wish that this forum will provide them with a setting and an additional opportunity for dialogue and concertation which may bring about rapid progress along their converging paths towards the reunification of their homeland.\nIndeed, we set great store by dialogue and concertation as the instruments of choice in the quest for peace, as much within States are in the relations between them. That is why we are so very pleased at seeing peace covering even more of the world, whether at the national level - and here we cannot but pay a resounding tribute to our Angolan brothers for their courage and wisdom in negotiating and signing a peace agreement, or at the regional level - and here we are referring to the forthcoming international conference on the Middle East, at which we hope to see the national rights and legitimate interests of all the States and peoples concerned prevail, including, of course, those of the State of Israel and the Palestinian people.\nMay the spirit of peace guide those parties which are still in conflict, in Mozambique as in Cambodia, in Yugoslavia as in Liberia, in El Salvador as in the Sudan.\nWe hail the imminent referendum in Western Sahara, in which the Sahraoui people will have an opportunity to express their views freely on their political future.\nWe deeply regret the fact that such an opportunity has not yet been given to the people of East Timor, who went straight from being colonized to being occupied in the aftermath of a foreign invasion. We hope that the international community, which was capable of reacting promptly in Kuwait to uphold the law, will be capable of finding a formula that will also enable the Maubere people to exercise their sacred right to self-determination.\nStill within the context of eliminating hotbeds of tension within national boundaries, we cannot but mention the positive developments in the situation in South Africa. For quite a while now, the country has been experiencing major changes in respect of its apartheid policy. The main pillars of this aberrant system have been dismantled, and the dynamic of negotiation thus seems to be gaining the upper hand over the destructive logic of violent confrontation. We congratulate all the parties involved in this process, and urge them strongly to continue down the path of dialogue with a view to successfully defining an institutional framework capable of guaranteeing peaceful national coexistence. It is our dearest hope that this great African nation will soon occupy the pole position which it should hold within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and which will remain empty so long as the country is not totally wiped clean of some lingering after effects, racial discrimination in other guises, which prevent it from proclaiming the equality of its citizens before the law with all that that entails.\nThis general trend towards the elimination of hotbeds of tension throughout the world is perfectly consistent with the trend towards universal detente, which has not faltered over the last few years and has given mankind fresh cause for hope. The conflicts which are occurring here and there, stemming from certain specific local causes, do not seem to us capable of long withstanding the spirit of detente prevailing in relations between the great countries.\nAccordingly, we are witnessing movements towards dismantling a number of conventional and nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction, which, first, is very reassuring, and, secondly, enables us to dream of the extraordinary progress which could be achieved in the field of economic, scientific and human development if some of the resources which were formerly allocated to these weapons could be used to meet the needs of the least developed countries. However, to do this, perhaps a greater awareness is needed of the community of interests which binds the rich countries to the poor in the face of the common destiny they seem ineluctable to share.\nAt the moment when to our great regret the Secretary-General is taking leave of his office, he has given us, with that upright honesty that is the prerogative of truly free spirits, his reflections on the state of Africa at the end of five years of the special Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which was approved in January 1986. He paints an objective picture which, we have to admit, is far from encouraging; it is, in fact, an acknowledgment of failure. Moreover, what else could it have been, when the inequalities in the terms of trade, which go against the African countries, only render the efforts some of those countries have courageously undertaken to diversify and increase production more and more pointless? What else could it have been, when the direction of the financial flows, owing in particular to debt service payments, is, as we all know, from Africa onwards? It is true, by this logic that Africa will continue to get poorer. But is this inevitable? Frankly, we do not think so.\nAfrica, as others have said before and as others will be able to say better than us, harbours the human and natural resources needed for advancement. But it is still necessary for parameters such as justice and solidarity to form part of the economic dimension of international relations. It is necessary for the fluctuating, temporary interests of States to give way to the permanent interests of peoples, enduring interests.\nJustice and solidarity: these two words are the true keys to the much-desired peace that we have spoken of, words without which nothing lasting can be built. Justice, because poverty, unlike wealth, has a tolerance threshold. If inequality pushes people to the extreme limit of what can be borne, the social explosion becomes inevitable, and no one can predict the consequences of the revolt of a people unleashed when they have nothing to lose because they have nothing to defend. And in this chapter of economic inequality and social injustice, what is true for one country is also true for a continent.\nIndeed, it is difficult for us, with all the means of communication and exchange that we have today and that continue to develop at a rapid pace, to conceive of a peaceful coexistence in the community of nations between a few opulent oases of prosperity in the middle of a vast desert of poverty, poverty that grows more and more acute. In these circumstances, there appears on the horizon a danger which must absolutely be prevented.\nThe answer lies in solidarity - not philanthropic solidarity, dictated only by the whims of the heart and confused with charity, but solidarity based on the rightness of reason. That alone can save us. Not to acknowledge this is to be an ostrich, and it does no good to hide one's head, because reality is stubborn. The danger that can fall upon us from the sky, whether it be from the holes in the some layer or from the clouds of Chernobyl, makes no distinction between men or between countries. When the Indian in the distant Amazon forest cuts down a tree, when an African farmer burns his fields in order to prepare the land for his crops, somewhere, thousands of kilometres away, someone breathes less easily; hence the great crusade for the preservation of nature and the defence of the environment, which we enthusiastically support.\nWe are pleased with the initiative to hold the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is scheduled for next year in Brazil. Environment and development: here we are on the right path towards the necessary awareness of the conception, programming and implementation of the mechanisms leading to the materialization of more active solidarity between the rich countries of the North and the poor countries of the South. As long as our people have at their disposition no resources other than wood to cook their food and build their houses, as long as they have no access to less archaic technology - let us not deceive ourselves - trees will continue to be felled and fields to be burned.\nIt is our fear that, in the development of solidarity, Africa will once again be forgotten. The systematic marginalization of our continent has led some people to develop pessimistically inclined philosophical concepts, which we consider negative.\nSao Tome and Principe is a very small country, forgotten among the forgotten. It is small geographically and demographically but great in its will to succeed, trying, within the constraints of its enormously limited financial, natural and human resources, to make the necessary effort and sacrifices.\nOf course, Sao Tome and Principe's small size and lack of major resources are a great handicap, because we have no way of attracting the attention of the world's decision makers. However, this may be an advantage, because cooperation with Sao Tome and Principe is available to any developed country. Assistance, however insignificant it might seem, is in itself meaningful for a small country. Something at a cost that would seem laughable to others could have a positive impact on the conditions in which the people of Sao Tome and Principe live.\nThese effects can be immediate and visible to the naked eye. But one might wonder why this small country is still in the same situation today. The reasons are, in general, sufficiently well known. Some are directly or indirectly attributable to us, while others are not.\nAs for the former, we rose up in victorious battle against a monolithic regime that constricted individual freedom and brought with it the defects of totalitarianism, in contempt of human values and fundamental rights.\nOur victory has been manifested, following a difficult, persistent, but peaceful struggle, in the restoration of a democratic, pluralistic regime in Sao Tome and Principe. Whether on the occasion of the ratification of the democratic Constitution by popular referendum on 22 August 1990, or in the legislative elections on 20 January 1991 or in the presidential election held on 3 March of the same year, the people of Sao Tome and Principe determinedly chose change, with order and calm. It is true: our democratic transition succeeded, our people displayed a lofty civic sense and the institutions that resulted from the new legal and constitutional framework were established and are operating smoothly.\nThe multiparty system that is now part of our national political landscape is starting to become familiar to us. Our former leaders retain\ntheir preserve - they have their rightful place in society. The small family that is the people of Sao Tome and Principe could now finally be reconciled with its traditions of joy, brotherhood, and serenity if the economic and financial situation of the country were not so disastrous.\nIn order to try to remedy this situation, the new democratic regime has resumed negotiations with the Bretton Hoods institutions with a view to revitalizing the structural adjustment programme, which was suspended because of the former regime's lack of respect for the commitments it had undertaken. A series of measures adopted last May in order to reduce our (macroeconomic distortions did not produce the desired results. Therefore, a new package of more-binding measures has just been applied. The Government has thus displayed its determination to deal with the real problems and its will to cooperate with international financial institutions and the international community as a whole.\nAs for the people of Sao Tome and Principe, whose purchasing power shrinks year by year, they are having a great deal of difficulty tolerating the impact of the two devaluations, of 22.5 per cent and 40 per cent, in the space of three and a half months, a 275 per cent increase in the price of fuel, a two-thirds reduction in the budgetary deficit from one year to the next, salary freezes - all this in a context of price truthfulness, which is appropriate to a market economy.\nWe know that the country must pursue a policy of strict economic and financial management and that, in order to do so, certain stabilising treasures must be undertaken. But we also know that without a sustained effort in the economy's production sector, there can be no viable stability. That is why we wish to launch from this rostrum a sincere and formal appeal to the international community to support the efforts and sacrifices of the people of Sao Tome and Principe in its very unequal struggle against poverty, suffering and misery. We need support in the elaboration and financing of small projects in the field of infrastructure and production; support in the training of national cadres, without which it is difficult to ensure development; and immediate support in creating the conditions necessary to mitigate the social consequences of structural adjustment, which are unduly harsh for some segments of the population - women, children and the elderly in particular.\nThirty years ago, I came to the United Nations as a nationalist leader and a petitioner. I was allowed to describe before the Fourth Committee of -he General Assembly the situation of the people of Sao Tome and Principe, which had suffered under the colonial yoke for five centuries.\nIn 1975, the year my country acceded to independence and became a State Member of the United Nations, I had the great privilege as Head of Government of thanking the community of nations, from this very rostrum, for its support of our liberation struggle and of requesting at the same time its generous assistance for the work of national reconstruction that we were about to undertake.\nToday, it is my great honour to return here, as my country's first democratically elected Head of State, to plead for support for democracy and respect for the values of human rights in which we firmly believe. The democracy we have freely chosen and established is still fragile, and our legal structures are embryonic. They must be supported and strengthened. The only danger threatening them at this time - and it is a major one - is the economic and financial situation of the country and its inability to cope, through its own means, with the people's extreme poverty.\nIf we do not succeed in solving these problems - and that is possible only with the help of the international community - we fear that the democratic achievements of Sao Tome and Principe will be jeopardized. It would be disastrous for our people and others if the unrest which has arisen elsewhere in favour of democracy were to occur in Sao Tome and Principe against it.\nWe retain the hope that this will not be the case, because we know that we, a country committed to freedom, peace and justice, will never allow hunger to smother hope.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish first of all to convey to Mr. Samir Shihabl my congratulations on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this most important session.\nExcept for those concerning 1960, one can hardly find in the records of the United Nations an event of the kind we witnessed last week; namely, the simultaneous admission to membership of seven additional States. It confirms without doubt the universal vocation of our Organisation or, more precisely, that singular openness which enables the United Nations to be in tune with what is going on in the world. Assessing the significance of such an event, we should stress equally that, by seeking recognition as Members of the United Nations, the recently admitted States, like others that are still waiting for recognition, offer the most convincing proof that the United Nations is increasingly perceived as a privileged framework for the achievement of a peaceful and democratic world order.\nSuch encouraging evidence that the United Nations, in regard to its role in world affairs, has not lost the functions entrusted to it in the aftermath of the Second World War should serve as a catalyst for our common endeavour to improve its efficiency.\nBefore elaborating on this, I should like to extend to the representatives of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and our fellow European countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - as well as to the representatives of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands our greetings on their admission as full members of the United Nations family. At the same time, I should like to share with all the representatives gathered in this Hall our hope that in the near future the newly independent States which have asked, or are going to ask, to be allowed to join the world Organization will also enjoy the right to be among us.\nThe fact that some of the new Members have only recently won their independence and international recognition, on the one hand, and the fact that we have agreed to accept two States representing one and the same nation, on the other, encourages us to believe that in a reasonable span of time the Republic of Moldova will, in its turn, benefit from legitimate recognition as a Member of the United Nations.\nWe are strengthened in our belief by the evidence that double standards are on the wane in our Organisation. Today, when the divisions of the cold war have started to be replaced by a growing endeavour to bring about a new world order, it is only natural that such double standards should not be allowed to become manifest in connection with admission to the United Nations - the more so because abandoning double standards is not only a high priority but also a tangible possibility.\nThe Gulf crisis clearly demonstrated that the United Nations is no longer the prisoner of the ideological confrontation that resulted in too many of its resolutions, even some of those adopted by the Security Council, failing to be implemented during the last four decades.\nSince the end of 1989 the world and, together with it, the United Nations have entered a new phase in their history. The conceptual field itself suggests that times are changing. Notions directly or indirectly connected to the cold-war Manichean language are already well behind us. Some others - such as neutrality and non-alignment - seem to need new definitions. New notions - and the concept of a new world order is the best example - have become part of our daily political language.\nIt goes without saying, therefore, that the new climate does not offer solutions to the many problems the world of the 1990s is confronted with. None the lees, it has created a more favourable international political environment for cooperation and understanding. The challenge before us is to bring about, in each and every field of human activity, proper conditions for improvement of the human condition all over the world.\nI feel the need to recall for representatives at this session of the General Assembly how strongly attached to the cause of peace and civilisation my country has been throughout its tortuous history. Its Latin identity, its Christian religion and its vocation for tolerance - a sine qua non of democracy - have been the mainspring of its unabated attachment to those supreme ends of human endeavour.\nSituated, by the will of God, at the crossroads not only of great cultures but also of great empires, the Romanians are inheritors of the ancient Dacia, of Rome and of Byzantium. It has never been their fault that their land has on more than one occasion been a theatre of war. All too often neighbouring empires decided the destiny of the Romanians, arbitrarily modified the borders of their territories and influenced or brutally interfered with their internal development.\nAlmost 2000 years have elapsed since the famous Roman Emperor Trajan commissioned one of the greatest architects of the time, Apollodor of Damascus, to build the biggest bridge across the Danube so that his legions could enter Dacia Felix. It was the same Apollodor of Damascus who a few years later was to raise the Trajan Column in Rome, a monument that historians regard as the birth certificate of the Romanian people. As my illustrious predecessor, the leading diplomat of the period between the two world wars in Europe, the Foreign Minister of Romania, Nicolae Titulescu, used to recall, the cradle of the Romanian people is Transylvania. This people has lived and developed harmoniously and united within ethnically and historically defined borders. European by birth and mindful of their links with the family of Latin countries through their language, origin and culture, the Romanians aspire, by destiny and vocation, to their rightful place in the community of nations.\nFreedom of eternal Romania in its natural borders is their driving force. Less than two years ago, after a long night of dictatorships, the Romanian people regained, through their own sacrifices, their right to free and democratic development. The huge price they were forced to pay for their freedom has made them determined resolutely to protect and exercise their irreversible option for democracy, dignity and legality.\nRomania embarked upon her post-Communist history only about 20 months ago. The starting point was a stage of isolation and ideological and political dogmatism that had been unknown anywhere else in Europe.\nWe have already set up the new legislative and institutional framework required for the transition to a market economy. Private property has been recognized and guaranteed both in industry and in agriculture. Through appropriate legislation, economic and financial market mechanisms and the privatization of land, industry, trade and tourism have been set in motion.\nNone the less, our economic and financial situation is still in an alarming state. The new mechanisms are not yet functioning with the expected results. There is still resistance, reluctance and distrust about embarking upon comprehensive reform. Our Government is aware of the great risks and difficulties of the transition period. Inevitably its economic and social costs are high, as recognized by the international community. We shall have to pay them since, in this respect, there are no miraculous formulas that guarantee success.\nThe Government is endeavouring to maintain social stability in a dynamic environment imposed by reform. We are bound to succeed, but without substantial external support it will probably take us a long time. The assistance we have received from international financial institutions and from several developed countries has had a significant impact, but much more is needed for a modernised and restructured economy to take off. In this respect I would point out that Romania is a net creditor, since it has not contracted long-term loans. Payment of foreign debts due Romania, in particular by Iraq, is badly needed. We count on the understanding and support of the United Nations in recovering our outstanding loans.\nWe count especially on the support and solidarity of the European Economic Community (EEC) for a successful transition in our country. Our efforts to reinstate a market economy in Romania and to stimulate the free initiative drive of individuals would find a most happy catalyst in the EEC's decision to include Romania among its associate partners and, later on, among its members.\nHe are aware that it is not easy to qualify for such a position, but we are sure that, once such a possibility is clearly stated, the individual energies of Romanians would be fuelled and viable solutions to the myriad problems at present facing our country will be implemented because, after all, hope is a most important prerequisite for success.\nTaking into account the fact that the United Nations system is not en end in itself but a means aimed at protecting and promoting human dignity on an international scale, consideration of new and more efficient ways of achieving its goals should be of the greatest concern to us all. The main features of the emerging new structure of international relations in no way contradict the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. On the contrary, they are in line with the basic concepts of the Charter: security based on law; cooperation in ensuring a decent life for all peoples; and democracy as a framework to guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms for all human beings, irrespective of colour, sex, ethnic origin or faith.\nIt is therefore our common responsibility to build upon these positive developments and give them an irreversible and universal character. The United Nations is unique equipped to carry out the historic task of building a new world order based on human and democratic values, thriving market economies and peaceful international relations.\nIn our view, in order to maintain and consolidate international peace and security, action is required in several directions.\nIt is of fundamental importance in the first place to encourage and intensify efforts to settle existing conflicts which have so severely damaged the real interests of all parties involved and international relations as a whole. In particular, we should aim at preventing a possible multiplication of chronic conflicts. Unfortunately, Europe - or, more exactly, its eastern part - seems in recent months to have become a theatre of dangerous evolutions of this kind.\nTo our deepest regret, neighbourly and friendly Yugoslavia is severely affected by the consequences of a virulent and destructive conflict whose main lesson is that the use of force leads nowhere but to further complication of existing problems. We welcome and support the actions of the EEC aimed at encouraging a political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. We in Romania are of the opinion that the countries bordering Yugoslavia have a great responsibility to act in such a way as to prevent the aggravation of the conflict and even to facilitate a solution at the negotiation table. We also are of the view that this solution will be viable to the extent that it comes from within Yugoslavia. Its neighbours, the European countries and the United Nations have to do everything in their power to help the parties involved come to an agreement. Imposed solutions cannot last. It is the only wise course, consonant with both the interests of all the Yugoslav peoples and the objectives and common interests of the whole of Europe - and no less with those of the world at large.\nThe latest discussions and diplomatic consultations on the Yugoslav crisis have revealed certain approaches and ideas that should be addressed. It is difficult to base a new world order on the sovereignty of some but not all States. In the settlement of disputes, a free choice of means is the basic element of the Charter's philosophy. We should learn from the wisdom of past generations which, for instance, in dozens of treaties on the peaceful settlement of disputes expressly excluded from the arbitration procedure territorial and border problems. Do we want to abandon for Europe the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act concerning changes of borders? If we do, it would open up a Pandora's box.\nAs elsewhere in the world, the task before Europe is to step forward into the twenty-first century and not look back to the nineteenth century. One should never forget that the insane ambitions and aims of the totalitarian experiments that took place during the twentieth century on the soil of Europe did not in substance differ from the ambitions and aims of the \\\"classical\\\" empires. The only novelty that the Nazi and communist nightmares brought about was the aggressive use of their respective ideologies as a means to reach their oppressive ends. Therefore, while welcoming the crumbling of the last European empire, namely, the communist empire, every effort should be made to resist emerging political dreams of recreating in new forms old empires no less hostile to the peoples' rights to self-determination, sovereignty and independence.\nPlaced between two zones with a high potential for conflict, Romania is determined to do all in its power to remain a stable \\\"bridge of hope\\\" in Eastern Europe. It is in its national interest not only to stop at its borders the turmoil affecting two of its neighbours but also to contribute to the stability and security of the whole continent.\nDeeply aware of its responsibility and willing to assume it, the Romanian Government has engaged over these last weeks in intensive diplomatic activity. Our open and constructive dialogue with almost every party involved in or affected by the Yugoslav crisis - representatives of the central Government of Yugoslavia and representatives of Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia - and successive exchanges of views with Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey have been part of our efforts to promote a peaceful solution to the crisis affecting our common neighbour. There is hope. We should therefore explore the possibility of any efforts complementary to those already being carried on by the EEC and those that the United Nations could take upon itself, if our Organization deems it necessary to examine that specific crisis and make its own recommendations for its political solution.\nAs for the issues that have become \\\"traditional\\\" on the United Nations agenda, Romania welcomes efforts towards peace in the Middle East. We welcome also the progress being made towards the settlement of the situations in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, the Western Sahara and Central America.\nWhile pursuing the earliest possible conclusion or all existing conflicts, it is critically important to develop and strengthen United Nations procedures and mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes between States. As in medicine, it is easier to prevent than to cure. As emphasised again by the Secretary-General in bi-annual report, preventive diplomacy must acquire increased vigour. The Security Council, the General Assembly and the Secretary-General have considerably broader roles to play in this regard in the coming months and years. The adoption at this session of the declaration on fact-finding will provide material support for early action on the part of the United Nations to prevent armed conflicts and help bring about the pacific settlement of disputes.\nThe United Nations peace-keeping operations play an indispensable role in the settlement of conflicts. They can be further strengthened, both in terms of functioning and effectiveness. Me are ready to participate in such operations and, to this end, a number of Romanian personnel are undergoing special training.\nIt is being understood more and more that international order can be peaceful and lasting to the extent that it is based on democracy and on full respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual. The Romanian Government is genuinely committed to the promotion of human rights and democratic values. This fact will be fully reflected in the country's new constitution, which is to be concluded and promulgated a few weeks from now, and which will be tested in the forthcoming local elections, as well as in the general elections to be held next spring. We are of course aware that we are only at the beginning of our return to the democratic traditions of our country. In fact we are returning to normalcy, since, for us, communism meant abnormally and an anachronism. Our new democratic institutions are still fragile. We are counting on international cooperation with a view to strengthening them.\nEarlier this month, at the Moscow meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on the human dimension, our Government reiterated its determination fully to apply the European and the United Nations standards of democracy, human rights and the rule of law at home, and to contribute to their implementation abroad. We are looking forward to full membership for Romania in the Council of Europe and to its active participation in the human rights, social and cultural activities of this Organization.\nIn the same spirit we attach the utmost importance to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, which we see as another stepping-stone in the process of strengthening the fibre of peace, democracy, law and justice in all corners of our planet.\nIn our opinion, that Conference offers us a good opportunity to assess not only each country's performance in the field of human rights, but also jointly to assess the improvements that might be necessary as far as the United Nations instruments and mechanisms are concerned.\nIn this regard we would venture to suggest a possible subject for reflection. Taking into account the fact that regional experiences - and I have in mind especially the American and European ones - have proved that civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights constitute an integral whole and, on the other hand, that the two United Nations Covenants on Human Rights were adopted at a time when ideological divisions were dictating the tone within the United Nations, we could ask ourselves whether such a splitting is still justified and, in general, whether these Instruments should not be updated in the light of the significant changes brought about by the end of the cold war era. A new look should also be taken at other United Nations instruments and resolutions tainted with ideological or political motives, including the well-known 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.\nThe 1993 World Conference should also represent an important occasion for putting a final stop to tendencies to politicize minority issues, by taking them out of their natural framework, the framework of human rights: a framework which offers the best and the only viable answers to concerns about guaranteeing and respecting the legitimate rights of persons belonging to minorities and the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of minorities.\nA peaceful and democratic world order requires universal and unabated compliance by all with the rule of law. And there is no organisation better qualified to strengthen and develop international law than the United Nations. This is obviously the main purpose of the proclamation of the United Nations Decade of International Law, and Romania is fully committed to the attainment of its objectives.\nThe tasks ahead are not simple. To move from the concepts and mentalities of confrontation to those of cooperation and concord among all countries requires determination and great political vision. But that road must be travelled together, since that is the only way to avoid disaster and ensure a brighter future for all.\nHuman solidarity is the best means of advancing democracy throughout the world and of resisting any infringement of internationally accepted and consecrated rules of conduct. All of us were reminded of this by the coup in the USSR. One of the main explanations for its failure can be found in the determined and explicit international solidarity with, and support for, the democratic forces in the USSR.\nThe United Nations has a major role to play in consolidating the present historic trends. For this, increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations activities and mechanisms is essential. Therefore we welcome the various proposals with a view to making the Organization more effective and we intend to make a positive contribution to the achievement of early and substantive agreement on them.\nBoth memory and imagination should be our advisers in turning a new page of world history. Otherwise we would go towards a \\\"future past world\\\", rather than towards a safer, more peaceful, prosperous and democratic world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with profound pleasure that my delegation conveys to the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly the greetings of the Government and people of Grenada. It is our special honour to extend congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of this forty-sixth session. We are well aware, Mr. President, of your outstanding qualities and competence, and we are confident that you will guide the work of this session in a most exemplary manner. We also wish to congratulate Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta for the efficient manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-fifth session.\n\nThe commendations of my Government are extended to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his indefatigable efforts in the service of the United Nations. My delegation is also happy to extend a warm welcome to the new Members of the United Nations: the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republics of the Marshall Islands, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Surely this impressive list of new Members is testimony to the profound political changes now taking place throughout the world. The Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands have recently gained their independence. The Koreas have finally overcome decades of exclusion from membership of the United Nations, a condition that has for some time been politically untenable and wholly unrelated to their independent status. The Baltic States have, so to speak, regained their independence. Freedom, justice and democracy have again won a splendid victory. It is now almost eight years since Grenada was liberated from an ideology which was alien to our political culture. Each year has posed new challenges to national reconstruction and to the well-being of our people. Indeed, these have been difficult years, and, while we have achieved some measure of progress, our people are aware that even bigger hurdles to national development lie ahead. Since late 1983 we have focused on the rebuilding of our economy and the restoration of the democratic institutions enshrined in our Constitution. In fact, in August this year Grenada restored those provisions of our Constitution held in abeyance since their suspension in March 1979, thus returning our nation to full constitutional rule. In a related move, Grenada returned to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court System. These two accomplishments once again guarantee the full constitutional rights of our citizens. We have held two peaceful and free general elections. Previous Governments have done, and my Government is doing, much to cultivate political stability, which would cause our nationals, tourists and foreign investors to be anxious to do business with and in our beautiful country.\nOur domestic policies are aimed primarily at encouraging individuals, cooperatives and businesses to maximize the returns on their enterprise and efforts. At the same time, we seek to enhance opportunities for our working people to attain higher standards of living, through individual initiative and by building the virtue of self-reliance.\nThe political peace we have dutifully created is now being supported by a comprehensive development strategy, as contained in our first Medium-Term National Development Action Plan. We have set ourselves a number of targets, which include balanced and integrated sectoral growth; strategic human resource planning and development; a positive work ethic and a disciplined, healthy and skilled work force; a relevant and adaptive education system; enjoyment of all guaranteed constitutional rights and freedoms; and a peaceful and stable industrial relations climate.\nMy Government knows well the frustrations inflicted by very limited resources. Our people know the disappointment and pain of unfulfilled expectations. None the less, both Government and people recognize the need for sacrifice and patience as together we struggle to produce larger quantities of goods and services at more economical and competitive prices. Alas, however, we are constrained by the forces of the international financial and commodities markets. \nMy Government is convinced that the rate of development of Grenada - indeed, of any small island country - is a function of international economic and political trends. Although to a considerable extent the characterization of this phenomenon as global interdependence is apt, we must not lose sight of the blatant imbalances in economic and social development worldwide. Most importantly, we cannot be timid in speaking to the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing countries.\nThe case for official development assistance and the transfer of real resources from the North to the South has never been as strong as it is today. Massive debt burden, loss of earnings due to drastic declines in prices for raw-material exports, persistent poverty and marginalised economies are salient throughout the so-called third world. We in Grenada are creeping under the weight of debt and the pressure of economic difficulties. We recognize, however, that corrective action cannot be taken in isolation from non-national factors and actors.\nMaximum efforts are obviously required of us. It is unfortunate, however, that most of our people have to look to Government for their well-being, and continue to do so precisely at a time when the national economy cannot satisfy many of their reasonable expectations. We believe, though, that economic restructuring has its merit and holds the promise of a more secure economic future.\nAs individual developing countries embark upon such programmes, Grenada contends that enlightened support from international financial institutions is absolutely necessary. Debt forgiveness must be seen as a sensible option, as must new concessionary flows of official development assistance. The provision of special trade and investment regimes in favour of developing countries is vital to the economic viability of small States in particular at this time. Furthermore, the economic adjustments being undertaken require assistance to address the social costs of such adjustments.\nThe vigorous creation and consolidation of regional economic blocs can bring with them new sources of unease and new challenges to small States. While the economic logic and rationale for this development might be unassailable, Grenada appeals for special consideration for the products of traditional suppliers. If guaranteed access is replaced by unbridled price competition, without any compensatory mechanisms, social and political chaos will ravage the developing countries. The market-place has no social conscience.\nThe need for economic survival is no more acute in the newly free States of Europe than it is in the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa or Asia. Development, like poverty, does not discriminate between cultures. Grenada calls upon all States to pursue the drawing up of an equitable international development strategy. There is a clear need for strong multilateral initiatives within existing, but revitalized and reformed agencies of the United Nations. These agencies should be specifically mandated and financially furnished to provide for the development needs of poor countries. \nWe speak perceptively in international forums of the globalization of the world economy and the concept of global interdependence. For many decades industrialization and the technological revolution provided vast quantities of goods and services, which made possible the rapid economic advancement of some countries. For many years too, poverty and hunger permanently resided with others, where millions of people eked out a meagre livelihood from limited natural resources. The cost of this twin phenomenon is present today in environmental degradation. The problems are global; the responsibilities are global: firm corrective action therefore requires a coordinated global strategy.\nIt is in this context that Grenada looks forward to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992. We believe that the challenge to diplomacy and international law-making cannot be shirked. Restoring and maintaining a sense of balance between economic development and environmental preservation require equitable and effective international legal instruments. It is our hope that, apart from the negotiation and conclusion of conventions on climate change and the preservation of biodiversity, the special concerns and needs of small States will meet with genuine understanding and firm pledges of assistance.\nGrenada calls upon the international community not to relax its efforts to convince the industrialized countries, in particular, of the need to take urgent steps to save the environment. Small States must be assisted to find alternatives that will enable them to enjoy the beauty of the environment, rather than be forced to plunder its resources merely for survival. Let us go to Brazil with the political will and the commitment to save our planet and ourselves. The English-speaking Caribbean region is relatively peaceful and stable at this time. These conditions enable our countries to intensify the search for deeper forms of economic and political integration.\nGrenada wishes to reiterate its position that the economic and social prosperity of the people of the region is heavily dependent upon the success of our integration movement. In recent years we have regained much of the political commitment necessary for the advancement and consolidation of the Integration process, and Grenada is confident that the renewed vigour and momentum will be sustained.\nUndoubtedly, the bright prospects of improved welfare and security have impelled the leaders of the island States and the Commonwealth of Dominica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada to engage all sectors of the community in a careful and serious search for a viable form of political union among the four island States of the subregion. Our hopes are high that we shall be able to define ourselves as one people and to fashion an appropriate constitutional authority to provide for our orderly and progressive governance.\nGrenada believes that the need to take steps to strengthen the integration process in the wider Caribbean and in Latin America is becoming more urgent, given the pace and scope of global change. In this content we note the special role being played by Venezuela and Mexico and the recent proposal advanced by Honduras. Further cooperation and collaboration between countries of the region will no doubt serve to promote hemispheric unity.\nGrenada welcomes, with pleasure, the easing of tensions between Belize and Guatemala. The recent declaration by the Government of Guatemala that it recognizes Belize's right to independence and self-determination is very encouraging. So too is the news that the two countries have established diplomatic relations. We look forward to an amiable and definitive resolution of remaining difficulties between the two parties on the basis of the principles of mutual respect and good-neighbourliness.\nThe Government of Grenada deplores, in the strongest possible terms, the recent overthrow of the duly elected President of Haiti. Grenada believes that no comfort should be provided to the military junta which has seized power for its own selfish ends, in disregard of the will of the Haitian people for democracy, peace and progress. We call upon the international community to bring adequate pressure to bear on the military junta so that constitutional rule may be restored in Haiti. It is imperative that the international community give special attention to the existing problem regarding Haitian refugees. This has become even more urgent given the current situation there.\nThere are some who appear to believe that the political process now unfolding inside South Africa requires their immediate economic endorsement. Grenada notes, with some measure of relief, the abrogation of some of the legislative pillars of the apartheid system. But the motion of the process of fundamental constitutional change is very slow. So far none of the recognized rights and freedoms has been guaranteed to the black majority. Grenada reiterates its position that until that preferred goal is attained economic sanctions should be maintained so as to bring about the total demise of apartheid. My Government is also disturbed over the continuing violence in the black townships and deplores the perpetuation by some agencies of such road-blocks to the realization of a democratic South Africa.\nThe overall situation in the Middle East remains unsettled. In the aftermath of the Gulf War new opportunities for peace have emerged. Grenada supports the proposed Middle East Conference. In recent times there have been some noteworthy signs of positive movement and it is hoped that full advantage will be taken of the opportunity to settle the long-standing differences between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nThe Government of Grenada has viewed with relief the demise of communism in Europe. Eastern Europe generally and the Soviet Union in particular have experienced the power of democracy. We believe that the so-called newly free States of Europe are a historic prize for the discharge of the cold war. That prize has gone, deservedly, to the people. As the world feels its way in an era of seeming unipolarity, the security concerns of small States again come to the fore. The quest for security absorbs substantial economic resources that small States can ill afford. The vulnerability of small States may be defined not only in terms of direct attacks against territorial integrity but also in terms of the pervasive conditions of poverty and economic powerlessness. Regional cooperation arrangements provide an option, but it is respect for the independence of States, the right of their peoples to self-determination, and compliance with the rules of international law that constitute the best guarantee of security for small States. In the new international environment, Grenada sees the United Nations as having an even more vital role to play in buttressing the security and political independence of small States.\nThe problems posed by the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs cannot be wished away. Indeed, the very security of small States can be exposed and compromised by the violent and indiscriminate onslaught of the drug culture. Equally disturbing is its capacity to retard the development of our countries, to the extent that it demands and consumes considerable resources that could otherwise be utilized more productively.\nGrenada is determined to persevere in the fight. We have introduced a number of national programmes in this area and have entered into bilateral cooperation agreements with friendly countries. My Government is of the view that regional and international agencies mandated to work in this field should receive the maximum support of Member States. The drug problem is global. The response must, of necessity, be global in scope.\nThe decade of the 1990s continues to impose itself on the international community as if commissioned to effect political, economic and social change worldwide. Happily, democracy and freedom have been the major beneficiaries. From Grenada's perspective, we hope that our national development efforts will not be derailed but, in fact, will receive meaningful support from international financial institutions and friendly countries. It is our hope also that the new spirit of international cooperation will be consolidated and deepened so as to enhance the prospect for peace. The United Nations must be the focal point of international activity. This forty-sixth session of the General Assembly must play its part in providing opportunities for, and facilitating decisions among, the community of nations so as to advance the cause of peace and secure reasonable levels of sustained development, especially in the developing countries.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Malawi delegation, I am pleased to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia and the other members of the bureau on their election. We wish them success in guiding the deliberations of this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My delegation likewise congratulates Mr. Guido de Marco on having presided over the deliberations of the forty-fifth session so well.\nLike others before us, we welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as new Members of the Organisation. Their admission serves to reaffirm continuing international faith in the United Nations as the primary agency for the promotion and strengthening of worldwide cooperation and understanding. We are confident that the new Members will contribute to enabling the United Nations to fulfil its cherished purposes.\nWe note with particular interest that the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea has finally come about as a result of mutual agreement between the two on the issues. We are encouraged by this because we in Malawi have always maintained that no unilateral or externally imposed solution to conflicts or differences between any peoples can be permanent or universally acceptable. We hope, therefore, that their admission to membership in the United Nations will give encouragement to the two Koreas in their continuing search for solutions to the remaining issues dividing their peninsula.\nWe have noted with satisfaction that, notwithstanding the frightening jolt sustained from the Persian Gulf crisis and its aftermath, the trend towards greater international understanding and cooperation, especially in the political sphere, has continued during the past 12 months. As a result, the prospects for international peace and security, at least in the long term, would also appear to have improved.\nIn this context we welcome the signing in July of the strategic arms reduction Treaty {START) between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We also welcome the decision by the People's\nRepublic of China to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe past 12 months have witnessed greater efforts in the search for solutions to regional conflicts. More of these have now been resolved. We congratulate all those who contributed to this welcome development, and we wish success for those continuing initiatives aimed at finding solutions to conflicts still outstanding. In this connection, Malawi looks forward to a successful outcome to the referendum to be carried out soon on the future of Western Sahara.\nMeanwhile, we have warmly welcomed the ending at long last of the long, destructive fratricidal war in Angola. It is our sincere hope that the Angolan people will at last find the peace for which they have longed all these years. At the same time, we hope that the international community will give Angola all possible assistance in the enormous task of national reconstruction and development that now lies ahead.\nMalawi considers it a matter for deep regret that progress in the peace process in Mozambique has not been as rapid as indications had led us to hope 12 months ago. However, we note with some encouragement that the Government of Mozambique and the Mozambique National Resistance are determined to pursue their negotiations towards the conclusion of a mutually acceptable settlement. We continue to hope for a successful conclusion to those negotiations, and Malawi is always willing to make its modest, contribution towards that end.\nAs regards South Africa, we have followed very closely the developments there. Thus, we have welcomed the repeal in the middle of this year f the apartheid laws. We have also welcomed other measures taken by the authorities there in what would appear to be an earnest attempt to move more definitively towards the establishment of a just and equitable social, economic and political order.\nMalawi sees those developments as marking a major turning-point in the political evolution of South Africa. However, we do not lose sight of the fact that the real objective has not yet been achieved and, indeed, much more still remains to be done before this is so.\nA critical and delicate stage has now been reached in South Africa. We hope, therefore, that as all parties move to respond to the urgency of action now so clearly required, caution will be exercised to avoid any precipitate actions and decisions that are likely to hinder the realization of long-term national interests. We wish for collective leadership, pragmatism, patience and foresight as they prepare to face the most challenging phase in the process of political transformation upon which their country has now embarked.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a source of great concern. However, we have followed with much encouragement some of the developments which have taken place in the region during the past few months.\nWe are pleased that the civil war that ravaged Lebanon is now over. We note that while peace remains tenuous there are strong signs of growing confidence about the future. We therefore join the people of Lebanon in looking forward to the return of permanent peace and security to that country and we also share their hope to gain full control over their own destiny, free from external threats or interference. Consequently, we welcomed the decision by the Government of Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. We take this opportunity to echo the appeal for the withdrawal of all foreign elements, and for full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.\nWith regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict we note that recent initiatives aimed at arranging a regional peace conference have given rise to fresh hope for the resolution of the issues that have divided the Middle East for over four decades.\nAs a firm believer in the philosophy of contact and dialogue as the best approach to resolving inter-State conflicts or differences, Malawi has always supported the idea of holding a conference on the Middle East. We therefore support and welcome the current initiatives, and we are pleased to note that for the first time all parties concerned have declared their acceptance of such a conference. In our view, for the proposed conference on the Middle East to be meaningful, the following elements, which we consider essential, should be looked into thoroughly: first, all interested parties, especially those directly affected by the issues involved, should be properly represented; secondly, all representatives should be able to participate fully in the work of the conference; and, thirdly, the conference should address all the issues central to the Arab-Israeli conflict, taking account of all aspects of international law relevant to those issues.\nWe believe that only when all parties concerned are themselves able to make known their views on all the relevant issues directly can the conference arrive at an agreement to which all would truly and freely feel bound. Only such an agreement can be lasting and effective. It would be our hope, therefore, that as those concerned proceed with arranging for the regional peace conference on the Middle East, they will give due regard to these considerations.\nThe Malawi delegation regrets that the hopeful situation in the political sphere has not been matched by a similar trend in the economic field. The chasm between the developed countries of the North and the developing countries of the South has grown wider.\nParallel to the widening gap between the North and the South has been the ever-increasing inadequacy of financial resource flow. The servicing of debts presents yet another problem in the efforts to mobilize resources to support economic development. Indeed, the situation in a number of countries is so desperate that their viability has become questionable.\nWe have noted the various new initiatives which have emerged during the past year to redress the problems of the developing countries, especially the least developed countries. Unfortunately, many of these, like several previous ones, have tended to be largely palliative in nature and selective in application. Moreover, the non-economic conditionalities built into some of the initiatives have made them appear as no more than an attempt by the economically strong to control and manipulate the weaker economies.\nIn this connection, we should like to state that, notwithstanding the good intentions of our partners in development, that is, bilateral donors and the multilateral financial institutions, the tying of assistance to non-economic conditionalities does not yield the best results in terms of economic growth and development. In this regard, our experience in Malawi has been that where conditionalities are economic the economy responds positively; where they have been non-economic or unfeasible, the results have been adverse for the economy and the people of Malawi.\nThus, the Malawi delegation, while appreciating the good intentions of our partners in development, would like to use this forum to appeal to them not to disregard our contents on and objections to some of the conditions they may attach to their assistance.\nThe developing countries of the South desire to be self-reliant and not perpetually dependent on goodwill and charity from the North. In an increasingly interdependent world, they want to be able to contribute, as equal partners with the North, to global economic development.\nIn order to make such an economic order a reality, the South needs urgent and adequate assistance in building up sustainable economies. Currently, this would require the North to make further concessions on the debt burden facing the developing countries and give increased financial assistance, including the transfer of appropriate technology to the South. While these measures would stimulate industrial growth, support diversification and improve product quality, there is also an urgent need for an equitable international trading system in which commodities from the South will be assured of better access to the markets of the North and in which the South will be assured of a stable and profitable pricing system.\nThe International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, adopted by this Assembly at its last session, provides a framework for such a system. The Declaration adopted by the Assembly at its eighteenth special session established the blueprint for a practical partnership between the North and the South, which could make this new order a reality.\nIn this context, therefore, we feel that the failure of the Uruguay Round to conclude its work - which was due to the reluctance of certain interests pertaining to the North to accept compromises on a number of key issues, all of which are of vital interest to the South - does not augur well for the realization of the goals of the latest international Development Strategy. Similarly disconcerting was the failure of the Assembly at its forty-fifth session to adopt the draft resolution on United Nations operational activities for development or the draft code of conduct for transnational corporations. These developments have given rise to doubts about the viability of partnership in development and have tended to confirm the suspicions aroused by the lack of success in the implementation of the United Nations Plan of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The Assembly will be considering later the report on its final review and appraisal.\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the timely initiative of the United Nations on a matter which has in the past two years become another source of concern to the developing countries. I refer, of course, to the threat of marginalization of the developing countries as the aid-donor community has suddenly become enamoured of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\nIn this connection, we welcome the convening in July of this year in Geneva of the high-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council to consider this situation in the context of the impact of the recent evolution of East-West relations on the growth of the world economy, in particular on the economic growth and development of the developing countries, as well as on international economic cooperation.\nThe Malawi delegation fully supports the declaration of the Algiers Colloquium of May 1991, presented to the meeting in Geneva, and also the statement made at the same meeting by the Chairman of the Group of 77.\nMy delegation has taken careful note of the assurances given by the developed countries that economic assistance to the developing countries will in no way diminish as a result of assistance given to the newly democratic and market-economy States of Central and Eastern Europe.\nIt is our hope, therefore, that this session will give serious consideration to all these matters with a view to proposing ways in which genuine international economic cooperation can be made a reality. This is very important for international political stability and security because, as the Chairman of the Group of 77 stated at the high-level meeting in July \\\"Without a fair and balanced global economic order ... the world will witness chaos and civil strife bred by poverty and political cynicism.\\\" Malawi has followed with interest the preparatory work for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and looks forward to the \\\"Earth Summit\\\" to be held in Brazil in June of next year. Since this may be the only occasion for the General Assembly to review the preparatory work before the Conference convenes, we hope that the Assembly will use this opportunity to emphasize the need to ensure that the Conference will achieve lasting, practical results.\nBefore concluding, I wish, on behalf of the Malawi Government, to express appreciation for the assistance that Malawi continues to receive from the United Nations and its agencies. This contributes greatly to our social and economic development efforts.\nOn this occasion was especially want to express our sincere gratitude to the United Nations, to bilateral donors and other international agencies, for their timely and generous contributions which greatly facilitated the provision of emergency relief to the victims of the severe floods that affected several parts of our country early this year. Over 500 people perished in these floods while tens of thousands lost their homes and property, including their crops from this year's planting. The Government and people of Malawi are most grateful.\nFinally, we understand that Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar may shortly be stepping down as Secretary-General. On behalf of the Government and people of Malawi, we applaud his successful stewardship of our Organization. No doubt history will better record his own personal contribution to the promotion of international peace and security during the past 10 years. We congratulate him on a job well done and wish him well in all his future endeavours.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am truly honoured, Sir, to add Saint Lucia's voice to those of previous speakers who have congratulated you on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. The wealth of experience and great fund of diplomatic skills with which you adorn the presidency could never be better expended than now, as you summon them to guide the important work of this forty sixth session.\nSaint Lucia welcomes the international changes, and indeed the new spirit of entente that has allowed the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to move from the observation periphery to the centre of full membership in the Hall of this Assembly. My delegation was proud to be a sponsor of their membership application, and looks forward to working closely with them in the coming years, confident that this new step will not be a barrier to the desire for reunification,\nA special welcome must be extended to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which, against seemingly impossible odds, kept the dream of Baltic sovereignty alive. They have taught us all a new lesson in perseverance.\nAnd as for my fellow island developing countries of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, whose membership in the Organisation furthers the lofty goals of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. I greet them with fraternal love and look forward to working with them on matters of mutual concern.\nThe end of the last decade marked the twilight of the cold war. Tour and one-half decades of super-Power rivalry and East-West, tension were officially brought to an end as the Berlin Wall - the epitome of the iron curtain -crumbled, in the face of the long-simmering desire for German unity.\nAll over Europe, there were explosions of democracy: totalitarian regimes falling before floodtides of democratic movements, driven as much by economic need as by a collective desire to exorcise the legacies of Marx, Engels and Lenin; driven not only by the fact that man cannot live without bread, but also by the fact that he cannot live by bread alone. And, by and large, it was a democratic revolution, ignited by the hopes of the Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev. It was those very hopes that aborted the coup carried out against him and brought, about this purifying thunderstorm of reform of which he speaks. Indeed, there is a good in every evil, would men observingly distil it out.\nThere is urgent need, within the broad powers granted to the Security Council in Chapter VII of the Charter, for an early-warning mechanism to identify and react to emerging global issues before they reach the point of crisis. The situation in Haiti is a case in point.\nIn elections held in Haiti last December, transparently free and fair, witnessed by an international team, elections in which the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) played an important role, Jean-Bertrand Aristide received 1,107,125 votes out of the 1,640,729 votes cast. Eleven parties contested the elections. Two of them received 1.7 per cent of the votes. Aristide alone received 67.5 per cent. All the other 10 parties pledged to support the President in the task of building a democratic Haiti.\nI had the honour to head the team of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of CARICOM who went to Haiti in 1989, and was present at the inauguration of the President in February this year. Moreover, I saw with my own eyes the tens of thousands who hailed Aristide as their democratic liberator.\nMy delegation believes that the military in Haiti has shown itself to be too coup-prone in the past to be trusted to help a President maintain law and order. And we believe, too, that unless the military is replaced there will be no end to the tragic game of musical chairs being played with the lives of 6 million Haitians. If then a constitutionally elected President of the people, still overwhelmingly supported by them, as is President Aristide, were to ask the United Nations to restore Haiti to democratic rule in accordance with the will of the people of Haiti, my delegation would hasten to give an affirmative response to this request. Meanwhile, all necessary and appropriate means must, be employed to bring about a speedy return to constitutional government in Haiti .\nThe new world political order comes at a time of major economic crises in the world. Political gains cannot be sustained without concomitant economic output. The rate of growth of global economic output has declined for the past few years. From 4.3 per cent in 1988, it declined to 2.9 per cent in 1989 and to only 1 per cent in 1990; and it is expected to achieve zero growth this year. Nearly one-quarter of the world's pop;1ition now lives in countries with decelerating per capita output, and more people in the developing world are suffering from poverty and hunger today than was the case 10 years ago. The population of the developing countries has more than doubled in the past 35 years, increasing from 1.7 billion in 1950 to over 4 billion today. And it will grow to nearly 5 billion by the end of this century. Within the next 9 years, Africa alone will have an additional 200 million people, while Latin America and the Caribbean will have 100 million more.\nThis nightmarish population crisis, coupled with developmental stagnation, has created conditions wherein 2 billion people in the developing world have no access to safe water. And an equal number faces chronic hunger and malnutrition. Per capita food output is declining in about one third of the developing countries, and, if current patterns of deforestation, overgrazing and non-stop cultivation of overused lands continue, some 1.2 billion people in the developing world will be affected by desertification by the turn of the century.\nThe environment is not ours to destroy but to preserve for posterity, whose trustees we all are. The effects of deforestation on the environment are said to be second only to nuclear destruction. The ability of nation States to achieve sustainable development is central to the solution of this crisis. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development is therefore most welcome, and it is expected that the special circumstances of small island States, including Saint Lucia, will not be overlooked.\nMuch of Africa is stalled in a critical economic situation from which there seems little prospect of recovery, and Latin America is trapped in a downward cycle of debt, declining productivity and socio-economic privation. The same is true of some of the most populous Asian countries, and Eastern Europe is in economic turmoil. This dismal economic picture exists at a time when the world is facing the highest tide of rising expectations. Despite this, the new world political order presents an unprecedented opportunity for the further strengthening of the United Nations to deal with contemporary problems and to prepare it for future ones.\nWe cannot but praise the rejuvenated functioning of the Organization in facilitating solutions to the myriad political problems that we ourselves continually create. The ongoing initiatives in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Western Sahara and Cyprus must be encouraged. And the new areas of election supervision must be continued.\nWhen Iraq invaded the peaceful and comparatively small nation of Kuwait, this wise and caring family of nations for seven months counselled Iraq to return to its own home lest the wrath of the family be visited upon it. Though the wages of its bellicosity, cupidity and intransigence have already been justly handed out to Iraq, still that country seems intent on obstructing the will of the United Nations.\nIf Iraq dared to challenge virtually the whole of mankind without nuclear weapons, it makes one shudder to think how it might otherwise have acted with them. That is why the present investigation into Iraq's nuclear capabilities must be carried out thoroughly for the peace and security of the world. Now that the war is over, it is but right that we pay a tribute to those who have contributed so much to this important cause. He must also salute those who exercised tremendous restraint in the face of provocation. This restraint prevented a widening of the conflagration which might have engulfed the entire region.\nIt is a fact that South Africa under President De Klerk has undergone some praiseworthy reforms. But there is still no clear evidence of profound and irreversible change. The equal right of all South Africans to vote for a Government of their choice, enshrined in a non-racial democratic constitution, is a major constitutional fundamental around which all other reforms would revolve. We therefore reiterate that the removal of economic sanctions would be premature and would not hasten, but retard, the process which has begun.\nFor more than two decades now, we have been fighting a battle against drugs. Are we winning the battle or are we losing the battle? If we are losing it in the streets of New York and Chicago, in London and in Birmingham, in Paris and in Lyon - if we are losing it there, where can we win? And if we are losing it in the lands of plenty, we are condemned to lose it in the debt-overburdened countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and the poverty stricken countries of the Sahel and elsewhere.\nBut why are we losing it? Maybe the answer lies not only in the severe punishment of drug traffickers and the confiscation of the proceeds of their crime, but in the strengthening of the family unit and in developing a true sense of values. Maybe we could begin by distributing some of our yearly expenditure on arms of some $900 billion among the poor so they could give more and more of themselves to their children. For the battle must first be fought at home. And it must be fought early. And if this generation is already too far gone, let us begin today to save the children of tomorrow.\nSince January this year a constituent assembly of the Windward Islands of Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Saint Lucia has been discussing the question of a political union of these four islands. A referendum on this issue is to await final discussions, in January next, of the economic implications of such a union. My delegation is convinced that a federation of these small islands will guarantee their stability, thereby increasing their investment opportunities and enhancing their economic viability, their negotiating capacity and their administrative efficiency. We must unite to survive. In this regard, I am certain that we can depend on the good will of the international community.\nOn 31 December 1992 the European Economic Community, in its wisdom, will become one giant common market of some 350 million people. For us in the Windward Islands, who depend very largely for our daily bread on the export of bananas to the United Kingdom, this could have disastrous consequences were we to lose the preferential treatment that the United Kingdom has guaranteed us for the past 40 years. The European Commission has assured us, however, that the new marketing arrangements will not, in the circumstances, deprive us of that facility, which we have enjoyed for so long. On the dependability of this assurance rests the economic survival of these islands, and I trust that we shall not have to wrap our hands around the knees of the European Community to plead our case. The Community, among others, has shown much beneficence towards the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, of which we are one. We can always count on its good will, understanding and cooperation.\nThe United Nations, having had a meteoric rise during the recent past, stands at a crossroads, from which the path ahead can lead to genuine world political, economic and social development. But if that is to happen, the major Powers must take the degree of their cooperation far beyond the political pinnacle, deep into the world's socio-economic substrata, which is ultimately where universal peace and security will be formulated. Let no nation divert us from this path by waking the sleeping hand of war.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLike those who have preceded me to the rostrum of the Assembly, I would like in my turn to congratulate Mr. Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His brilliant election represents not only a well-deserved recognition of his many qualities, but also the esteem his country, Saudi Arabia, enjoys in the world for its devotion to the cause of international peace, security and cooperation. The delegation of Benin is convinced that, under his guidance, our work will be crowned with success.\nMy delegation would also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Guido De Marco, who led our deliberations with great competence during the forty-fifth session, which was characterized by a deepening in our common thinking on restructuring and revitalizing our Organization and by our desire to achieve consensus on the aims of the San Francisco Charter.\nThe Government of the Republic of Benin is grateful to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose tireless efforts to achieve the United Nations objectives of peace and justice have undeniably help to accelerate the political transformations under way in the world. These transformations have already been reflected in the end of the cold war, characterized by all types of rivalries at every level. Mow that his second mandate is coming to an end, we convey to him our country's appreciation for the great devotion he has shown as head of our Organization.\nIn this tribute, I also include all those, near or far, who work with the Secretary-General. They spare no effort to ensure the smooth running of our Organization and the triumph of the noble ideals on which it is based. It is my pleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General most especially for his excellent annual report, which takes account of the prestige of the United Nations and is forward-looking within the context of strengthening the irreplaceable role of the United Nations on the international scene.\nThe universality of our Organization has been furthered by the admission of new Members again this year. We welcome the Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - which have regained their sovereignty after more than 40 years of annexation. Similarly, we congratulate the two Pacific States, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. All of these States are now Members of the United Nations. He would like to assure them of our full cooperation in achieving our common ideals.\nWe would also like to extend words of welcome to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to the Republic of Korea upon their admission to membership of the United Nations. He hope that, in the near future, in the like the peaceful reunifications of Yemen and Germany, we will witness that of the Korean nation, which will put an end to the long and painful night of separation and help to resolve one of the thorny problems linked to the cold war on the Asian continent.\nWe are also extremely pleased by the return to our midst of the Cambodian delegation headed by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\nLate in the twentieth century, history is going through changes of exceptional depth and scope. My delegation would therefore like to welcome the positive and encouraging events that are strengthening international peace and security. After a terrible arms race, the United States of America and the Soviet Union have today courageously embarked upon a veritable disarmament marathon with a view to creating a safer and more stable world. The recent initiative of United States President George Bush in proposing the elimination of all land- and sea-based short-range tactical nuclear weapons - an initiative that was positively received by the main nuclear Powers, particularly the Soviet Union, whose President Mikhail Gorbachev has responsibly taken up the challenges of peace - is significant in that respect. In this same context we welcome the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime with the decision to adhere to the 1968 Treaty not only of two nuclear Powers - France and China - but also of non-nuclear-weapon States. We therefore expect that this Treaty will be renewed or made permanent, when it expires in 1995. This would open the way to increased international cooperation for the peaceful use of atomic energy.\nThe era of confrontation is being replaced - slowly but surely - by that of international cooperation, and in the place of political and ideological rivalries we see the emergence and consolidation of a spirit of solidarity and a growing awareness of the necessary complementarities. Thus the major protagonists of the past, the United States and the Soviet Union, have established policies of cooperation expressed in their sustained efforts to limit weapons, in particular by the implementation of the 1987 Treaty on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty) and the signing in Moscow on 31 July 1991 of the Treaty on strategic arms reduction (START Treaty), whose aim is to spare us a nuclear conflagration.\nIn a regional context, I would like to mention the positive developments in the situation in El Salvador, which are due to the efforts of the Secretary General and to the initiatives taken by the Latin American States that met recently in Mexico City to establish the foundations of true regional cooperation and economic integration. These are measures that will build confidence end security with a view to the irreversible return of peace to that region.\nWhat can one say about the development of democratic movements in the world? These have been manifested, inter alia. by the political pluralism that has already enabled my country, Benin, to establish, after almost two decades of monolithic government, a legislative organ, a Chief Executive elected by direct universal suffrage, and a truly independent judiciary to protect our freedoms.\nWe are proud of being a part of the development of democracy, which is spreading further over the world every day, as witnessed by the failure of the attempted coup d'etat against the reform policies of the Soviet President. Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev. This development enhances the moral authority of our Organisation, which is rightly based on the promotion, defence and protection of fundamental human rights, including civil and political rights for the preservation of international peace and security.\nHowever promising the new political situation prevailing in the world today may seem, we cannot forget, amid the euphoria of the real attainments of democracy, freedom and International cooperation, that, unfortunately, unacceptable disequilibrium, unbearable Injustice and dangerous hotbeds of tension still exist on our planet. In other words, international peace and security remain fragile.\nIn South Africa, we are witnessing the collapse of the pillars of apartheid - a system that, in its very essence, is harmful to the human dimension of security. We can only say how pleased we are about this. However, there is every reason to be concerned about the persistence of violence - it is time to put an end to this, once and for all - and about, the absence of real progress in the preparation of a democratic and non-racial constitution based on the principle of one man, one vote. We therefore appeal to all the peoples of the world to reaffirm their determination to harness their efforts to assist the people of South Africa to regain its complete freedom as soon as possible.\nThat is why the international community in general and Africa in particular must remain vigilant and must maintain existing measures against South Africa, in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session, devoted to apartheid and its harmful consequences in southern Africa, until it has been very clearly demonstrated that the present course is irreversible. It would be illusory to believe that the removal of the sanctions imposed on South Africa could lead to a rapid change in the system of government by the white minority.\nFurthermore, we encourage the South African opposition to unite for the purpose of accelerating this evolution, which will make it possible for South Africa to contribute to securing the peace and progress to which the peoples of southern Africa aspire. Those peoples have suffered too long from terror and destruction. In that respect, the cessation of internal hostilities in Angola, following the signing of  a cease-fire agreement on 31 May 1991, is an encouraging sign of an end to more than 15 years of civil war, which has ruined the country. We hope that the same will prove to be true with regard to Mozambique. We hope also that the peoples of these two countries will be enabled to enjoy the peace that is so essential to national reconstruction and well being.\nBenin is pleased at the agreement that has been achieved between independent Namibia and South Africa on the question of Walvis Bay and the neighbouring islands, in accordance with the spirit of Security Council resolution 432 (1978). The settlement of this important question will make it possible to consolidate Namibia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to create the conditions for the economic integration of a prosperous southern Africa.\nElsewhere in Africa, certain fraternal countries have not been spared civil wars born of ethnic conflicts, social and political injustice and violations of human rights. It is our duty to continue relentlessly to recommend to those involved that they resort to the virtues of dialogue to resolve their internal disputes. \nIn this respect, the international community must not spare any effort in encouraging regional initiatives, such as those of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAD) regarding Ethiopia and Somalia which supported the efforts undertaken by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti to bring peace back to the Horn of Africa, or those of the Economic Community of West African States with respect to Liberia, taken up recently in Yamoussokro at the second meeting of the so-called Ad Hoc Committee of Five under the auspices of President Houphouet-Boigny. Benin is pleased at the efforts that have begun to be deployed by the Senegalese and Mauritanian authorities to restore relations of cooperation and good-neighbourliness between the two countries. These relations have deteriorated since August 1989.\nIn the north of the continent, the Governments and peoples of the Maghreb have been aspiring to more cooperation, and the efforts they have been making along these lines must be encouraged for the sake of the development of the Arab Maghreb Union.\nIf there remains a significant obstacle to realization of this desire, it is the question of Western Sahara, where the praiseworthy efforts of our Secretary-General have not yet led to peace, despite the recent cease-fire. However, my delegation has no doubt that the parties involved will cooperate with the Secretary-General in the context of implementation of the settlement plan endorsed in Security Council resolution 658 (1990), which provides for a self-determination referendum under the auspices of the United Nations and the OAU. My country is honoured to be one of those that have participated directly in the field in this peace mission set up under Security Council resolution 690 (1991). Since our last session the situation in the Middle East has not improved. The international community was heart-sore at the war between Iraq and the coalition of States that, quite rightly, cooperated with Kuwait. That war - caused by Iraq's aggression against the sovereignty of Kuwait - ended with victory for the coalition, but without solution of the basic problems that inflame the region. Not only has Iraq, which invaded Kuwait - now liberated - been destroyed; Kuwait too is in ruins. This distressing spectacle faces mankind with serious moral problems. Must we embark on massive destruction of the heritage of all mankind before we begin to reconstruct, at great expense?\nThe Republic of Benin has always respected the principles of the Charter, and we condemn any use of force to settle disputes between States. He feel that mankind will be running real risks if, as in the past, it drags its feet with regard to the question of a comprehensive and urgent resolution of the question of the Middle East. As in the case of the war against Iraq, the question of the conflict between Israel and its neighbouring Arab States, the question of Palestine, which has not yet been settled; and the question of Lebanon, where foreign troops are still present, and in respect of which one cannot speak of true national reconciliation, still pose a threat to international peace and security.\nThere is thus an urgent need for specific and concerted measures taking into account, in particular, the rights of all the States in the region, including Israel, as well as the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people, in order that a comprehensive, just and lasting peace may be achieved. In our view, only a sincere and frank dialogue between all the parties involved will make possible a just and final solution to the Israeli Palestinian problem. From that standpoint, my country hopes that the consultations undertaken by the United States authorities will succeed in leading to the convening of a regional conference. We we1come the support shown by the Palestine National Council, at its recant meeting in Algiers, for the United States Initiative.\nIn Europe, the reunification of the Island of Cyprus is also an urgent task whose completion is in the interests of peace and security, which are threatened by nationality conflicts such as that in Yugoslavia. Benin is concerned with the tension which prevails in that country, whose ideals of non-alignment we share. Thus, we urge mutual understanding among all the components of that Federation, so that peace and security may be restored through negotiation.\nIn Asia, following the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, it is essential that the various parties embark on negotiations with a view to bringing about a restoration of national unity and peace.\nWe congratulate Cambodia, which has been ravaged by a dozen years of civil war, on the establishment of a cease-fire. But the various factions must still overcome the internal controversies which impede the implementation of Security Council resolution 668 (1990), aimed at organizing free and fair elections under the auspices of the United nations.\nHow that the world seems to be embarked on an irreversible course to end the policy of blocs, where the obsession with military security is no longer appropriate, prospects seem to be opening up for arms limitations. The final objective is general and complete disarmament which will release substantial resources for the development of the poorest countries of our planet.\nIn other words, our Organization will have to take up additional challenges arising from the continuous deterioration of the international socio-economic situation which poses another threat to international peace and security.\nIndeed, poverty, want, famine, malnutrition, sickness, drug abuse, the deterioration of the environment kill more people in a few days than did the Hiroshima bomb. Are these ills not the daily lot of a major portion of the peoples of this world? And nowhere is the situation as serious as in Africa, as the Secretary-General emphasized in his annual report. The international community is suffering from unacceptable ills at the end of the twentieth century, despite all the progress achieved by mankind. Despite the immense resources of the modern world and the extraordinary scientific and technological progress, people on our planet still find it difficult to exist or even to survive.\nThe economic situation In the developing countries has barely improved, despite attempts to remedy it. There is no doubt that this is the most serious threat to international peace and security in a constantly changing world where the means of communication enable the poor to observe the insolent wealth of the rich. An international order which allows more than half the population of the planet to die of hunger and ignorance is doomed to failure.\nThe Declaration adopted at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to international economic cooperation, held in April-May of 1990, did not fail to sound its traditional alarm. It was recognised by all that the solution lies in the adoption of national policies to liberalise trade so as to respond more flexibly to the evolution of the economy.\nFurthermore, the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris in September 1990, recommended to the international community in its final Declaration that greater attention be focused on these countries in view of their specific problems.\nIn this respect, we would recall that during that meeting the President of the French Republic, Mr. Francois Mitterand, reiterated his appeal in favour of development and a more just and equitable world order. The profound changes under way will have failed to achieve their essential objectives if they do not take into account and settle the question which has become primordial, namely, the organization of planetary solidarity; in other words, if they do no tackle the fundamental problems of Worth-South relations, and in particular those linked to African debt, the impoverishment of our continent, and the accompanying train of want, sickness and unemployment. In effect, the situation in Africa, where most of the least developed countries are to be found, is hardly encouraging.\nAlmost all African countries have programmes for the restructuring of their economies in accordance with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the positive effects of which are still to be seen.\nFaced with the uncertain future of all these countries, at their last summit meeting the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OA.U), recognized the need for stopgap measures by encouraging regional economic integration to be achieved in the next three decades, and to take shape in the African Economic Community.\nBut in the short term, Africa will continue as in the past to make appeals to its creditors to undertake to do more to help find a solution to the painful debt problem and thereby help complete its internal efforts to achieve development.\nWe commend deservedly the efforts undertaken by some States to arrange a partial rescheduling or cancellation of certain debts in third-world countries in general, and of those in Africa in particular, and I appeal to other States to do the same in the interests of all. For, if nothing is done today to guarantee for our youth a future that is humanely acceptable, the difficult constraints and the many privations imposed by the economic adjustments which are being made all over the continent, will most definitely lead to social problems end political Instability that no coercive measure will be able to contain for long.\nTo rescue Africa from its desperate economic situation, rapid action on the part of the international community is indispensable.\nIndeed, it is clear that, after the failures of the years which followed independence and the impasse into which the militarist-socialist-Marxist revolutions of the continent have led, the era of democracy runs the risk of leading our States - if nothing specific and substantial is done in the next five yearn into chaos. This Is hardly something we would like to happen.\nThat is why the international community, in particular the developed countries, must undertake to help Africa put. into effect the proposals of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole entrusted with the examination and final evaluation o the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986 1990 (UNPAAERD), which was held here at the United Nations Headquarters from 3 to 14 September 1991. In this context, I appeal to all delegations to adopt the two documents submitted for their attention by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole under item 4 of the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.\nThe adoption by consensus of these two documents will make it possible to implement, proposals to reverse the trend towards the decline and the increasing impoverishment of the African States and to raise the very low standard of living of the rural populations, who are the principal victims of all these political and economic failures of the continent since independence. The future of mankind depends, too, on a sound management of the environment and a lasting development strategy within the context of the initiative taken by the General Assembly when it adopted resolution 44/228 on the convening in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1 to 12 June 1992 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the third session of whose Preparatory Committee was held in Geneva from 12 August to 4 September 1991.\nWe sincerely hope that our Heads of State and Governments will examine with all due care the problems of protecting the environment and the closely linked problems of harmonious and lasting development, and that their analyses and decisions will be based on the valuable documents being prepared by our experts in the various negotiating committees and working groups.\nConfident, therefore, that the Rio Conference in 1992 will be crowned with success, I should like to anticipate events by saying that we must collectively and individually commit ourselves, especially the most developed and wealthiest among us, to implementing the decisions taken. They will cover financial mechanisms; the transfer of new, clean technology; and legal and institutional machinery. The consensus that will be achieved both by the Preparatory Committee, which will complete its work in March and April 1992, and the Conference itself in June 1992 will not mean the triumph of the ideas of a group of States of one hemisphere over another, but will be the result of a common political will to achieve a common dream for a common cause without frontiers: Planet Earth.\nWhile awaiting the deliberations in Rio next June and the implementation of the decisions taken there, Benin, like some other countries, is periodically suffering natural disasters which in a few hours destroy the development efforts made with a great deal of determination and enthusiasm. This year again, for the fourth time in 10 years, Benin was the victim of floods in its southern region following downpours lasting from May to July. Those floods caused loss of human life and of millions of hectares of crops as well as displacements of people and the destruction of dwellings.\nI take this opportunity to express our thanks once again to all those who responded to the appeal of Benin's Head of State, President Nicephore Soglo,\nand of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Belief Coordinator (UHDHO) by providing us with various types of emergency aid. We express our gratitude to them and sincerely hope that the International Decade for natural disaster Seduction will make it possible to carry out reconstruction projects to deal with disasters that have already occurred as well as to take measures to lessen the effects of future disasters.\nIn addition, aware that man remains the subject and the author of all processes of transforming society, and that there can be no real, lasting progress without freedom, Benin has embarked on a democratic process, and, as I have already said, has been able to complete successfully its first elections.\nI invite the industrialized countries and international organizations to provide massive aid to the emerging democracies in the countries of the South, in a spirit of solidarity similar to that which they have shown with regard to the countries of Eastern Europe. That is the only way to enable those democracies to achieve quickly the material conditions necessary to consolidate themselves and gradually to get out of the economic morass they find themselves is and escape its consequences.\nSimilarly, at the political level, the condemnation of COUPS d'etats and support for democratic regimes, such as that in Haiti, must occur spontaneously and immediately, as happened with regard to the coup d'etat against President Gorbachev. Therefore, my Government firmly supports all the efforts to restore to power President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the constitutionally elected President of Haiti. Convinced that power comes from the ballot box, and not front brute force, Benin warmly welcomes the strong resolution unanimously adopted by leaders of the Organization of American States (OAS) on 30 September this year in Washington, and hopes that the statements made in the Security Council on 3 October and in various capitals of the world will be translated into concrete deeds. The Haitian people chose democracy in a sovereign act. The international community, which gave its help to that end, must help them to restore and consolidate democracy.\nFinally, the nascent democracies in Africa and elsewhere cannot grow stronger without building true States of law, where respect for human rights and the furtherance and defence of human rights and the rights of peoples are not empty words but realities, translated into deeds in everyday life. To that end, my country is already taking useful steps to ensure worthwhile participation in the World Conference on Human Rights, to be held at a high level in 1993.\nWe very much hope that the debates at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly will allow us to consolidate the gains made in maintaining international peace and security. They strengthen our hope that the international cooperation and solidarity are also essential to realise its destiny.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is indeed for me a great honour and privilege to address the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. This occasion not only presents the first opportunity for me to address this world body in my capacity as the Interim President of the Republic of Liberia, but even more important, it also affords me a special opportunity to discuss the all-important issues of peace and stability the world over, and in the case of Liberia the current efforts towards the institution of genuine pluralistic democracy.\nBefore doing so, I extend my sincerest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. We are confident that, under your able leadership, the deliberations on issues assigned to this session will be carried out with diplomatic finesse and dispatch. As you undertake this arduous task, let me assure you that the Liberian delegation will lend very support to ensure that our collective efforts Met with success.\nI should also like to register our appreciation to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, for the efficient and statesmanlike manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-fifth session of the Assembly. We wish him well in his future undertakings.\nIt is fitting to express special gratitude to the Secretary-General, Javier Peres de Cuellar, whose tenure has seen the United Nations as an organisation come into its own and exhibit unprecedented effectiveness in recent years. We salute the Secretary-General for his efforts in the search for global peace and his concern for the less fortunate of this world. His advocacy of fairness and justice has rekindled mankind's assurance that the United Nations is the appropriate forum capable of meeting the ever-changing challenges of our world.\nRecently the United Nations took on a more universal character when seven States were admitted to membership in the Organization. The Liberian delegation welcomes most heartily in our midst Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and looks forward to their active involvement in the affairs of the United Nations.\nAt a time when the world is rapidly changing and the political polarities which characterized the past four and a half decades are fast crumbling, it is expected, and rightly so, that countries like mine, which are Charter Members of the United Nations, offer an appreciation of these events, especially in the light of the expectations of a new world order as envisaged at the time of the San Francisco Conference. Liberia bears a responsibility at this time to make a pronouncement on how far Africa has progressed and fared in relation to the aims of this new world arrangement that will be based on equity, justice and fair play. Regrettably, the situation in which we find ourselves today leaves us no such opportunity, other than to give members an overview of recent developments in our country.\nWe Liberians are embarrassed by the fact that we have used up so much of the time, resources and energy of our West African subregion on a fratricidal conflict. He permitted ourselves to degenerate to a stage where we not only became the problem-child but posed a serious threat to the nations of that region. As I speak to you today more than 800,000 of our people, constituting approximately 30 per cent of our population, are refugees in neighbouring countries. Worse still, from our territory an invasion was launched into Sierra Leone, thereby paying the people of that friendly country who have done all within their power to care for Liberian refugees, with ingratitude for their sacrifices and hospitality. We condemn the invasion of Sierra Leone and we stand in full solidarity with the government and people of that brotherly country in resisting this aggression.\nIt has been stated and demonstrated so many times that peace is a necessary precondition for development and security. The prosperity that is exhibited in certain parts of the world could be largely attributed to the fact that peace has reigned in those countries for a considerable length of time, thereby making possible the technological, social, economic and political progress which their populations today enjoy.\nOur concept of peace is based upon our abiding belief in the protection and promotion of human rights. By this we mean we believe in the integrity of the human person, the right freely to choose those who govern us, the right freely to participate in the decision-making process affecting our destiny and the right of due process.\nThe momentous changes that are taking place in various parts of the world are motivated by the desire of the peoples of these countries to enshrine in their laws the enjoyment of these rights. These are the fundamentals for peace. It is for these reasons that the Interim Government of National Unity is totally committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and condemns the violation of those rights wherever they may occur. Liberia needs peace - peace based on these fundamentals!\nIn the light of this conviction the Interim Government of National Unity reaffirms its commitment to the holding of free and fair general and presidential elections under international supervision in its effort to restore peace in Liberia. It is heartening to note that this effort is largely being supported by our brothers and sisters in the West African subregion. For more than a year now, the leaders of our subregional organization have been preoccupied with the Liberian conflict. There have been many halting steps and diversions along the way. None the less, we have made solid progress since we addressed members at the forty-fifth session.\nFor the first time in our crisis, all sides seem convinced that we have now entered on the final stretch of the journey to a lasting settlement. For this, we are truly grateful to the members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), especially those whose troops make up the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (EC0M0G). It was that Group, operating as a peace-keeping force, that put an end to the carnage and destruction that was going on in Liberia.\nWe salute the Governments and peoples of the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone for responding with dispatch to the call for the establishment of the peace-monitoring force ECOMOG. We also salute the Governments and peoples of Mali and now Senegal for further strengthening ECOMOG.\nWe must say without equivocation that our nation would have perished were it not for the wise and timely decisions of the ECOWAS Standing Mediation Committee. It is gratifying to note that this particular arrangement of regional assistance is \\\"home grown\\\" and is now increasingly being emulated and adapted by others. We say, Why not? When the expenditure on national defence is set against the need for economic development, the reasonableness of a collective regional defence becomes overwhelming. It is for this reason, among others, that the Republic of Liberia supports the call for the establishment of regional defence organs: ECOMOG is a good start.\nIt is pertinent to mention at this point the undue burden which the countries that contribute to ECOMOG are shouldering in their peace-keeping operations in Liberia. We note with satisfaction the recent announcement of assistance by the United States Government to some members of ECOWAS in relation to their peace-keeping role in Liberia. We consider this encouraging, especially in the light of the assurance that further assistance to these countries will be forthcoming. We urgently appeal to all nations, especially the industrialized countries, to emulate this example and to offer substantial assistance to the countries that are at present engaged in the peace-keeping effort in Liberia.\nWhen the history of our conflict is written, the most gratifying aspect will be the revelation that one of the most fratricidal conflicts in Africa will have been resolved almost entirely by the Governments and peoples of our subregion. In this respect, the men and women of ECOMOG whose blood has been shed for their brothers and sisters in Liberia will leave a lasting mark in the annals of our history. Fully recognizing the enormous sacrifices and indispensable contributions of the men and women of ECOMOG, Liberians everywhere will continue to say, \\\"Thank God for ECOMOG!1'\nWe cannot conclude these remarks without lauding the Governments and peoples of a number of countries who, through various charitable organizations, demonstrated genuine concern for humanity by giving needed assistance to hapless civilians during the Liberian civil conflict. These organizations - Action internationale contre la faim and Medecins sans frontieres of France; Catholic Relief Services, Christian Reformed World Relief Committee, Church World Service, Community of Caring, Plan International, World Vision, Adventist Development Relief Association and Baptist Relief of the United States of America; OXFAM, Save the Children Fund and Caritas of the United Kingdom; Concern and GOAL of Ireland; German Emergency Doctors; the International Committee of the Red Cross and Lutheran World Services of Switzerland; Medecins sans frontieres of Belgium; Medecins sans frontieres of Holland; the Swedish Relief Corporation of Sweden and the Christian Reformed World Relief Committee of Canada - will forever be remembered by the Liberian people.\nLast year in this Hall the international community acknowledged the importance of putting the world's children high on the development agenda and committed itself to giving them a \\\"first call\\\". As the hardest-hit victims of our civil strife, the Liberian children are our \\\"first call\\\". The Interim Government of National Unity has embarked on several projects to address the plight of Liberian children.\nWe must tell you that our hearts have been touched by the great generosity and good will of the peoples and Governments of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Republic of the Gambia, the United States of America and the European Economic Community. The peoples of those countries, in addition to all that they have done for the Liberian people, have made separate generous donations of food and medicines to Liberians.\nNor can Liberians forget the kindness of the peoples of the Republics of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, the Gambia and other countries of our subregion, who have played and continue to play host to our citizens.\nWe want also, on behalf of the people of Liberia, to extend our gratitude and appreciation to the United Nations and its specialized agencies for their contributions in providing humanitarian aid to our people.\nIt is with much satisfaction that I inform you that Liberians have at long last reached a consensus on a strategy for settling the Liberian conflict. The strategy to which we have all committed ourselves is that of holding, free and fair elections under international supervision. A necessary precondition for the holding of those elections is the creation of adequate security arrangements throughout the country.\nIn this regard the agreement reached in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'lvoire, on 17 September 1991 it most encouraging. At that meeting Liberians manifested both the will and the resolve to succeed in this election enterprise by agreeing to encamp and disarm all forces under the supervision of an expanded ECOMOG - the Ceasefire Monitoring Group of the Economic Commission of West African States.\nAs a follow-up to the conclusions reached at that meeting Liberians have since held consultative meetings among themselves and have announced the members of both an elections commission, and an ad hoc supreme court for the country. The establishment of an elections commission is a significant milestone on the road to peace. It is intended to be an independent body free from government policies and influence. As a country with limited experience in the conduct of free and fair elections, Liberia hereby requests the international community to provide adequate technical and financial assistance for the electoral process.\nFurther to our efforts to ensure the credibility of the electoral process we have invited the International Negotiation Network (INN), headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Economic Community of West African States, the United Nations, the Republican Institute for International Affairs and the National Democratic Institute, both of the United States of America, and other relevant organizations to supervise and monitor the forthcoming elections.\nOur yearnings for peace, security and democracy will remain expressions of fine words and sentiments if the present economic conditions in which all of us in Africa find ourselves were to continue. The combination of our debt burden, commodity prices, fluctuating exchange rates and the instability built into our respective systems by the weakness of our political institutions make it mandatory that the developed countries and the international system take a more realistic view of our problems. In the case of Liberia, the protracted civil conflict has compounded our plight even further.\nWe maintain the view that democracy and political pluralism cannot be sustained on an empty stomach. We therefore appeal to the United Nations, its agencies, the international community, and especially the international financial institutions to re-examine their attitudes towards the developing countries.\nLiberia is faced with serious economic problems. My country has a debt burden of over $US 3 billion; its infrastructure and social services are in ruins. As a result of our pre-civil-conflict economic situation our ability to generate funds is impaired. We appeal to our friends to reconsider such impediments in order to allow us to tackle in a meaningful way the arduous problems of repatriation, resettlement and rehabilitation of our nationals scattered all over the world as refugees.\nInternational assistance becomes even more justified in view of the policy-reform programmes that Liberia has now undertaken. We seek to create the capacity of the democratically elected successor of the Interim Government to undertake reconstruction and stimulate socio-economic growth and development. We also seek to ensure efficiency and fairness in resource allocation, promote accountability and alleviate rural poverty. These policy-reform measures, in our view, constitute the steps necessary to attract the international assistance directly required to support programmes of reconstruction and assure the future growth of our economy. The Interim Government of National Unity seeks the cooperation of the international community to the fullest extent in reaching some understanding with respect to the critical problems resulting from the civil conflict and in laying the groundwork for self-sustained economic development in the years ahead. \nMeanwhile, Liberians look with great anticipation to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for continuation, for a reasonable period, of the humanitarian-assistance programme that they have provided daring our difficult period.\nAlthough we are preoccupied with our domestic situation, we are not un-mindful of those issues that continue to claim the attention of the international community.\nOn the African continent, Liberia welcomes the ongoing negotiations between the South African Government and the African national Congress. It is our hope that the hurdles preventing an early agreement acceptable to the parties will be removed so that all South Africans may freely participate in the affairs of their country on the basis of the principle of one person, one vote.\nWe are heartened by the progress being made with regard to Cambodia, El Salvador, the Western Sahara and Cyprus, owing to the willingness of the parties to reach accommodation. We hope that that willingness will eventually bear fruit.\nWe are alarmed by the recent developments in Haiti. We stand in solidarity with the elected Government, and people of Haiti in their efforts to prevent the reversal of the democratic process there.\nThe United Nations was founded on the basis of the high ideals of justice, peace and security. We must maintain those ideals if we are to bequeath to succeeding generations a more humane society. Such a society cannot flourish on greed, lust for power, and the flagrant abuse of human rights. Our appeal goes to the whole of humanity.\nWhile it is not easy to soothe the pains and shrug off the bitter memories of a protracted civil conflict - the worst in our history - Liberians must now muster the courage to move ahead, healing the wounds that have been inflicted upon ourselves, and act in concert with the rest of the world to uphold the noble ideals for which the United Nations was established - always remembering that \\\"In union, strong success is sure; we cannot fail.\\\"\n"

As well as being a tribute to your country - the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a founding Member of the United Nations, with which we are pleased to have long-standing and fruitful relations - your election is evidence of the esteem and respect that your outstanding qualities have won you in the United Nations.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, demonstrated his talents during the grave events that recently disturbed international peace and security. We are grateful and express our full appreciation to him.\nThis is an excellent opportunity to welcome warmly the bold and innovative initiatives of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, in the pursuit of international peace and cooperation, as reflected in the renewed authority and prestige of the United Nations. In this context, it is particularly fortunate that our Organization is welcoming new Members. Cameroon wishes to extend its congratulations to the Republic of Korea and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea on their admission. This is a significant step forward, which will certainly contribute to the lessening of tension on the Korean peninsula and will increase the possibility of a peaceful solution to the problems between these two countries, which are friends of Cameroon. \nWe also welcome Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, whose presence in our midst gives renewed vigour to the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination, as enshrined in the Charter of our Organization. Their admission is a source of profound satisfaction, and we extend our most heartfelt congratulations to them. We should also like to express our readiness to cooperate fully with Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, whose admission to the United Nations strengthens the universality of our Organization. May both States be most welcome among us.\nThe forty-sixth session is taking place after the triumph of law during the recent events in the Gulf and in the Soviet Union - two major events which, among others, fully reflect the breathtaking changes occurring in the world under the impetus of powerful trends in favour of freedom. This wind of change, which is conducive to a reawakening of nationalism and an affirmation of the irredentist tendency, is whipping up tensions within several States, North and South, whose stability is being severely affected thereby.\nThis is a decisive turning-point in the history of all humankind, a turning-point which brings with it serious and unforeseeable challenges which require us to work together to prepare the most suitable responses. Standing shoulder to shoulder in handling these common challenges and the changes to which they are giving rise, we should be able to cope effectively with them.\nIn particular, the new, general aspiration of all peoples without exception for progress should be examined from all aspects, because, for international peace and security, it would be an illusion to think that the end of East-West rivalry should lead only to the integration of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the world economy. In the East, as in the South, we see each day a forceful convergence of democratic values and the economic policies which are now universal; the resulting interdependence of hopes and expectations requires us to seek a new world equilibrium based on taking into account the aspirations and needs of all the component parts of international society.\nThe need to reconcile assistance to the countries of Eastern Europe and the imperatives of international solidarity for the struggle against poverty is today undeniably a profound obligation if we do not want the disappearance of the iron curtain to lead to the building of a stronger wall of poverty between North and South.\nIt is indeed true, as is stressed by the report of the South Commission, that every country is in the first instance responsible for its own development. Cameroon shares this position, and completely supports the new philosophy of development that this report advocates. Are we not, therefore, right to turn with hope to the international community for the creation of conditions conducive to the attainment of the objectives of the countries of the South, objectives aimed at lasting development based on collective self-sufficiency? How could we not appeal for greater fairness at a time when we see an international economic situation that places the developing countries at a disadvantage? Opposite the prosperous economies of the North are the crisis economies of most of the countries of the South, stifled under the burden of unbearable debt, which is aggravated by fluctuations in exchange and interest rates.\nIt is simply untenable for the net financial outflows from the poor countries to the rich to continue in a situation characterized by a decline in official assistance for development, increased deterioration in the terms of trade and a widespread and continuing collapse in the prices paid for raw materials. The social and political costs of the structural adjustment programmes our countries are applying so courageously seem only more exorbitant and difficult to bear as a result.\nThis is clearly not a problem which can be analysed solely in economic terms it is in fact a question of ethics, in particular as far as Africa is concerned, where we see the desperate situation of a continent being sacrificed. The eligibility of four more African countries for the category of least developed, which already covers more than two thirds of the States on the continent, is a sad illustration of this fact.\nOf course, there is now apparent a growing awareness of the need to tackle this situation, which is extremely grave, more forcefully. The measures to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest countries are part of this growing awareness, which is also reflected in a world-wide consensus on the actions and strategies to be implemented to overcome poverty and underdevelopment. Examples of this are the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation adopted by the General Assembly at its eighteenth special session, the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and the second Substantial Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries.\nThe evaluation at this session of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development should, as was so rightly proposed by the Secretary-General, lead to the adoption of plans to create conditions conducive to lasting development in Africa. It is therefore important that the commitments to give the necessary impetus to these alternative development approaches, which were undertaken by consensus, should be fulfilled.\nThe delegation of Cameroon welcomes the adoption, during the resumption of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, of resolution 45/264, on the restructuring and revitalisation of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields.\nThe summer session of the Economic and Social Council and, in particular, the special high-level meeting which was held during that session, revealed the limits of international cooperation for development and at the same time pointed to new prospects for strengthening it.\nThe restructuring process must continue in the spirit of resolution 45/264 so that the organisations in the United Nations system are given suitable structures and resources for development work. In so doing, the democratic principles which govern the functioning of our Organization must be maintained in order to avoid sidelining the majority of Member States from the management of world affairs, because we must not forget that only a dynamic synergy between the efforts of all the protagonists can promote the search for appropriate solutions to the major challenges of our time.\nIn this content, the international economic deadlines are of prime importance. A satisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round would mark the retreat of protectionism and would thus contribute to getting world trade moving again. We place the same hopes in the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as we do in the Secretary-General's proposal for the convening of an international conference on development financing. Because it is inspired by the same concerns, the Japanese initiative on the holding of a summit in 1993 on African development deserves to be warmly welcomed.\nThe progress made in the field of disarmament also gives us grounds to hope that additional resources will be released for development. Cameroon therefore wishes to commend the United States and the Soviet Union for the worthy efforts they have made to strengthen the international climate of detente, as reflected in the signing of the START agreements on strategic arms reduction.\nBecause of its boldness and scope, the very recent decision of the United States unilaterally to make significant reductions in its nuclear arsenal augurs well for international peace and security. He welcome that decision all the more warmly because of the interest it has aroused in the Soviet Union, giving the international community hope that the nuclear Powers will resolutely embark on the path of general and complete disarmament. The increase in the number of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons seems to offer an appropriate framework for achieving this objectives, for the greater good of mankind.\nIt is also fitting to thank the United Rations for the support it has given the Cameroonian Government's efforts to promote confidence-building measures among the members of the Economic Community of Central African States. In this respect, the adoption at this session of the conclusions and recommendations of the subregional seminar held in Yaounde from 17 to 21 June 1991 by the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs will make it possible to strengthen peace and security in the subregion. Likewise, South Africa's adherence to the non-proliferation Treaty constitutes an important step towards the conclusion of an agreement on the denuclearization of Africa.\nThe improvement in the current international situation is reflected in the favourable developments in certain regional conflicts. In regard to Cambodia, we welcome the presence among us of the delegation of that friendly country, which has been afflicted by a long and costly war and now sees the prospect of finally achieving national reconciliation. We hope that the Security Council's peace plan will be implemented and that Cambodia, reconciled at last, will be able to fulfil its destiny.\nFor the same reasons, we welcome the efforts towards peace and national reconciliation now under way in Angola and Mozambique. Cameroon also notes with satisfaction the cease-fire recently established among the parties directly involved in the conflict in Western Sahara. There is thus hope that a referendum will at last be organized, under the auspices of the United Nations, on the future status of that territory.\nRecent developments in the situation in South Africa raise the same hopes. The dismantling of the legal pillars of apartheid has not, however, eliminated tensions that give rise to inter-ethnic violence, or doubts about the will of the Pretoria regime to conclude an agreement on the establishment of a non-racial, democratic South African society. The international community must therefore remain alert to this new situation and relax its pressure only when the process of democratisation that has begun in that country becomes irreversible. \nMy delegation also welcomes the efforts made to convene a peace conference in the Middle East. We therefore urge all the parties involved to cooperate in good faith so that this exceptional opportunity to achieve peace will not be lost.\nIn other parts of the world where hotbeds of tension unfortunately persist, the virtues of dialogue must prevail over the logic of confrontation. Peace must be restored or consolidated in Liberia, the Horn of Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Cyprus. The involvement of the United Nations in the process of national reconciliation and democratisation under way in Central America reflects our Organization's renewed influence in crisis management and in the quest for negotiated solutions to local conflicts. The Secretary-General's efforts in that direction should be fully supported, as should the restoration of legitimacy in Haiti.\nThe planning and implementation of lasting development, taking into account the needs to protect the environment and the requirements of development, highlight the great importance of the environmental problem. The 1992 \\\"Summit of the Planet Earth\\\" must not only lead to a real charter for the Earth and the basic principles of nations' economic and environmental conduct for the next millennium, but also establish appropriate mechanisms to facilitate access by developing countries to financing and technologies that are necessary if they are to include ecological factors in their development policies.\nIn the social sphere, United Nations efforts to promote the struggles against AIDS, narcotics trafficking and drug abuse must remain central to the concerns of the international community. The same applies to actions undertaken with a view to involving women in the development process, as well as efforts to protect the handicapped, children and other vulnerable sectors of society. The holding of a world summit on social development and of the fourth world conference on women in 1995 will provide an opportunity to review all these problems at the highest level.\nNatural and other disasters that the world has increasingly faced should be given our complete attention. The devastating consequences of floods in Bangladesh and, more recently, in China emphasize the urgent need to increase the ability of the United Nations to react more consistently to these situations. It is to be hoped that the thought being given to this subject will result in solutions that will make it possible better to manage our urgent humanitarian assistance.\nWe are pleased at the progress achieved at the ninth session of the Preparatory Commission on the Law of the Sea concerning, inter alia, the registration of new pioneer investors and the establishment of a training group. But the States parties must demonstrate greater political will in order to protect the compromise reached in the 1932 Convention and its annexes that enshrines the principle that the resources of the sea-bed are the common heritage of mankind.\nThe aspirations of peoples to freedom and democracy are today inescapable demands. It is in response to the expectations of the people of Cameroon that the policy of renewal drawn up in 1982 by the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, has been developed in important ways. Thus, measures have been adopted for the establishment of a complete multi-party system, a general and unconditional amnesty, and the development of community life with participation by all. Conditions are today established for the various political trends to be expressed clearly within the framework of free and democratic elections. \nIn spite of upheavals linked to the profound democratic changes in our national life, the Government is sparing no effort to lead the entire country towards greater freedom, economic and social development and respect for human rights. Appropriate measures have been taken to avoid any mistakes that could jeopardize peace and national harmony and unity or that could jeopardize the safety of Cameroonian or foreign persons or assets.\nI want to stress that thanks to the political maturity and patriotism of Cameroonians, democratic developments in our country are moving forward at a satisfying pace. We appeal for understanding, trust and support from all people of good will so the process can be strengthened further.\nThe conclusions of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights will encourage our efforts in this field and will promote the universality of those rights.\nThe end of the cold war gives mankind a historic opportunity for reconciliation and for shaping the contours of a new international order. To be balanced, that new order must rest on the primacy of law and on world peace and security, as well as on a more effective international solidarity for development. Science and technology are making constant progress; along with the world's resources, they can make that objective attainable, so long as developed countries pick up the historic gauntlet of this challenge to us all and realize that their power carries with it the duty to act with justice and to be seen as just.\nHence, we think this is an excellent opportunity to permit other feelings to be expressed in the management of the United Nations. That is warranted not only because of our shared vision regarding solving the problems of our time, but also because of our shared determination to work towards a United Nations renaissance.\nThe African continent's readiness to place the creative spirit of Africans at the service of the United Nations reflects that united vision of our world and the concern for fairness that we all share. May it be given the support it deserves.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia most warmly on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I wish him every success in guiding our deliberations to a successful conclusion. May I also avail myself of this opportunity to express my delegation's appreciation to his predecessor, Foreign Minister Guido de Marco of Malta, for the excellent manner in which he presided over the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I should like also to pay a very warm tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. The United Nations has benefited greatly from his wisdom and dedication.\nThe founders envisaged this Organisation as a peaceful and universal family of nations. It is a great pleasure, therefore, to welcome the new Members in our midst - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania. Their admission has moved us even closer to the goal of universal membership of the United Nations.\nThe year under review has been marked by events extraordinary in sweep and importance. The vision of the Charter - a vision of a world of tolerance, of equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, a vision of social progress and better standards of life based on greater freedoms and the dignity and worth of the human person - is still far from becoming realised. But hopes have never been higher. A spontaneous wave of democracy, freedom and human rights is sweeping the world. A spirit of cooperation and mutual trust has replaced the atmosphere of confrontation that marred East-West relations for over forty years and rendered this Organisation ineffective. During the past year the world community has made it abundantly clear that aggression will not be tolerated, will not succeed and will not pay. This commitment to collective action has brought about a renaissance of the United Nations.\nThese important developments have given hopes to millions of people around the world. Nepal is proud to be a part of the global movement towards pluralistic political systems. A little over a year ago the people of Nepal joined hands in a mass movement for the restoration of multi-party democracy. This restoration of democracy has brought the King and the people of Nepal together in the process of nation-building. We are convinced that democracy, pluralism and human rights are indispensable for economic development. Our new Constitution has vested sovereignty in the people. Constitutional monarchy, a multi-party political system, an independent judiciary and a guarantee of all human rights are its hallmarks. The vigour and enthusiasm of the Nepalese people for the right to choose their government were amply demonstrated in the general elections held in May this year - the first free elections in Nepal in over three decades. Our new Government has started the process of consolidating the institutions of a liberal democratic society as outlined in the Constitution. The Government is committed to ensuring a decent standard of life for all citizens and to creating a society where all our people can exercise their rights and freedom to the fullest extent. To help us reach these goals, we look forward to greater understanding and cooperation from friendly countries and multilateral institutions. He place great value on our warm and cooperative relations with the countries in our immediate neighbourhood. With our neighbours in South Asia, we have joined in a cooperative venture under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to lay the groundwork of a grand vision of common benefit and an enduring relationship of sincerity and trust among all members. We cherish our friendship with all countries of the world and are prepared to cooperate to work for peace and security. Our commitment to human rights is enshrined in our Constitution, and we are determined to make human rights an important cornerstone of our foreign policy.\nAs the Secretary-General has noted in his annual report on the work of the Organisation, the world situation presents a unique juxtaposition of promises and perils. Dramatic events in Europe are the expression of the will of the people. The people's revolution has led to the dismantling of the iron curtain. It has enabled the three Baltic republics to take their rightful place among nations of the world. We welcome the move towards an integrated approach towards the solution of European problems. A dynamic Europe is vital for democracy and economic development world-wide. Nothing would be more unfortunate than for a united Europe to drift towards becoming fortress Europe. Paradoxically, the winds of change have also raised the spectre of nationalistic and ethnic strife. If allowed to fester, it contains seeds of destabilization with far-reaching implications. These flashpoints can be contained only through a scrupulous adherence to the norms of human rights and the rights of minorities. The solutions demand statesmanship of the highest order.\nOpportunities created by a new climate of international relations must be seized to resolve the Middle East crisis on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 336 (1973).\nA solution to the problem of Cambodia now seems within our grasp. We welcome the efforts of the Cambodian parties to implement the plan drawn up by the five permanent members of the Security Council for a comprehensive political settlement. We strongly support the role of the United Nations in the process.\nWe sincerely hope that the admission of the two Koreas into the United Nations will facilitate reunification through the peaceful efforts of the Korean people.\nWe welcome the important developments towards the complete dismantling of apartheid in South Africa. We appeal for an end to violence in that country, for violence can only jeopardise the goal of the eradication of apartheid. While supporting the determination of the majority population to bring lasting changes in South Africa through negotiations and peaceful means, we believe that the United Nations must continue to exert all possible efforts towards that end.\nWithout acknowledgement of the common interest in the survival of the human race, there can be no peaceful world. Without questioning the legitimate right to self-defence, we feel that the present obsession with military security is in fundamental contradiction of the avowed pursuit of a new international order based on law and justice. Therefore the international community mist press ahead with disarmament on a world-wide scale. A series of crises have dramatically illustrated the Importance of preventing the horizontal and vertical proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disarmament has to include all categories of weapons! nuclear, conventional and chemical. The progress in negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States gives us encouragement. Nepal welcomes the signing of the treaty on strategic arms reduction (START) and looks forward to a continuation of the process leading to deeper cuts in strategic arsenals. We welcome the decision of China and Prance to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a step which will greatly enhance the credibility of that vital cornerstone of nuclear disarmament. We reiterate our appeal for the early conclusion of a universal convention on the banning of chemical weapons.\nMany of the hopes of peoples in developing countries focus on economic and social development. The world political situation today presents an opportunity to deal with the interrelated economic, financial, monetary and trade issues as parts of a wider political process. The continued deterioration in the economic situation of the majority of developing countries is in itself a threat to international peace and stability. It is detrimental to the consolidation of democracy and human rights. It has become imperative to act urgently in the spheres of debt, trade and commodities and human resources development. Continued difficulties in the international economic situation have hit the least developed countries the hardest. Unless urgent measures are taken, it will be difficult to reverse their growing marginalisation in the world economy.\nThey need financial assistance and debt relief, combined with comprehensive plans for structural change. In this context, Nepal looks forward to full and expeditious implementation of the Programme of Action adopted by the Second United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries.\nEnvironment has become a major issue on the global agenda. The challenge is to find ways and means to enable developing countries to participate effectively in international environmental cooperation without, sacrificing their development imperatives. It is clear that the hugely varied problems of our environment can be tackled only if the world acts together. The 1992 Rio Conference presents a unique opportunity to rise above empty generalities and to adopt environmentally sound development strategies based on the transfer of adequate resources and technologies.\nIt could take years to understand fully the implications of the changes we have been witnessing in recent years. At a time when the pace of events is outstripping our capacity to adjust, there is a consensus that the principles of the Charter should govern the history-in-making, thereby ensuring a smooth transition to a stable and democratic world order. The unanimity in the Security Council in the face of the crisis in the Persian Gulf is a matter of extraordinary consequence for the future. It has upheld the principle of unconditional compliance with the rule of law. It also marked the beginning of a new phase in the application of the authority of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.\nWhile we welcome the convergence of views among the five permanent members of the Security Council on a number of regional issues of grave importance, we wish to underline the critical importance of ensuring that such agreement is legitimized by wider support from the international community.\nIn the light of the volatility of the present situation, the appeal of the Secretary-General that a renewed emphasis be placed on preventive diplomacy is most timely. The successful United Nations operations in Namibia and Nicaragua, the ongoing missions in Angola and Central America, the United Nations plan for a referendum in Western Sahara, the planned operation in Cambodia and the prospects in Afghanistan have added new dimensions to the possibilities of the world Organisation.\nThe fundamental importance of the peace-keeping operations has long been established, but an even more important aspect of United Nations involvement in peacemaking is rapidly emerging. Nepal remains a firm supporter of both the peace-keeping and the peacemaking activities of the United Nations. We believe that those must be based on a clear mandate and on the principles of cost-effectiveness, flexibility and efficiency. A sound financial basis is as important as the cooperation of the parties concerned. This requires a renewed commitment of all members to live up to their responsibility in carrying out a duly authorised peace-keeping and/or peacemaking operation.\nAs the vision of the Charter does not limit itself to the solution of political problems, the United Nations must play a role in the creation of a world where each individual has a right to a decent life. This involves a role in the search for global solutions to persistent widespread poverty, in the protection and preservation of the environment, in the fight against the scourge of terrorism and drug trafficking, and in the protection of human rights.\nIn the last analysis, the welfare of an individual human being is the ultimate reason for our common efforts to realize the ideals of the Charter. It is for the full realization of the rights and fundamental freedoms of each individual human being that we are engaged in the search for a democratic international order. The end of the ideological divide has created a unique opportunity to make human rights the fulcrum around which our commitment should evolve.\nTo turn the tide in matters like these - matters of peace and survival in decency - is a major undertaking even for a regenerated United Nations. But we cannot fail to take advantage of the sweeping changes that are making possible a renaissance of the ideas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the People's Democratic Republic of Laos, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Aware of your broad experience and your profound knowledge of international affairs, I express the hope that this important, forty-sixth, session will be crowned by particular success.\nI also take this opportunity to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Guido de Marco on his dynamic leadership of the work of the forty-fifth session and also to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, Secretary-General of our Organisation, on his energetic and tireless efforts to settle regional conflicts and to safeguard international peace and security in this new era world detente and cooperation. \nWe extend a warm welcome to the delegations of the new Members of our Organization, namely, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania.\nThe international situation continues to undergo changes. Generally speaking, a new era of peace and cooperation has begun, and the risks of nuclear confrontation have progressively lessened. The two great Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, have just concluded a Treaty on the reduction of strategic aims, and, along with the recent proposals made by the United States, this creates conditions favourable to the efforts of the nations and peoples of the world to promote relations of friendship and cooperation in the economic, cultural, scientific and technical areas, on the basis of respect for mutual interests and the principles of peaceful coexistence.\nWhilst the overall world situation has been marked by detente and the promotion of international cooperation, many uncertainties persist. The era of confrontation and of the cold war seems to be drawing to an end. The new world political order, which is intended to be just and equitable, does not yet seem to be clearly defined. Recent experience has shown us that peace, independence and the national sovereignty of peoples are far from being guaranteed, and, therefore, there is uncertainty in certain regions and fresh confusion in others. Certainly we want a new world political order - but an order capable of guaranteeing the legitimate interests of peoples. We also want economic cooperation between States, particularly between the developed North and the developing South, but it must be equitable. As for multilateralism and the United Nations, we feel that they need to be further strengthened, so as to be able to serve appropriately the legitimate interests and aspirations of the small, as well as the large, countries of the world. In my delegation's opinion, the United Nation's should play an important role also in the process of consolidating detente and cooperation and also in safeguarding and strengthening its Charter in order to guarantee the interests of all peoples. In this light, we should engage in consultations in depth so as to make our Organisation more democratic and adapt it to the new and changing realities of our world.\nAs we all know, the efforts to settle world and regional conflicts have yielded some fruitful results, thus helping to promote international peace, security and cooperation. However, many contradictions and conflicts persist in certain regions.\nIn South Africa, for example, the black population's struggle, under the leadership of the African National Congress, against repression and violence has taken on unprecedented scope, placing the South African authorities on the defensive in every respect and forcing them to negotiate. In spite of certain positive developments, the system of apartheid and its main foundations remain intact. It is incumbent on our Organisation to reaffirm its support for the struggle for the total elimination of apartheid and for the establishment of a united, equal society in South Africa in which all the inhabitants, without distinction as to race, will enjoy the same democratic freedoms.\nIn the Middle East the situation remains disturbing. Israel continues its occupation of the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories. If this conflict is to be resolved, it is essential that the interests of all the countries concerned be taken duly into account. In this regard, we endorse the initiative for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), of 22 November 1967, and 338 (1973), of 22 December 1973, and the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, particularly the right to self-determination.\nIn the Persian Gulf, the crisis that shook the entire region and the world was resolved, but not without difficulties. The State of Kuwait, a full-fledged Member of our Organization, has regained its independence and its territorial integrity. However, many post-war difficulties remain. All the parties concerned must therefore display greater restraint and strive to settle this problem by peaceful means, on the basis of equity and justice.\nIn Central America the peace process is continuing despite the obstacles which have arisen. The Government and people of Laos express their solidarity with the peoples of that region as they attempt to regain their full sovereignty and independence.\nIn the Korean peninsula the situation is still a cause for concern. However, the Lao People's Democratic Republic feels reassured by the progress made at recent meetings between high authorities of the two parts of Korea. The admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to the United Nations is another important step towards the peaceful reunification of Korea in accordance with the aspirations of the entire Korean people.\nIn West Asia, the situation is not free from tension. In the Republic of Afghanistan, the bloody civil war continues to rage. We support the wise and realistic five-point initiative of the Secretary-General aimed at settling this conflict. It is high time that all parties concerned express themselves firmly in its favour in order to put an immediate and to the civil war, achieve national harmony and agreement among Afghans and at last restore peace in the region.\nIn South-East Asia, there has been a general easing of tension. The countries in the region are increasing their contacts and further expanding their relations of cooperation in the economic, trade, cultural, technical and scientific areas. A new era of detente and cooperation has begun there and is now developing to the great benefit and in the interests of the peoples of the entire region. We are pleased by this new propitious and beneficial atmosphere prevailing in the region.\nAs regards the Cambodian question, a giant step towards an overall political solution has just been taken. The Cambodian parties to the conflict, at their recent meetings at Pattaya in Thailand, at Peking in the People's Republic of China, and at United Nations Headquarters in New York, reached agreement on an unlimited cease-fire, a proportional ballot for voting on the basis of provinces and so on. They are unanimous that His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk should assume the presidency of the Supreme National Council. The Laos Government and people sincerely welcome these decisions and hope they will provide a further impetus to the effort at achieving reconciliation among Cambodians and making Cambodia an independent, sovereign, peaceful, neutral and non-aligned country having good relations with oil countries, in particular its close neighbours.\nAs for my country, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the implementation since 1988 of its policy of renewal has seen the further expansion of its economic, trade, technical and scientific and other relations with the outside world. Within the context of this same policy, we are also carrying out a progressive restructuring of our administration in order to make it more relevant and better able to respond to the realities and new requirements at the national, regional and international levels. Thus several legislative texts - including the penal code; and the laws on labour, nationality, the family, property, inheritance and so on - have been prepared and other draft texts are now being drawn up. Quite recently the first Constitution of the Republic guaranteeing the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Lao people has just been adopted by the Supreme People's Assembly. We sincerely hope that the adoption of this fundamental law will lead to the progressive transformation of our country into a State based on law. In brief, we are now implementing this policy of renewal in all areas, with a view to the progressive enfranchisement of this developing country, the promotion of popular democracy in social life in all its aspects and the guaranteeing of political stability, order and social well-being. In this spirit, and moved by a burning desire to live in peace, our people will spare no effort to promote friendship with all peoples. It will continue to implement firmly its foreign policy of peace, independence, friendship and cooperation with all countries without distinction as to their political and social regime and on the basis of equality, mutual respect for independence and sovereignty and reciprocal advantage, thus contributing jointly with other peoples to the cause of peace, national independence, democracy and social progress.\nAs we all know, during the 1980s the overall growth of developing countries averaged 3 per cent annually, whereas during the 1960a and 1970s it was 5.5 per cent. Judging by these statistics, the last decade was marked by a fall in growth rates, lowered living standards and a rapid Increase of poverty. The developing countries have suffered extensively, and the 1980s thus saw the gap between rich and poor countries widening. Such was the very disappointing picture of the results of the past decade. As for the 1990s, major efforts should be made and everything should be done to make this a true development decade. In this light, the developed countries, by reason of their influence in the world economy, should do everything in their power to create a favourable international economic environment, without which the developing countries will quite likely be unable to solve their problems. Faced with serious problems of foreign debt, and given the pronounced deterioration in their terms of trade, the developing countries can make progress and, indeed, prosper only if the world economy's dynamism and stability are restored. The whole world would be more secure and more prosperous if together we could rid it of disease, poverty and hunger - in other words, underdevelopment.\nThe problem of illicit drug trafficking continues to pose a serious threat to the international community. In the struggle against this scourge the countries of the world - developed and developing - have cooperated in many areas, especially in that of integrated rural development whose goal is to encourage those who cultivate the poppy to choose progressively a substitute crop. In order to make its contribution to this international effort, the Lao People's Democratic Republic has cooperated in many areas with friendly countries and international organisations, including the United Rations Programme for International Drug Control, and states that it is ready to continue this cooperation.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the nations of this world are actively mobilising in favour of international peace and cooperation. In the face of this new reality, the United Nations has been accorded an increasingly important role in order to contribute effectively to this process and to meet the burning aspirations of the nations and peoples of the world. The States Members of our Organization - large or small, rich or poor - must cooperate with one another in the various areas on the basis of strict respect for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of each State and for the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of others and of reciprocal advantage. In this spirit, the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic assures the Assembly of its full cooperation; it will work in close collaboration with all delegations in order to contribute to the success of this forty-sixth session.\n"

Only the most outstanding diplomats can become eligible for that honour, which is conferred upon them once in a lifetime and for just one year. Yet today a single year may see historic developments that in the past would have spanned several decades. The proclamation by our Parliament of the independence of Ukraine and of the creation of an independent Ukrainian State was the culmination of the age-old aspirations of the Ukrainian people. The date of 24 August 1991 was a turning-point opening a new era in the history of Ukraine.\nUkrainians remain grateful, Mr. President, to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, who so ably guided the work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Last August he came on an official visit to Kiev and was the first foreign dignitary to welcome the proclamation of Ukrainian independence. We see that as a symbol of direct United Nations involvement in the sweeping process of liberation that has changed the face of the world in the second half of this century.\nI join those who have welcomed the admission to the great family of the United Nations of three former Soviet republics: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. I am convinced that their independent foreign policies within the United Nations will be vigorous and effective in promoting their own interests as well as those of the international community. I hope we will soon be able to welcome other republics of the former Union that may wish to become Members of the United Nations.\nI should like also to add our greetings to those extended to the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nThus, Mr. President, you are presiding over a session attended by a record number of Member-States almost all the nations of the world are represented in this Hall today. One cannot fail to notice many things that make this session different from the first session of the General Assembly, which gathered together the representatives of the 51 founding Members, including Ukraine.\nYet the substance of the Assembly's deliberations shows that in 1991, just as in 1945, Government representatives come to United Nations Headquarters spurred by the aspirations of their peoples to peace and development, security and cooperation, human rights and justice. Representatives to the United Nations from different States share a common concern for the future of humanity rooted in the concern of each of them for the future of his or her own people, family and children. Ukrainian children affected by the Chernobyl disaster were welcomed by families in France and Germany, the United States and Australia, Cuba and Finland, Canada, Israel and other countries. Hence, coming here today on behalf of a grateful Ukraine, I can confidently speak of a triumph of the lofty human ideals embodied in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. This is a source of hope for ordinary people.\nThe hungry from drought-stricken Africa, the suffering fleeing from areas of military, racial or ethnic conflict, the sick fleeing from the territories affected by the Chernobyl explosion: all of them look towards the United Nations with hope in their eyes and a plea in their hearts. The recent United Nations pledging conference and United Nations-sponsored measures to help the victims of other emergencies prove that the hopes the United Nations inspires around the world are not unfounded. This is particularly true at a time when the Organisation is, as is only logical, assuming a greater role as a universal centre for coordinating the objectives and actions of states: a time of revitalisation for the United Nations.\nLeaving behind the age of bitter ideological confrontation, we can finally dispense with the arms race, which has been so wasteful and, in a historical perspective, ruinous for humanity.\nThe implementation of the Soviet-United States Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces, the signing of the Treaty on a 30 per cent reduction in strategic offensive arms, the Treaty on conventional forces in Europe, and the considerable progress made in drafting an international convention to prohibit and fully eliminate nuclear weapons are landmark developments of recent history which we acclaim and will promote to the best of our ability.\nRabindranath Tagora, the great Indian thinker, said that the only way to get closer to the future was to advance towards it. The latest proposal by President Bush, supported by the leaders of the other nuclear Powers, for drastic cuts in short-range nuclear weapons is a significant step towards a more secure future. All initiatives which reduce the nuclear threat are wholeheartedly welcomed by Ukraine.\nWe think the United Nations should assist in extending the scope of promising reductions in military capabilities to all types of weapons and all regions and nations of the world, thus making it a universal process. In this way every country may assume its share of responsibility in world affairs, and the United Nations can alert every country to its responsibility. For each nation of the world has a sacred duty to contribute to the strengthening of international security through disarmament, through strict adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter and through faithful compliance with the relevant decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.\nUkraine for its part would like to become directly involved in the disarmament negotiating process. I believe it has a meaningful contribution to make to the solution of these problems.\nThe world community must not let the new opportunities presented today pass by. The non-proliferation of nuclear arms, other weapons of mass destruction and combat missiles and missile technology has become particularly relevant. Ukraine welcomes the declarations by France, China and South Africa of their decision to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. A situation is developing in which any State's intention not to adhere to the Treaty may be regarded as contrary to the common interests of mankind.\nWhat is the policy of Ukraine in this respect? As the Assembly knows, certain nuclear-weapon systems are at present deployed in Ukrainian territory. Our policy is that these nuclear weapons are only temporarily stationed in Ukraine. Eliminating them and the components of their deployment is just a matter of time. Last year our Parliament solemnly proclaimed Ukraine's intention not to participate in military blocs in the future and to comply with the three non-nuclear principles - that is, not to accept, produce or acquire nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency secretariat has been informed of our consent to place all nuclear facilities in Ukrainian territory under the Agency's control. Ukraine does not seek to possess nuclear weapons. It intends to become a party to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. This intention is in line with international efforts to reduce and destroy nuclear stockpiles throughout the world. By adopting this stand, Ukraine wishes to promote disarmament and greater trust among nations.\nLet me also take this opportunity to declare officially, in response to the General Assembly's appeal, that Ukraine does not produce chemical weapons, does not have them on its territory and will preserve its status of a chemical-weapons-free State. Ukraine welcomes the General Assembly's call on States to become original parties to the future convention on this subject.\nOn behalf of Ukraine, whose people have suffered the disastrous effects of the Chernobyl tragedy, as well as on my own behalf, I urge Governments, primarily those of the nuclear Powers, to display the political will at last to take immediate measures so that nuclear testing can be stopped for ever. I am confident that by concerted action we will be able finally to bring peace to the weary entrails of the soil beneath the test sites in Nevada, Mururoa and Novaya Zemlya, and all other places where nuclear explosions may still be rocking the Earth. It is time for us to complete the endeavour of our eminent predecessors who outlawed nuclear testing in space, in the atmosphere and under water way back in 1963. We can and must do this. Events in the Gulf have shown that the peace-making and peace-restoring power of the United Nations can prevail over any aggressor, without the back-up of nuclear explosions.\nRather than continue dangerously to waste their resources on terrifying arsenals of mass destruction weapons, the nations of the world must unite in order to settle existing regional conflicts, which sometimes tend to be regarded as incurable chronic ills of the second half of the twentieth century. We welcome active United Nations involvement in seeking peaceful solutions in the Middle East and launching the process of a negotiated settlement in Cambodia and Cyprus. We hail United Nations efforts to find a peaceful solution in Western Sahara. Security Council resolution 713 (1991), unanimously adopted last week, has charted a peaceful course towards solving the problems that divide the peoples of Yugoslavia.\nThe Organization and its Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, have spared no effort to initiate a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan on the basis of an international consensus reflected in the relevant resolution of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. If all those who can influence developments in that country were to give their earnest support to the peace-making efforts of the world community, missiles would no longer be raining down on Afghan soil and civilians in that country would no longer be terrified by machine-gun fire.\nA historical parallel comes to mind as we speak of sufferings inflicted on civilian populations. Precisely half a century ago, on 30 September 1941, loudspeakers had been booming for 48 hours on end in the Ukrainian capital, blaring forth music in a cynical attempt to drown the sound of automatic fire as Nazi troops were wearily shooting the last of the Jewish women, children and old people in Kiev. They were the first to be buried in the mass graves of Babi VuTt Nearly 200,000 other Jews, Ukrainians, Russians and gypsies shared their lot under the occupation. Our compassionate memory owes a tribute to all these innocent victims, without distinction. Today we can no longer accept the ideological approaches of the former regime in our country, which often ended in neglect for individual rights and the rights of entire peoples. We can accept nothing less than the entire truth about the Babi Yar tragedy, where Jews were the most frequent victims of mass executions. The international commemoration of the victims of the tragedy in Babi Yar, held this week in the city of Kiev, serves as yet another reminder of our duty to make sure that genocide never happens again anywhere on Earth.\nI would like to stress that today Ukraine has changed more than just the name of its country on its name plate in the Assembly Hall. It has made fundamental adjustments in its attitude to the tragic pages of its history and in its approach to a number of world issues. Thus, for example, it would have been impossible for the independent Ukraine to support, let alone co-sponsor, the resolution equating Zionism with racism - a resolution born out of a bitter ideological confrontation between the nations of the world. It is time for the United Nations to shake off the burden of the past.\nUnder the new circumstances top priority should be given to further consolidation and better use of the United Nations peace-making potential and to a comprehensive improvement of its organizational forms and functions.\nAt the same time, there is a growing need for preventive measures and international conflict-prevention mechanisms. This would also require some reliable United Rations system for quick and timely identification of potential sources of international tension.\nThe world is changing. The United Nations is changing along with it, never losing track of historic developments. As the Organisation approaches its fiftieth anniversary, we would welcome efforts to adapt it to new international realities. For example, this could include setting up a council of environmental safety, possibly to replace some bodies that have had their day. It is high time also that such anachronisms as a reference to \\\"enemy States\\\" be deleted from the United Nations Charter.\nExperience suggests that timely action to adapt to new realities increases the effectiveness of an organization. In our view the best way to increase United Nations efficiency is to make full use of the potential of the Charter for consolidating security and developing comprehensive international cooperation.\nWe have no doubt that the nationwide referendum to be held on 1 December will endorse the parliamentary move proclaiming the independence of the State of Ukraine. Our people will do this because of their infinite desire to keep the sinister past from repeating itself, because they wish to become masters of their own homeland and to ensure stability and peace in their society. Democratic Ukraine will do justice to the millions who fell victim to famine and terror under the Stalinist regime by ensuring that social and national oppression and the abuse of human dignity never recur.\nIndependent Ukraine will cherish the memory of hundreds of thousands of its fellow citizens who were driven along an agonizing path out of the country on accusations of nationalism. Never again will its citizens - Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Tartars, Poles, Hungarians - have to live in fear of persecution because of their natural love for their own culture, language or nation.\nIndependent and democratic Ukraine calls on all our compatriots in Ukraine and elsewhere to set aside old feuds and old bitterness, and, instead to work together for the noble cause of reviving the language, culture and statehood of our people, to bring back the glorious wheat-growing and spiritually creative traditions of our past, for - as our writer Oles Honchar once stated - it was not by force of arms that Ukraine asserted itself in the community of European nations.\nHaving announced our independence to the world community, we wish to declare that Ukraine has no territorial claims vis-\u00e0-vis any of its neighbours and in turn it categorically rejects any attempts whatsoever to address it in a language of territorial claims.\nUkraine reiterates its commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and confirms its intention to seek direct involvement in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process, and membership in the European bodies.\nThe Ukrainian Parliament was expressing the will of the people when, as early as last year, it declared that universal human values came before the interests of any social class, and that well-established international legal standards should have priority over domestic legislation. Our State will continue to give due protection to human rights on the basis of full respect for the individual and equal treatment of national minorities.\nThe Ukrainian Constitution ha3 been amended and supplemented to provide a solid legal basis for political and economic pluralism - yet another manifestation of our serious intentions and our efforts to establish a truly\ndemocratic society. The entire system of Ukrainian government is being overhauled to make it possible for democracy and a market economy to prevail in Ukraine.\nLet me say frankly that this is not always a simple task. Mastering the science of democracy does not come easily. We seek to emulate the positive experience of other nations. Whenever Ukrainian representatives in committees of the Assembly or in the Commission on Human Sights sponsor draft resolutions on matters of social justice, the rights of minorities or the development of democratic institutions, they seek, first and foremost, to test their perceptions of social values against the universal human experience accumulated by the United Nations.\nStill more important than recognition of principles is the record of implementation of those principles. We are aware of that, and therefore, as long as religious freedom in Ukraine is still at times misused to incite disputes and conflicts among those of different faiths, as long as the right of Crimean Tartars to live in dignity in the land of their ancestors cannot be fully exercised, as long as Jews in Ukraine are tempted to abandon the land of their forefathers and settle in Israel or elsewhere, as long as the Ukrainian language is not fully reinstated in its rights, as long as democratic laws and respect for the Constitution have not become standards of our thinking and practical action, we shall not hasten to tell the United Nations that our society has definitely done away with the errors and wrongdoings of the past.\nBut we would like to take this opportunity to declare solemnly before the United Nations and the entire world that independent, united Ukraine has irreversibly set forth on the path towards the rule of law, based on the principles of democracy and self-government, with law and nothing but law as the predominant standard of behaviour. We shall be guided by the\nhigh international standards in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms. And we shall follow this road every step of the way.\nThe newly independent Ukraine has begun to overhaul its entire economy, dismantling the command and administrative structures. Transformation of social and economic thinking, aimed at reducing State controls and promoting privatization and market relations, has been accomplished within a short period of time.\nThe law concerning economic independence, the concept of transition to a market economy, and the laws on free enterprise, foreign economic activities, protection of foreign investment and other fundamental statutory acts have established a solid legal framework for a sweeping restructuring of the Ukrainian economy and its incorporation into the international division of labour.\nOur new legislation in Ukraine guarantees equal legal protection to all forms of ownership and provides for an independent economic policy. This will mean, in particular, that Ukraine will introduce its own currency, develop its own budget, tax and banking systems, set up a labour, investment and securities market, put foreign economic relations and scientific and technological cooperation on a legal footing, and expand bilateral and multilateral ties.\nA radical reform in the Ukrainian economy does not call only for considerable domestic efforts: it also requires the promotion of foreign investment, increased cooperation and the use of the consultative assistance, know-how and experience that the international community has to offer. We welcome the attention paid by the United Nations to problems facing countries which, like Ukraine, are going through a period of transition. International \neconomic cooperation should be expanded to make full use of the potential created by the recent political transformations.\nA favourable international response would make it easier for the Ukrainian economy to overcome quickly the difficulties of transition and integrate itself into the international trade system. That would also be an encouragement for our young democracy.\nUntil quite recently, Ukraine used to live isolated from the outside world, haunted by hostile spectres born out of our own ideological dogmas. Cold war clouds cast over our heads a grim shadow of a global nuclear menace.\nIt was not until the world community began to assert universal values, discarded adversary attitudes and extended to us a helping hand and heartfelt sympathy in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, and until we proclaimed the independence of Ukraine, that we discovered a world of friends. The feeling is so exciting that I could not miss this opportunity of coming here today and paying respect to the United Nations, bringing words of gratitude to the world community on behalf of our free Ukraine.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPerhaps never before have we heard such optimistic words spoken here. Concern has been expressed for the future, of course, but faith in the future of mankind has also been expressed. There is renewed trust in this Organization and in its ability to fulfil the purposes and principles of the Charter. The President has been entrusted with leading the General Assembly at this crucial stage in its history. His wisdom and ability ensure a fruitful session. My country congratulates him and the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose name will be inscribed in the pages of the history of the United Nations and the history of the struggle for peace on Earth.\nHopes for lasting peace have been strengthened by the admission of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations. Paraguay is glad that the Republic of Korea has seen its dream come true of taking its seat in the Organization, as it has long wished to do. We hail and welcome the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which have now become Members in well-earned recognition of their long struggles for freedom and independence. We also welcome the Republic of the Marshall Islands ana the Federated States of Micronesia.\nAs I have said, mankind is now experiencing an extraordinary reaffirmation of its fundamental values. Peace, respect for inalienable human rights, freedom and democracy are no longer words with no meaning for most of the countries that are now preparing to embark on the adventure of building a new world. Building a new world requires new attitudes. Let us not replace ideological confrontation by economic confrontation. It would not be worth eliminating the threat of military conflagration if the threat of death from lack of medicine and food remained.\nWe trust that the end of the cold war will mark the beginning of the quest for a fairer social and economic order. It has been said time and again here that peace is more than the absence of war. To ensure true and lasting peace, the underlying causes of conflict must be eliminated. The end of the arms race, the relaxation of international tension and the rebirth of democracies and freedom will mean something only if they are accompanied by a firm resolve to help the most needy countries in their struggle for development. Liberalisation alone will not put bread on the table of the poor. This is the time for world solidarity.\nThis session is taking place against the backdrop of an international atmosphere that has never before existed in our Organization. It has had an extraordinary impact on international relations. This situation made it possible to react decisively to the Persian Gulf crisis, the most serious threat to international peace and security faced in recent times by the Security Council. He believe that an important lesson has been learned from the conflict. There is an awareness of the need, on the one hand, to control and limit all kinds of weapons; and, on the other, to strengthen the ability to take preventive action in order to discourage anyone who might be tempted to have recourse to the use of force.\nThis improvement in the international political climate shows that it is now possible to achieve appropriate solutions to challenges that earlier appeared out of reach; in our view, these include the conflict in Cambodia, the problem of Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East, to name only the longest-standing and most serious problems.\nOn Cambodia, recent events in the context of the peace plan of the five permanent members of the Security Council make it possible for that country to move forward to peace, national reconciliation and the restoration of sovereignty.\nWe are concerned at the continuing tense situation in the Middle East. Paraguay reiterates its support for the initiatives for a peaceful negotiated solution including the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within its own borders and the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of its own. Paraguay endorses the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and urges their implementation.\nWe reaffirm our support for the work of the Secretary-General that has enabled us to see the glimmer of a solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.\nWe voice once again our earnest hope that the good offices of the Secretary-General will lead to a solution of the Cyprus problem. The efforts of the Secretary-General and of the international community must be matched by the parties to the conflict if they are to come closer together and achieve a peaceful solution of the problem.\nProgress in South Africa towards the solution of that country's political problems is a harbinger of better days ahead in that region.\nPeace in El Salvador deserves a special, deeply emotional mention. All of America welcomes the good fortune of the Salvadoran people, and is glad to see the elimination of the few remaining conflicts in the region.\nParaguay looks forward to enthusiastic participation in the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference on the environment. Five hundred years after its discovery, America once again holds out the hope of a better future for mankind. My country will adopt concrete measures and will sign agreements on protection of the environment; we shall set aside a large quantity of our territory as a protected zone.\nToday the notion of development is indissolubly linked with that of preserving the environment. How is the time to create the conditions for more sustainable development. Our Government shares mankind's common desire for economic growth without destruction. Protecting the environment shows love for mankind.\nHe want a world without pollution, a world where nature is preserved, just as we want a drug-free society. Like the other countries of the hemisphere, Paraguay is committed to a frontal attack on drug trafficking.\nOne of the fundamental pillars of Paraguay's foreign policy is cooperation with, and support for, the endeavours of the various international organizations that are working to protect human rights. It is not economic or military power that lends prestige to a country; rather, it is the way in which its inhabitants enjoy to the full human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nSince the morning of 3 February 1989, when President Rodriguez declared the beginning of the democratisation of Paraguay and respect for human rights, my country's transitional process has been based on achieving democracy and on laying the foundations for the full enjoyment of human rights.\nA year ago in this Hall Paraguay spoke optimistically about its future. Time has proven us right. In the process of consolidating our democracy and our freedoms so much has been constantly achieved that we venture to believe that obscurantism and repression are things of the past; we look to the future with optimism. It is an undeniable fact that we are once again a part of the world of free nations; that encourages us to participate in the search for a fairer world social and economic order in which free enterprise (with a clear social component), democracy and freedom will promote sustained development with a view to ensuring a better life for our peoples.\nWe are pinning a large part of our hopes for development on integration, The Asuncion Treaty, which established the Common Market of the South (MEBCOSUR), was signed in our capital en 26 March 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and ray country. It reflects our common goal of achieving development through, integration. I can announce today that the parliaments of these four countries have now endorsed the Asuncion Treaty; 30 days after the deposit of the instrument of ratification the Treaty will enter into force. Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay will go down in history as countries able to take up the challenge of integration in a joint effort to secure better economic and social conditions and to strengthen freedom and democracy.\nMERCOSUR is not just a development strategy. It reaffirms the determination of our peoples to live in peace, cooperation and harmony. It responds to the call of history. It is the rediscovery of our political, economic, social and cultural identities.\nIn the contest also of international cooperation. President Bush launched the Enterprise the Americas plan, which is aimed at fostering better understanding among American countries through trade. The spheres of development, trade, investment and debt can help us promote equitable and beneficial relationships. To that end, and as part of a new relationship with the United States, the MERCOSUR Foreign Ministers and the Government of the United States signed the Rose Garden Agreement last June in the White House garden.\nMERCOSUR also has hopes for assistance and cooperation in its relations with the European Economic Community. At the Luxembourg meeting between Foreign Ministers of the European Community and the Rio Group, and at a later meeting in Brussels, foundations were laid for genuine rapprochement; there are plans for a joint cooperation agreement between MERCOSUR and the European Community.\nThe European Community's experience with integration, its economic and production capacity and, above all, its declared good will towards MERCOSUR augur well for a better future in our relations. For its part, Paraguay is near to signing a third-generation agreement in the context of cooperation with the Community.\nTalks with Japan and other Asian countries also promise better relations between Latin America and those countries. I must not fail to highlight the traditional friendship and spirit of cooperation that links Paraguay with the Government and the people of Japan.\nIn order to establish and maintain economic relations and to encourage in our country investment that stimulates development, we are negotiating agreements for the promotion and management of investments. In that context, Paraguay has entered into an agreement with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, an organ of the World Bank, to protect international investments.\nThe investment opportunities that Paraguay offers and the cooperation and participation of the more developed countries will help us to have a more effective presence in the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR).\nThe new winds of democratisation and the profound enthusiasm for freedom reached Latin America before they reached other parts of the world. The 1990s\n.ad America made up as never before of countries with democratically elected Governments. Integration and the spirit of continent-wide solidarity seen in the Rio Group arouse hopes for a great homeland. We congratulate the Governments of Argentina and Chile on the success of their agreements on the demarcation of their borders, and we again express our happiness at the prospects for peace in El Salvador. We very much hope that our America will once again be the continent of peace and hope.\nNext year Ibero-America and friendly countries will be getting ready to commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America. It took five centuries for the countries that make up the Ibero-American community to get together in a summit conference, in the hospitable city of Guadalajara. It was the first of a series of meetings of countries with the same cultural, political and religious identities, eager to work together for a common future.\nWe hope that there will be a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round negotiations. A policy of subsidies and protectionism is not compatible with a free-market economy not with the new international economic order that is supposedly being established.\nWe desire equitable trade negotiations and a better price for our products, as the proper way to bring about development. Democracy and peace cannot last where man lacks the minimum conditions for a dignified life.\nNowhere is more appropriate than the General Assembly of the United Nations for invoking continent-wide solidarity, good will and peace between nations. A United Nations ready to meet the challenge of new times is mankind's best means of bringing about the promising future that we see opening up before us. If we join forces and have good will, God will help us.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to extend warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nI am pleased to see you presiding over the deliberations of this Assembly during this period of fundamental changes in the international system. Your recognised diplomatic skill and your long professional involvement in the affairs of the United Nations will undoubtedly enable you to guide the work of the Assembly to its successful conclusion. You have my delegation's full support. The Kingdom of Thailand and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have enjoyed fruitful relations. We look forward to seeing the relations between our two Kingdoms deepen even further in the years to come.\nOur appreciation goes to the President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, for his untiring efforts in guiding the work of this body throughout the eventful year. During the tenure of his presidency, genuine interest was generated in revitalising the process of the General Assembly.\nIt is with great satisfaction that we welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea as full Members of the United Nations. Our warm welcome extends also to our Pacific neighbours: the federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We are also happy to welcome Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We congratulate them on the resumption of their rightful places in the family of nations.\nLet me extend our sincere felicitations to the members of the delegation of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The return of the Cambodian delegation to the General Assembly is testimony to the progress made in achieving genuine national reconciliation.\nThe events of the past few years have dramatically changed the international community. As it reeled from events of one drama, another - still more stunning - took centre stage.\nWe have witnessed fundamental changes in Eastern Europe. We are witnessing dramatic developments in the Soviet Union. In Europe as a whole we are witnessing concurrent movements towards integration and disintegration.\nIn the Persian Gulf we have seen how collective security can reverse aggression. With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, we are encouraged by the prospects for an international peace conference on the Middle East. Israel and its Arab neighbours, including the Palestinian people, may at long last coexist in peace. We are hopeful that the positive trends in South Africa will lead to an irreversible end to apartheid and the establishment of a democratic and non-racial society there.\nIn East Asia, with the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations, we look forward to further progress in the dialogue between Pyongyang and Seoul. We are also pleased to see the rapprochement between China and Viet Nam which has contributed significantly to the building of a peaceful environment in South-East Asia.\nPeace in Cambodia is finally at hand. Since the beginning of the Cambodian problem almost 13 years ago, Thailand has maintained all along that the Cambodians must be given the right to determine their own destiny. After a decade of war they finally decided to talk to one another. The Assembly may recall that it was His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk who first called for national reconciliation among the Cambodian factions almost 10 years ago. His appeal has been realized. No one has done so much for Cambodia as His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. He has shown himself to be the only Cambodian leader who can unify his country. The Thai Government will continue to render its fullest support and cooperation to him and to the Supreme National Council under his chairmanship.\nThe Supreme National Council of Cambodia has met twice in Thailand this year. It met once again with the five permanent members of the Security Council last month. The result is what the international community has been striving for - a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem.\nIn this connection my delegation would like to express its gratitude to the representatives of Indonesia and France for their able co-chairmanship of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia. We are pleased to see that the peace agreement will be signed by all parties concerned at the next meeting of the Conference to be convened in Paris on 23 October this year. Our appreciation also goes to the representatives of Austria, President of the International Conference on Kampuchea and of Senegal, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of that Conference, both of whom have made valuable contributions to the search for peace from the very beginning of the Cambodian conflict.\nThailand always stands ready to be of service to the United Nations in its important role in Cambodia. We are prepared to provide personnel who are familiar with the terrain and to offer other facilities close to the border. The Thai Government will render its full support to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) as it carries out its mandate with due respect for the sovereignty of all the States that border Cambodia.\nIn anticipation of the forthcoming elections in Cambodia my Government will also do its best to help ensure that an orderly repatriation of the displaced Cambodians will take place. All returnees must be assured that they can go home in safety and dignity. They should be allowed to participate in free and fair elections. In the post-Cambodian settlement, the Thai Government looks forward to contributing - together with the international community - to the reconstruction of Cambodia.\nThe breakthrough in the Cambodian problem gives rise to the hopes and aspirations of South-East Asians. For the first time since the Second World War, peace has come to South-East Asia. The positive winds of change that have swept through Eastern Europe and many parts of the world have finally arrived in South-East Asia. Countries, large and small, socialist and capitalist alike, have all concentrated on intensifying economic development and cooperation for the well-being of their own peoples.\nFor once a new regional order in South-East Asia will be charted by South-East Asians. It will be an order of peace, stability and prosperity if the countries concerned learn the lessons of the past. Now that peace in Cambodia appears imminent the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), having sought a political settlement in Cambodia for 13 years, should not be complacent but should continue to be instrumental in enhancing the stability of the region. With the apparently constructive role adopted by the major Powers towards the region, the South-East Asian countries should seize this opportunity to manifest their aspirations to express their right to shape the future of South-East Asia with their own hands.\nThe ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia offers a precise framework within which countries in the region can join hands to chart their own destiny, a destiny free of conflict and outside interference, a destiny of peace, stability and prosperity. It remains a great challenge for ASEAN to find a useful regional arrangement that will withstand the test of time and at the same time nurture the stability which is necessary for sustained prosperity. In this respect it is gratifying to note that Viet Nam has now formally expressed its intention to accede to that Treaty.\nMy visit to Viet Nam last month reaffirmed my conviction that Viet Nam wants to play a constructive role in the future of South-East Asia. For its part, Thailand would like to help Viet Nam to realize its aspirations. This coincides with the policy of the Thai Government of creating a peaceful environment for all neighbouring States. We are pleased to see that our relations with Laos, whose people share so much in common with ours, have become warm, cordial and mutually beneficial, for the good of our two peoples. We have every intention of strengthening further our cooperation with Laos in all fields.\nWhile Thailand seeks to foster goodwill and a peaceful environment with the Indo-Chinese States, it cannot afford to ignore its very important neighbour to the west. Over the past year developments in Myanmar have been of major interest to the international community. Due to its proximity with Myanmar much international attention has also been focused on Thailand's relationship with that State. We understand the legitimate concerns of the international community. The peoples of Thailand and Myanmar share religious, cultural and historical ties. Thailand is therefore in a unique position to understand the difficult internal situation in Myanmar.\nWe have been working closely with other ASEAN States on this matter. We are convinced that the decision of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers to adopt constructive engagement as an approach towards Myanmar is correct. Some States have asked ASEAN to isolate Myanmar. We believe that would not work. Nor do we believe it would be in the interests of the people in Myanmar. Through constructive engagement, ASEAN hopes to encourage Myanmar to make a peaceful transition towards becoming a society in a better position to fulfil its rightful role in the family of nations in South-East Asia.\nIt is a great challenge for Thailand to help to build a new regional order in South-East Asia. Meeting the ASEAN member in closest proximity to the non-ASEAN countries in South-East Asia, Thailand is in a unique position to extend a helping hand to Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. Through the creation of an atmosphere conducive to greater understanding and cooperation, Thailand and ASEAN will move closer to the realisation of ASEAN's objectives. He would like to see our neighbours enjoy peace and prosperity because they too have the right to contribute to the dynamic future of South-East Asia, a future that will truly embody ASEAN's objectives and, indeed, a new regional order of harmony and cooperation for South-East Asia.\nThailand's willingness to be of service to others extends beyond our own region. To give just a few examples, we were pleased to participate in the monitoring of elections in Namibia by sending 40 trained individuals. We were also pleased to participate in the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) and we have sent 50 United Nations guards to Iraq on a humanitarian mission.\nThailand has fulfilled all of its commitments to implement General Assembly resolutions in political, economic, social and other fields. We are delighted to take part in and contribute to the noble work of the United Nations.\nIn the same spirit of service, we are playing an active role in the war on drugs. Subregional strategies to control drug abuse have been devised through cooperation between Thailand and neighbouring countries. Indeed, it is the view of my delegation that it would be extremely beneficial if Laos and Myanmar would participate in triangular efforts with Thailand under the auspices of the United Nations to wage war against drug trafficking. On the international level, Thailand lends its Cull support to the strengthening of the United Nations system-wide coordinating mechanism. Thailand is a member of the International Narcotics Control Board and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and is pleased to have been re-elected to serve on the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs.\nIn enhancing stability and bringing prosperity to South-East Asia, ASEAN needs to be economically effective and credible. That is why my Prime Minister has proposed the establishment of an ASEAN free-trade area, a proposal that has been welcomed by all ASEAN member States. The idea is to work towards the gradual integration of ASEAN economies, leading to the establishment of an ASEAN free-trade area sometime around the beginning of the next century. By agreeing on the concept of an ASEAN free-trade area, ASEAN will be making a significant political decision that sets a clear objective for our economic integration.\nSuch a step will greatly strengthen ASEAN by putting it in a much better position to deal with other regional groupings and major trading partners. In this connection, Thailand believes that the East Asia Economic Grouping (EAEG), proposed by Malaysia, would be useful in furthering consultation and coordination among States in the region. It could serve as another vehicle for a more open international trading system.\nOur sense of the necessity to become economically stronger as a regional grouping is heightened by our determination to be able to participate fully in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Thailand looks forward to being the host country for the 1992 APEC Ministerial Meeting. With its adherence to the principles of free trade and multilateralism, APEC holds great promise for the next century.\nMow that differences in ideology are less prevalent in the work and discussions of international bodies, my delegation is hopeful that the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) will fulfil its mandate and receive the necessary support to strengthen regional cooperation and promote economic and social development among developing countries in the region.\nDuring the first half of 1990, we were hopeful that world trade would become freer and fairer as a result of the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. These hopes faded in the second half of the year, and the Uruguay Round failed to conclude in Brussels at the end of the year. Vital decisions on policy were left un-taken and they still have not been taken today. Talks have resumed, but serious negotiations cannot begin unless and until there is reasonable movement on the part of some trading partners to reform their agricultural policies, which have long distorted international agricultural trade, to the detriment of the majority of the world as a whole.\nIn this connection, I should like to appeal to the leaders of the States concerned to put the common good before narrow interests, for the sake of improving and liberalizing the multilateral trading system so that it can bring prosperity to all.\nWe are also concerned about environmental issues and we will do our best to protect the environment. However, we feel that the developed countries must bear most of the responsibility. Developing countries are forced to exploit their resources, so the developed countries need to identify new ways to make additional resources available. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June of 1992, should serve as a constructive forum for such commitments.\nI should like to pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar. The new international situation has placed the United Nations firmly on centre stage, but the revitalization of the United Nations would not have been possible without his leadership. He has put himself tirelessly at the service of the international community and he has given new vitality to the role of the Secretary-General, which in turn gives rise to a new-found, dynamic role for the United Nations in today's fast-changing world. The year 1991 begins a hopeful decade for peace and progress in many parts of the world. Thailand will do her vary best to contribute to a new world order - starting at home, in South-East Asia.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is both a pleasure and an honour for me to speak for the first time from this rostrum of the United Nations. I wish to express the congratulations of the Gabonese delegation to Mr. Samir Shihabi on his brilliant election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nIt is clear that his authority, competence and extensive experience of international relations, and in particular of our Organization, represent certain advantages for the complete success of our deliberations. I wish to include in these congratulations his predecessor, Mr. Guido De Marco, Deputy Prime Minister end Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, on the energy and effectiveness with which he exercised his functions and which today earn him the recognition of our Organization.\nI wish also to pay a heartfelt tribute to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for the invaluable work he has carried out at the head of our Organisation for the past decade. His intelligence and dedication will Indeed considerably strengthen the credibility and prestige of the United Nations.\nLastly, allow me to welcome the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Baltic Republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The admission of these new Members confirms once again the universal mission of the United Nations.\nRest assured that the delegation of Gabon, which I have the honour to head, is motivated by a constant desire to ensure that this session will lead to positive results.\nWe surely all have the impression of witnessing an acceleration of history, for the events of recent months have profoundly challenged the major balances that emerged from the Second World war. Let us have no illusions; this is no longer a challenge. These are models which have collapsed and collapsed abruptly.\nLet us not rejoice in the failure of some because the threats and imbalances are still evident, not only between the North and the South but also in societies that are referred to as developed.\nDialogue, joint discussion and solidarity are particularly necessary. This is the price for our avoiding the third millennium being an age of confrontation.\nHowever, the end of the cold war and the \\\"policy of blocs\\\" had bean generally perceived with euphoria as real progress of democracy and freedom in the world and as ushering in an age of peace and security. Unfortunately, the many upheavals which occurred in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have, since then, disappointed the great hopes resulting from this evolution. Among all these conflicts, the Gulf conflict, more than any other, has profoundly called these hopes into question. That is why my country welcomes the restoration of the sovereignty of Kuwait and the efforts made by the international community to that end.\nIn this connection, the search for an overall settlement of the problems in that region, based on respect for the rights of all, is necessary. This does not depend only on the will of the peoples and States of the region. It must commit all those who, for various reasons, have an influence on the behaviour of the different protagonists so as to bring just and lasting peace to prevail in the world.\nWe must have a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, in the settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict and the question of Palestine, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Gabon wishes to reaffirm its support for these two resolutions and fully endorses the idea of holding an international peace conference on the Middle East, which should lead to negotiations among all the parties concerned.\nAlong the same lines, Gabon welcomes the prospects opened by the restoration of security in Lebanon.\nWe must also have a just and lasting peace in Africa where this year the increase in civil war and internal conflict has led to an increase in problems facing the people of our continent. For example, over the past two years the daily lives of innocent individuals in Liberia nave been profoundly disrupted and many refugees have fled to neighbouring countries. Gabon sincerely hopes that peace will be restored, along with security and stability in that fraternal country. We welcome the efforts made to that end by the member countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\nThe same applies to the situation in the Horn of Africa. People in that subregion are helplessly suffering from the effects of shortages of rainfall and conflicts which have set their world afire.\nOur concern for peace and security can be seen again in the unreserved support which Gabon has extended to all the efforts undertaken to solve the problem in Angola. It is appropriate here to reiterate the total support of my country for the efforts undertaken on behalf of national reconciliation and, in this connection, to welcome the signing of the Estoril Agreements on 1 May 1991 between the Government of Angola and UNITA, under the auspices of the Portuguese Government.\nThe conflict in Western Sahara appears to be evolving in a positive way and the Government of Gabon welcomes with satisfaction the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 690 (1991) on the referendum. We believe that this is a decisive stage on the path to a definitive settlement of the conflict.\nWhile welcoming the fact that the three main pillars of apartheid in South Africa have been removed, Gabon has not forgotten that the principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\", does not yet prevail in the political life of that country. That is why the Gabonese authorities reaffirm their unconditional commitment to this universal principle which South Africa must respect.\nWith regard to the latest developments in that country, Gabon welcomes the conclusion of the tripartite peace agreement and appeals to the contracting parties to apply the provisions so that a new democratic and multiracial South Africa can emerge.\nA just and lasting peace is also necessary In Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Afghanistan. With regard to Cambodia, in particular, encouraging signs of a return to peace have emerged in recent months. In this respect, we welcome the progress achieved at the Pattaya Conference in Thailand. The process initiated during that meeting to find a peaceful solution should be resolutely pursued so that, at last, a global settlement can be reached guaranteeing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia.\nIn Latin America, Gabon is extending its support to the peace process initiated under the auspices of the United Nations for the restoration of security and stability In that region.\nHe support a just and lasting peace in Europe, because we are very concerned about the tensions and conflicts which are growing in Central and Eastern Europe and which are endangering international peace and security. Gabon is following very closely the developments taking place in Yugoslavia, a country with which we are still bound by excellent ties of friendship and cooperation. That is why I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the mediation efforts of the European Economic Community to find a peaceful solution to this conflict, because, here as elsewhere, disputes must be solved through dialogue.\nGenerally speaking, therefore, one could say that the end of the cold war and of the \\\"policy of blocs\\\", which I have just mentioned, should favour the restoration of just and lasting peace throughout the world. As the spectre of the confrontation of blocs, which originally gave rise to the accumulation of the most murderous weapons of mass destruction, moves into the background, we can envisage the implementation of the programme of action adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.\nBeyond this regional analysis, a number of problems concern the international community as a whole. Actually, a number of very serious problems still threaten the balance of our planet. For example, just to mention a few, there are the problems of drugs, AIDS and of the deterioration of the environment. In the context of the struggle against drugs, my country, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries, has established a central office to combat drug abuse and a team of toxicologists at Libreville, which is regional in nature. The same is true of the drive to combat AIDS. Gabon, with the assistance of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Programme, has prepared a medium-term plan. However, we feel that a global approach to these problems would enable us to find answers to these problems which threaten the future of mankind.\nWith respect to the environment, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is to be held next June in Brazil, will afford an opportunity to show that our Organization can be effective when it is mobilized for a lofty cause. But here and now, my country, which has one of the largest forest reserves in the world, feels that the solution to environmental problems must take duly into account the requirements of development in all their aspects, and in particular the regional social and economic situation.\nEncouraging measures taken in this way to combat these problems, namely, drugs and AID8, together with the protection of the environment, and the reduction of regional conflicts, cannot be dissociated from efforts to combat the serious disparities which still characterise international economic relations. To date, the economic and social situation of Africa has deteriorated dramatically, despite the many programmes and reforms adopted, for example, the Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa from 1980 to the Year 2000, or the United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Restructuring and Development of Africa.\nThe first consequence of this situation is Africa's inability to implement true Investment programmes which would help to revitalise its economic growth and development. He need only note the results of the recent work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Final Review and Appraisal, which did not come up to our expectations. Moreover, international financial institutions have advocated the establishment of structural adjustment programmes. Unfortunately, these entail social costs which have adverse effects for our people. The fart that these programmes aid accompanied by social claims related to the liberalization of African political system, considerably intensifies the difficulties which the Governments of African countries are facing.\nThe improvement of the economic situation of our continent, therefore, must be achieved through the restructuring of international economic relations, which takes into account not only the interests of the North, but also those of the South, especially the constant decline in the price of commodities and the burning question of the debt. That African debt, which today stands in excess of $270 billion, should be the focus of solutions by groups of countries - such as middle-level-income ones - which have so far not been the object of any relief measures. We know that the international community has the necessary resources to do this. The establishment of institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development of Eastern and Central Europe is eloquent proof of what can be accomplished given determination and political will. Aspects related to rescheduling that debt should also be examined in future consultations.\nIndeed, the path that lies before our countries today, the path of greater freedom and democracy, can only buttress the concept expressed in the world Report on Human Development recently issued by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which recommended\n\\\"a participatory form of development in which the human person would be at the heart of the decision-making process.\\\"\nWe wish to state at this stage that the North, which has no interest in seeing Africa marginalised in the new world economic order, must help in its development in order to ensure that the process of democratisation under way in our countries may continue and become irreversible.\nAt the dawn of the next millennium, the challenges of tomorrow's world, like those of today's, must be met by all of us; they require us to coordinate our efforts so that we may draw ever closer to the Organization's goals. This is particularly necessary because new generations will judge us by the way in which we have met the major challenges of today and helped to solve those of tomorrow. In this connection Gabon sincerely hopes that at this session Member States will make a firm commitment to revitalize international cooperation and to strengthen dialogue and peace among nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure to extend to you, Sir, at the outset of my speech, the sincere congratulations of the delegation of the State of Bahrain on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is a source of delight and happiness to see a distinguished diplomat from our sisterly kingdom of Saudi Arabia assume this lofty post; it is evidence of the high esteem in which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is held in the world and of the appreciation and respect you enjoy in the international community. I am pleased to express to you our best wishes for success in directing the proceedings of this session.\nI should also like to express our sincere thanks to Mr. Guido de Marco for the competence with which ha guided the proceedings of the General Assembly during his presidency last session. I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the untiring efforts by Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, to strengthen the role of the Organisation in the maintenance of peace and security in the world, and of the sincere attention he paid to the Gulf crisis, which enabled the world Organisation to promote global solidarity and uphold international legality.\nIt is also my pleasure to offer congratulations to the delegations of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on their accession to membership of the United Nations. He are sure that their admission into our Organization will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Charter.\nFor a year now, world events have been unfolding in quick succession. It is rather difficult for the observer to plumb the depths of their significance at first glance due to the fact that those events are so interlaced that they resemble the intermingled light and darkness in the early hours of the dawn of a new day. Faced with such astounding developments, the idea of a new world order has become the topic of discussion in many international assemblies and political forums, particularly after the bastions of the cold war have crumbled and their memory has begun to fade in the pages of history.\nThere is no doubt that the cold war, with its various implications, left its imprint on the period front 1945 to 1990. With its and, international relations no longer follow a particular pattern; they are neither bipolar nor multipolar. It is to be hoped that the unfolding of events at this heightened tempo will make us pause, contemplate and ponder the movement of history and the paths it charts so that we may find our way to the future.\nIt is hardly surprising when one pauses and ponders such major changes in search of the batter future which alluded previous generations, that one aspires to carry out those projects of which mankind dreams and explores the common denominators which impel nations towards cooperation, rapprochement and harmony. It is at such critical moments in history that mankind needs a new vision with which to see the world in a true light, and from a multidimensional perspective based on the fact that international policy will yet again turn round the axis of a new pattern of relations that requires the development of a set of sophisticated plans to deal with the global issues of security, the environment, natural resources, population and other problems which will be influential factors in the twenty-first century.\nWe believe that the structure of the new world order should be based on the following essential foundations: security; development in all its aspects; and interaction between cultures and civilisations and exchanges between the States and peoples of the world. It is imperative that this new structure should include a competent international authority, which should oversee all the systems within the United Nations framework.\nThe new system of world security must revolve around two main axes, the international and the regional. However, the most important point on which to focus at the international level during the coming phase is the development in the United Rations of a concept of collective security that would rest on two cornerstones:\nFirst, the prohibition of the use of force or the threat of the use of force in international relations for any reason whatsoever, as set out in the provisions of the Charter (Chapter I, Article II (4)).\nSecond, a collective response by the international community, represented by the Security Council, in cases involving threats to peace, breaches thereof or aggression, in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.\nAs we perceive it, the application of collective security requires us to meet several conditions, the most important of which are:\nFirst, viewing peace as one indivisible whole. Given the intricacy and diversity of international relations, the outbreak of war between two States can affect the interests of other States. Under the system of collective security, all States would have a legal and moral obligation to participate in deterring aggression everywhere in the world and restoring peace.\nSecond, the neutrality and objectivity of the system of collective security, in the sense that measures would be taken against the aggressor State regardless of its identity or whether it was strong or weak, rich or poor.\nThird, the global character of the membership of the system of collective security. All peace-loving States should participate in the system so as to ensure its universality and effectiveness.\nFourth, the machinery of the system for enforcing collective measures should be potent and effective enough to deter any country which may contemplate aggression and to inflict appropriate punishment on aggressors.\nAs regards the regional axis of security, it should be borne in mind that every State, irrespective of its size or economic means, has vital security concerns that are inherent to its history and geographical location. Each State also has a legitimate right to protect its national security. Thus, we view the question of security in the Gulf region from a multidimensional perspective designed to assimilate the lessons of the past, satisfy the needs of the present and avoid the dangers of the future.\nThe Iraqi occupation of the sisterly state of Kuwait uncovered a serious flaw in the concept of regional security in the Gulf, which compels us to search deliberately for means of deterrence to protect ourselves against the evils of the adventurous and the covetous in order to prevent them from undermining the stability and security of this sensitive part of the world. Here, I recall the words of George Santayana, who wrote, \\\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\\\". He are resolved never to relive that bitter experience, no matter what the reasons or the circumstances.\nThe war for the liberation of Kuwait drew a dividing line between the end of the cold war era and the start of the era of the new world order, which began with the repulsing of the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, on the principles of collective security. This, however, does not mean that all possible threats of the use of force have been eliminated with the termination of the cold war. In this context, our recommendations for the future components of regional security in the Gulf are as follows:\nFirst, security arrangements capable of deterring any aggressor should be used to avert any potential threats.\nSecond, earnest action to achieve comprehensive economic, social and cultural development. This is an essential prerequisite of the national security of all the States of the region.\nThird, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and respect for the principle of the sovereignty of every state in the Gulf region over its natural and economic resources.\nFourth, adherence to the principle of settlement of disputes by peaceful means alone.\nAt the same time, our conception of security in the Gulf region takes into account the geographical and political dimensions of the Middle East, since it is impossible to effectively buttress security along the shores of the Gulf without us all having a clear picture of all dimensions of security issues in the neighbouring States of the region.\nIn the previous session, I reiterated our conviction that the Middle East should be proclaimed a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, specifically nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Today, we are even more resolved to achieve this goal because of our belief that international security is intrinsically linked to its regional constituents and our conviction that strengthening the security of the Middle East region by making it completely free of weapons of mass destruction will be a positive contribution to the maintenance of world peace. On the other hand, proclaiming the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction would turn the attention of its States to the question of economic, scientific and technological development and lead them to cooperate in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\nThe second foundation for the structure of the new world order is the fact that development and security are closely and inseparably linked. The founders of the United Nations ware aware of the dialectics of the linkage between development and peace and explained the extent of that association in the provisions of the Charter. When peace is threatened, the march of peoples towards a better tomorrow is obstructed, the individual is denied his daily needs, and the gap between the poor and rich widens, leading to increased tensions between States.\nEmphasis on economic considerations and their relationship to the problems of peace and security in the world should gain the attention of the international community, and States should become more aware of the concept of collective economic security. The main objective of development is to satisfy human needs and aspirations and to eliminate reasons for denying the individual his right to economic well-being.\nUnfortunately, the world suffered during the past year a marked reduction in economic growth. Horse still, the United Nations, in its world economic survey of 1991, expected the rate of world economic growth for this year to be zero. In the light of such trends, both the developed and developing States should cooperate within the framework of the United Nations to overcome the negative aspects of the world economy and stimulate equitable growth in the economies of the developing countries so as to reduce tensions in the world.\nOne of the most important issues related to development is that of the environment, which has lately come to the forefront of international concerns. Climatic changes, pollution of the air and the sea, desertification and the depletion of the ozone layer all have negative effects on mankind's present and future. The war in the Gulf added new dimensions to the problem of tampering with the environment when the Iraqi forces leaked oil into the waters of the Gulf and set fire in Kuwait to some 732 oil wells that blazed for several months, and in fact many of them continue to burn despite all efforts to extinguish them. \nWe hope that both the world economy and the environment will soon improve through the ongoing constructive dialogue undertaken within the framework of the United Nations system. He trust that the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to be held in Colombia in February 1992, and the third United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, scheduled to be held in Brazil in June of that year, will lay the groundwork for international accord and cooperation to solve those problems.\nThe third foundation of any new world order is the necessary cultural interaction between the peoples of the world. Now that mankind has no other way of progressing and developing but to cooperate and achieve harmony between peoples, the time has come to give this issue the priority it deserves and to draw attention to its various human dimensions. Any person who knows his history must know that, over the centuries, States crumble and civilizations disappear after they had made great strides on the road to progress and advancement. Today, however, science and technology have brought together nations and peoples from various parts of the world and made isolation a non-starter in a world of interwoven interests that is closely knit by the modern means of communication and the activities of giant transnational corporations whose arms extend to every part of the globe.\nThroughout history, disparity and differentiation among peoples have often led to conflict and war, making rivalry and hostility the predominant characteristics of relations between States motivated by narrow self-interest. Now that wars have become an even more heinous evil, we are duty bound to find a way to eliminate the conflict between cultures and to draw them closer together. Because wars begin in the minds of men, we should embark on establishing peace education, promoting the concept of the interrelationship between the cultures of the world and erasing the motives for war from people's minds.\nAt a time when the United Nations is seeking to create a more balanced and just world order, it is imperative that no particular culture should look down from a position of dominant strength upon the cultures of other nations. This requires a more profound dialogue between cultures in a new spirit inspired by the recognition of the co-equal cultural interrelatedness of all the peoples of the world. This pattern of relations between people is inspired by the teachings of the holy Koran, which exhorts humans to seek harmony and affinity among themselves, as in the words of the Almighty:\n\n0 mankind! We created You from a single (pair) Of a male and a female. And made you into Nations and tribes, that Ye may know each other Not that ye may despise (Each other). Verily The most honoured of you In the sight of God Is he who is the most Righteous of you. (Sura XLIX. verse 13)\nThe events which have taken place in the international arena since the General Assembly's last session embody numerous indicators that point at a tendency to peaceful solutions to many international and regional issues and problems. Of particular interest is the matter of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war detained in Iraq, because it bespeaks defiance to Security Council resolutions and international conventions. We appeal to the international community to move towards a speedy solution to this humanitarian problem, freeing those prisoners forthwith and repatriating them safely to their homeland.\nIn the forefront of other international issues is the question of the Palestinian people and the various kinds of repression it continues to suffer at the hands of the Israeli occupation authorities. At the heart of the peace process in the Middle East is the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination. He therefore call upon the Security Council to impose international legality, elaborate the bases for peace between all parties concerned in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and take a firm and serious international stand that may force Israel to accept a comprehensive and just solution to the question of Palestine, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions, and to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to establish its own independent State on its national soil. It should be emphasized that the Israeli occupation forces must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories, including Al-Quds, southern Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Golan.\nWe hope that the current United States initiative and other efforts exerted in the international arena will contribute to creating an atmosphere conducive to holding the peace conference and reaching a just and lasting solution to the Middle East issue.\nAs regards Lebanon, we call upon the international community to support the decisions and actions taken by that country's Government to firmly establish the rule of its legitimate authority. We also appeal to the Security Council to take action on implementing its resolution 425 (1978) by ensuring the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese State and its sovereignty over southern Lebanon.\nWith regard to the situation in South Africa, this year has witnessed positive steps towards repealing the policies of apartheid. We trust that this will be followed by the complete elimination of all manifestations of social discrimination and the restoration of the political and constitutional rights of the black majority in South Africa.\nConcerning the Cyprus question, we hope that progress in the talks between the two Cypriot communities, under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, will be achieved so that Cyprus can regain its unity.\nWe look forward to seeing the countries of the world cooperating with each other through the United Nations. May their cooperation in peaceful areas expand and surmount all obstacles and barriers so that international solidarity may be strengthened and harmony among the peoples of the world may prevail. Obstacles of all sorts have not been able to halt the spread of knowledge to all parts of the world, and history teaches us that learning and knowledge cannot be isolated or made the exclusive realm of one particular region or State. The technological revolution has enabled man to overcome those barriers, and technological innovations have had a far-reaching influence on bringing peoples together and making every people feel itself an integral part of one big interrelated society and that its interests are affected by what happens to other peoples.\nOn the level of international relations, the United Nations is truly the most important expression of this age and one of its salient features. As the world Organization follows the path charted for it, the bonds of interrelation between States grow stronger and people's perception of the fusion of their interests increases.\nThe survival of the United Nations as an edifice of world peace and its continued fulfilment of its mission are no longer subject to the will of one State or group of States. They now flow from the noble message the United Nations upholds and the great missions assigned to it, which are expanding daily to include various fields, such as the means to bring States closer together, the maintenance of peace, and the well-being of the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour for me to address this Assembly, both as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and as the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In those capacities. Sir, may I congratulate you on your election as President of this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election is undoubtedly a great tribute to your talents and a recognition of the contributions of your country to furthering the ideals of the United Nations. I am confident that under your able guidance the deliberations of this session will be brought to a fruitful conclusion.\nI wish also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the last session.\nI would like to express my profound appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who for the past 10 years has put his sterling qualities at the service of our Organisation. His outstanding contributions as an advocate of peace and his support for the cause of the underprivileged have endeared him to the international community. As his terra of office draws to a close, I wish him good luck in his future endeavours.\nFrom a membership of 51 in 1945, the United Nations has grown to an Organization of 166 States with the admission at this session of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. I join in the welcome that has been extended to them.\nIn the four and a half decades of the existence of the United Nations, the prospects for building a safe and secure world for all mankind have never been brighter. The end of the cold war, the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, the encouraging agreements concluded by the United States and the Soviet Union in the field of nuclear disarmament coupled with the latest unilateral measures announced by President George Bush, the progress achieved in the resolution of regional conflicts and the growing convergence of views on democratisation and its linkage with development have all combined to create a climate more conducive to genuine international cooperation.\nThe challenge to the international community, therefore, is to seize this opportunity to establish a new world order in which the United Nations will be the instrument for the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, for the harmonization of the interests of all States and for the promotion of global prosperity. This new world order must be collectively defined, collectively designed and collectively defended.\nAfrica, like other parts of the world, is adjusting to recent dramatic global developments. Our peoples are taking a critical look at the conduct of politics and the changes necessary to bring about stability, security and development. For that reason, the issues of democratisation, of human rights and of popular participation in political and economic processes have assumed important dimensions in the deliberations of the OAU.\nIn June 1991, the OAU, at its summit meeting in Abuja, the new Nigerian capital, deliberated again on these issues. The summit resolved that African countries should fully embrace the democratic culture in order to enable our peoples to enjoy fundamental human rights and participate effectively in decisions that affect their lives and their well-being. Naturally, models of democratisation must vary and must take into account differing cultures and other environmental factors. Each country is therefore evolving its variant of democracy at a different pace of development.\nIn Nigeria, for example, the Transition to Civil Rule Programme is a carefully phased process in which democratic government is expected to proceed with political learning, institutional adjustment and the reorientation of political culture. By the end of 1992, we will have held elections to all tiers of Government and completed the transition programme that was launched in 1986. Other approaches to democratisation, especially the National Conference variety, have entailed the rapid displacement of incumbent managers of State by transitional leaders who, in turn, will commence the process of transition.\nEconomic development nurtures democracy. However, underdevelopment is a threat and obstacle to democracy. We commend the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union for their decision to build democratic societies. We also note the significant financial and economic assistance that the Western industrialized countries and Japan have decided to offer them. This is in direct contrast to the virtual neglect of African efforts. If this neglect and this indifference continue, disillusionment may arise with democracy in the face of persistent and extreme economic hardship.\nAware of this inter-relationship between democracy and development, many countries in Africa are pursuing economic reform side by side with the restructuring of the political processes. Self-reliance is the cornerstone of our new thinking on economic reform. At the individual country level, we have embarked upon structural adjustment programmes designed to liberalize our economies. Through deregulation, we expect the private sector to play the leading role in revitalizing our economies. At the continental level, at our summit meeting, held in Abuja last June, we adopted the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community, with the objective of creating an integrated common market. Our goal is a fully developed Africa, able to feed itself, capable of being the engine of its own growth and able to participate actively in the world economic system. Structural adjustment in Africa, without a conducive international environment, seems incapable of turning our economy around and ensuring the stability of our polity. It must be said that Africa's efforts have not received the requisite international support.\nMay I recall that in June 1986 the United Nations adopted the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which covered the period from 1986 to 1990. A review of the Programme showed that its implementation was most unsatisfactory. Hence, the overall performance of the African economy since 1986 has been dismal. The reasons can be attributed mainly to the debt burden, the collapse of commodity prices, the low levels of resource flows from the developed countries, as well as natural calamities.\nDisappointed by the poor performance of the Programme of Action, African countries decided to present a New Agenda of Action for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, rather than approach the international community for a second programme of action. The Agenda envisages that the African gross domestic product as a whole must grow by at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms in order to enable the continent to double per capita income by the year 2015. This level of growth will require $30 billion in resources during 1992.\nWe expect that the international community, in cooperation with Africa, will now strive to see that the New Agenda is implemented in accordance with Africa's needs and aspirations. The international community must accept the principle of shared responsibility and full partnership with Africa, and firmly commit itself to giving far more support than it did during the period from 1986 to date. Africa is not, and should not, be made an irrelevant, variable in the world development equation. The United Nations must play a decisive role in Africa's quest and determination to overcome its stalled deve1opment.\nMay I emphasise that Africa's indebtedness is the single major obstacle to development in the continent. The debt problem is a central element of Africa's critical economic situation. Africa's debt is crippling. The realities are as startling as they are depressing. Africa's total debt equals 102.3 per cent of its gross national product and more than 300 per cent of its total exports. On average, 30 per cent of the continent's export earnings is used to service debt. For the least developed countries, the percentage is more than double the average. He cannot continue in this way.\nThere is an urgent need for political dialogue between the creditor nations and the debtor nations on the debt crisis. Let us consider the idea of debt forgiveness for credible and sustained structural adjustment programmes. Let us consider the idea of debt forgiveness for credible environmental protection programmes. Let us consider the idea of debt forgiveness for credible democratisation processes.\nBeyond the issue of debt, what Africa needs is a special financial package, a kind of Marshall Plan, which would demonstrate the sincerity of the developed world for the plight of Africa, right historical wrongs and set the world on the path of a new order that is just and equitable.\nIn recent times, the world has been concerned about such major environmental problems as the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, acid rain and hazardous and toxic waste dumping. Africa's environmental problems of drought, deforestation, desertification and erosion are no less severe than the environmental problems of industrialized countries. We have, within our limited resources, made efforts to contain environmental degradation which, in the developing countries, is closely linked to poverty and underdevelopment. The promotion of economic and social development therefore, constitutes an essential factor in the protection of the environment.\nAs we look forward to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, we urge the international community to commit itself fully to the pursuit of environmentally sound technology, which will available to all countries. In order to fulfil that commitment, the Conference should set up an international mechanism to implement a truly global programme of action. Such a programme should embrace all aspects of the threat to the environment, without prejudice to the development aspirations of Africa and other developing regions.\nThe positive and dramatic changes in the world have facilitated the resolution of some regional conflicts. He are however concerned that a number of other conflicts, the continuation of which threatens international peace and security, remain unresolved. We urge all countries concerned to avail themselves of the present international climate to seek peaceful solutions to their disputes under the aegis of the United Nations and of their regional organizations.\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) continues to seek ways to improve its machinery for resolving African conflicts and for bringing enduring peace to our continent. Currently we are seeking solutions to the conflicts in the Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda. As Chairman of the OAU I am personally engaged in these processes.\nAt the subregional level, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) continues to be actively involved, at great cost to its members, in helping the people of Liberia bring peace to their country. A special ECOWAS committee was established in July to take a fresh look at ways and means of advancing the peace process in Liberia. We are gratified that agreement was reached by all parties to the conflict to encamp and disarm the warring factions and to establish an electoral commission to conduct legislative and presidential elections.\nI want to use the privilege of this occasion once again to appeal to our brothers in Africa to bury the hatchet and seek a peaceful settlement of the problems that have torn them and their countries apart.\nThis Assembly has, for over 30 years, supported the aspirations of the people of southern Africa for the establishment of a non-racial democratic society. In line with that position the Assembly declared apartheid a crime against humanity and proceeded to recommend the imposition of sanctions on the South African regime. These years of international pressure, and the struggle of the people of southern Africa, have had a great impact on the thinking and, consequently, the policies of the Government of South Africa.\nAt the last OAU Summit we took cognisance of the positive changes that had taken place in that country. We welcomed them. The United Nations must take great satisfaction and pride in its own significant contribution to bringing about the changes. Lovers of freedom and all those who suffered, all those who are still suffering, and those who paid the supreme sacrifice must be commended on the progress made towards the dawn of a new order in southern Africa.\nSouth Africa has yet to arrive at the final destination. The international community must, therefore, remain vigilant until the goals of freedom, justice and a non-racial and democratic society are achieved in South Africa.\nWe note the effort to stamp out communal violence resulting in the meeting which took place in Johannesburg on 14 September 1991, during which a national peace accord was signed by the African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party. We commend all those responsible for this agreement.\nWe recognize that cooperation between a new South Africa and other African countries with the requisite potential can act as a catalyst for economic growth and development. Africa is prepared to welcome a new, non-racial and democratic South Africa as a respectable member of the comity of nations and to establish normal and fruitful relations with it. More than at any time in the past the Middle East is now on the threshold of a major peace effort. Recent developments, particularly the agreement to convene a peace conference, have indeed strengthened our conviction that the road to peace in the region is through negotiation and not war. We congratulate all those who are working tirelessly for the convening of the peace conference. It behoves all parties to the conflict to demonstrate their desire for peace. We therefore appeal to them to spare no effort in order to arrive at a just and durable solution that will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the region.\nDuring the Gulf War, the world was gripped with fear over the possible use of chemical weapons. We in Africa have always emphasized that nations should not only forswear the use of these weapons, as stipulated in the 1925 Geneva Protocol, but also support the complete prohibition of their development, production and stockpiling, as well as their elimination from the arsenals of those who possess them. We therefore call for the urgent conclusion of the chemical weapons convention.\nWe note with satisfaction the agreement reached so far between the United States and the Soviet Union in the field of nuclear disarmament. We congratulate President George Bush on the far-reaching initiatives he announced a few days ago and we equally welcome the prompt response by President Mikhail Gorbachev. Those acts of statesmanship represent a significant milestone in efforts to avert a nuclear catastrophe.\nWe in Africa have taken concrete steps in the pursuit of our long-standing Declaration to make our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Africa is equally concerned about the increasing proliferation of conventional weapons. Given their destructive capacity, their threat to international peace and security and the enormous human and financial drain they constitute to all nations, especially the developing countries, the international community should begin in earnest to address the question of the arms race in conventional weapons in a constructive and non-discriminatory manner.\nIn a few years' time, the United Nations will mark its golden jubilee. In the four and a half decades of its existence it has provided the forum for defusing tensions through dialogue, even where it could not resolve the issues. It has been the catalyst for the ending of colonialism and for the realization of the fundamental rights of peoples to self-determination and independence.\nThe United Nations Charter embodies principles that are fundamental to the achievement of peace. It is our duty, therefore, to strengthen the Organization. In doing so we must strive to adapt its major organs to the realities of today and to the demands of tomorrow.\nIt is time to address in a very serious manner the composition of the Security Council. It is one major organ of the United Nations that needs to be democratized. Its membership of 15 has become inadequate in view of the expanded membership of the United Nations since 1965 when the Security Council was last enlarged. The limitation of the permanent membership to the present five has become both anachronistic and unrepresentative.\nThe logic of democracy cannot be confined within the borders of individual States, but must, of necessity, be applicable to the operation of international organizations. It is therefore our considered opinion that there is need to expand the membership of the Security Council and to admit additional permanent members representing all the regions of the world. \nThe deep commitment of African States to the United Nations has been demonstrated over the years. As a further mark of that commitment the Organisation of African Unity has presented a list of distinguished candidates for consideration to serve the Organisation in the capacity of Secretary-General. Africa's case for the office has been misinterpreted to mean special pleading. Our case is based on competence and justice. Africa is set to give the world its best in the pursuit of the lofty goals that informed the establishment of the United Nations. Africa therefore calls upon the rest of the world to apply a proper sense of justice in considering the appointment of a new United Nations Secretary-General. We strongly believe that the next Secretary-General should be an African.\nFor us in Africa, a new world order should give primacy to the United Nations, which should be revitalised to fulfil its mandate under the Charter as the principal Instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. It should be a forum for harmonizing the interests of the strong and the weak. All countries must recognize the universal applicability of international law because the future of humanity ultimately depends on that recognition.\nIn addition, for the new world order to be truly equitable all Members of the United Nations should commit themselves to the principle that prosperity, like security, is indivisible. The persistent neglect of the economic circumstances of most countries in the third world puts at great risk lasting harmony in inter-State relations. The division of the world into a rich minority and a poor majority poses a threat to international peace and security. In the recent past the world has seen the end of certain rigidities in international political relations. This has given us all new hope. Let us also eliminate the rigidities in international economic and financial relations.\nWe urge nine years from the end of a momentous century, one that has witnessed wars, liberation and man's conquest of space. Let us create a new world order that would be beneficial to all. Let all nations resolve to make this last decade of the century a decade of peace, a decade of security and stability, a decade of racial harmony and a decade for development.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure and an honour to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. You and your country, Saudi Arabia, have consistently played a significant and responsible role in the affairs of the Organization, and most dramatically in the last 12 months. I express the greatest confidence in your ability to guide us through these critical times and pledge my country's full cooperation. You will no doubt be inspired and encouraged by the support which the Assembly gave to your predecessor and by the distinguished manner in which he discharged his mandate.\nIt is a special pleasure, too, for me to welcome to membership of this world body the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - a cause which my country espoused in this body as long ago as 1984. The membership of these countries further reinforces the international character of the United Nations and will doubtless contribute to the deepening of a constructive dialogue not only between the Koreas themselves but in other areas of dispute as well. We congratulate them, while expressing full solidarity with their efforts towards unification. We also wish to welcome Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.\nThis first year of the final decade of the twentieth century continues to be dominated by good news. With few exceptions, the revolutionary changes which are transforming the world's economy and the relationships between nations are taking place in a spirit of cooperation, of mutual respect, of hope for a new world order in which the world will see itself as a single, interrelated, interdependent organism in which the responsibility of each nation towards all other nations is given real meaning. Regional integration movements should be perceived as steps towards this objective and should receive the greatest possible support from the international community.\nIt is within this context that we call upon the parties to the conflicts in the Middle East to seize the unique opportunities offered by the current world context to bring lasting and just peace to that troubled region. The time may never again be as propitious. Confrontational attitudes cannot guarantee, ultimately, lasting security and peace. Only mutual respect between neighbours, the just distribution and utilization of resources, and balanced development can do this. The United Nations as an organization and its Member nations must use whatever influence they have to prevail upon the leadership of the nations and factions in that region to move away from their well-known and advertised preconditions and towards greater openness and trust, even a willingness to take risks, without which progress is not possible.\nThe world community, not least the third world, must renounce the use of force as a means of resolving regional disputes. This would reduce significantly expenditure on armaments of all kinds and divert the resources released thereby to development.\nI pause here to applaud the recent initiative of President Bush towards deepening the nuclear disarmament and to welcome the Soviet Union's largely positive response. Dominica would like to see the good will engendered by these actions lead to further and more rapid progress in disarmament talks.\nUntil recently, development has been undertaken without sensitivity to environmental impacts. The resultant pollution and deterioration have impacted not only on those countries which have reaped the benefits of development but on all of us. The resistance of the developing countries to the insistent demands of the Industrialised world that we the poor of the world must now carry the burden of environmental protection is both rational and understandable. The protection of the environment in the interests of the whole world cannot be at the expense of the development prospects of the poor of the underdeveloped regions of the South while the people of the developed North enjoy to the full, and exclusively, the benefits reaped from the almost total depletion of the natural resources of their regions, which took place over the last two centuries but which has had a tremendous, deleterious effect on the entire world. The peoples of the industrialised countries must, in justice, not only work for a halt to environmental deterioration but also assist in very concrete ways in bringing the peoples of the developing world into a fair share of the benefits of development.\nThe matter of third-world development is closely related to the matter of human rights, another legitimate concern of the international community. We are very pleased to see the remarkable growth in respect for human rights and democratic practices that has characterized the past decade both in Eastern Europe and in our own hemisphere of the Americas. We emphasize, however, that this search for democracy cannot be sustained, far less triumph, unless it is accompanied by economic advances and improvements in the social conditions of the peoples of those countries. The agencies of the United Nations and the world community in general need to be more sensitive to the development needs of the developing countries, and more especially to the need for development of human resources through education, training and the transfer of technology. But the urgent and basic human needs of the world's poor demand immediate attention.\nThat brings me to the tragedy of Haiti, a country which, after a proud start as the world's first black republic almost 200 years ago, and after decades of the harshest imaginable repression under the Duvaller dictatorship, was beginning to see the light of a new day of hope. President Aristide had been installed after the first free, fair and open election that country had experienced. The economy remained in a shambles, with no realistic expectation of early prosperity, but at least with a commitment on the part of the President to work assiduously towards taking his country \\\"from misery to poverty\\\" as an immediate goal. The democratically elected Government forswore privilege and prestige and identified with the plight of the people, with the rule of law, and with respect for human rights.\nAll hope was dashed on 30 September 1991 with the news of the bloody military coup and the arrest and exile of President Aristide. We thank God that at least his life was spared, and we pay a tribute to the Ambassador of France in Haiti for his courage, and to the Ambassadors of the United States and Venezuela for their intervention in that respect.\nThe violent and illegal interruption of the democratic process in that sister Caribbean republic cannot be tolerated. At this time when democracy is being expanded and consolidated in the hemisphere, and after we have successfully resisted and prevailed over similar acts in Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada within the Caribbean, such a reversal is wholly unacceptable. The Organization of American States has undertaken very firm action in response to these events, action which has the full backing of Dominica, and I call on the United Nations and its Member States to join with the countries of this hemisphere in isolating the illegal regime in control of Haiti, diplomatically, economically and commercially, and in taking such other action as may be necessary to bring an end to that illegal regime and to reinstate President Aristide to his legitimate authority as the duly and democratically elected head of that Caribbean republic.\nPresident Aristide has called on his people to have confidence in the International community. Let us honour that call and not betray the confidence of the people of Haiti. Let us, with General Colin Powell, Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, let incipient military dictators know that democracy demands that military professionals must \\\"subordinate themselves totally to the will of the people and their elected representatives\\\".\nDevelopments in South Africa give cause for cautious optimism. We shall continue to monitor the situation and to respond to developments as appears to us appropriate. In the meantime, Dominica maintains economic sanctions against the minority regime in that country while applying flexibility in other areas such as cricket, where we have backed the re-entry of South Africa into international competition. We look forward to the day when South Africa, under a democratically elected Government, can take its full and rightful place in the international community.\nWe are thankful that the prevalence of international terrorism which so characterized our world only one year ago has to a great extent retreated. We cannot, however, afford complacency. Terrorism is a scourge on the world community and cannot be justified on any grounds. Until it is eradicated altogether and all the hostages, who are among the greatest victims of terrorism, have been released, the commitment of the international community to fight the scourge must be sustained.\nNo less dangerous, and certainly not in retreat, is the problem of the international traffic in narcotic drugs. This problem continues to plague the world, not least the Caribbean and American regions. The effectiveness of coordination between nations, especially in interdiction and in forfeiture of the proceeds of the trade, must be enhanced if we are to enjoy success in our efforts. The principal attraction of the trade is the incredible profit which it brings to those who participate in it, and we shall not realise real success until we succeed in making the risks inherent in the trade greater than the financial attractions attendant on it.\nAs with most commodities in international trade, it is not the producers of the raw materials who reap the benefits of the trade. Thus, the peasants who grow coca, opium poppies or marijuana receive less than 1 per cent of the street value of the final product. It is not beyond the ability of the international community to so stabilize the price for the narrow band of commodities on which most developing countries depend as to make it more attractive for peasants to grow such traditional export crops as coffee, cocoa, bananas than to grow marijuana, coca or opium poppies.\nWe in the Caribbean are particularly vulnerable and must work ever more closely with our neighbours in this struggle for survival. In this context, our neighbours are, most immediately, the countries of the Caribbean, Latin America and North America, including France with its Caribbean Departments. However, in the broader context of development, Dominica views the entire world as its neighbour and emphasizes the critical importance of interdependence, cooperation and policy coordination in the interests of world peace, stability, security and development. The principal task of the United Nations in the last decade of the twentieth century must be to undertake the coordination of the integral development of all nations, the elimination of the fundamental causes of conflict - primarily exploitation, mistrust and underdevelopment - and the universal adoption of a new concern for international equity, which, as far as Dominica is concerned at this moment, must start with an adequate regime within the European single market to come into effect in 1993 to protect the vital interests of the small banana-producing economies of the Windward Islands, in which endeavour our neighbours in Central and South America must recognise a responsibility.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBy electing Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia to the presidency of its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly paid a tribute to hit eminent professional and personal qualities as well as do honour to his country, whose commitment to international peace and security is well known to all. In extending sincerest congratulations to him we should also like to assure him that we are entirely at his disposal as he carries out his mission.\nTo his predecessor, Ambassador Guido de Marco, we wish to express our feelings of deep gratitude for the competent and committed manner in which he discharged his mandate in the course of a particularly busy year.\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, we renew our deep gratitude for his tireless efforts in the service of the noble ideals of our Organisation.\nIt is fortunate that our Organisation each day becomes more universal. Last year Namibia and Liechtenstein were admitted to the Organisation. This year the Republic of Korea, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been admitted to membership in the great family of the United Nations. We welcome them to our midst with the conviction that they will help to consolidate the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nThis year's session of the General Assembly is taking place in the midst of the upheavals which have been taking place since 1989, as a result of which a new political map of the world is being drawn before our very eyes. These upheavals, which have brought about a radical departure from the antagonisms of the cold-war era, have produced till now positive effects inspiring much hope.\nMany peoples, which yesterday were subject to the oppressive yoke of the systems and structures that ran counter to their aspirations, are today slaking their thirst for freedom and attaining their desire for emancipation. On all the continents a new wind of freedom and democracy is blowing.\nAt the same time, the process of disarmament is being consolidated and the way is now open for the settlement of conflicts which have thus far eluded all attempts at solution.\nIn Angola, the civil war is coming to an end and national reconciliation, which has been so earnestly desired, is now on the agenda.\nIn Liberia, the process of peace initiated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is proceeding apace and we hope that eventually it will make it possible for the Liberian people to achieve national reconciliation through free and democratic elections. Senegal, which has the honour of presiding over ECOWAS, wishes to take this opportunity to appeal for the international community's support for this regional effort to help Liberia out of a crisis which has lasted far too long.\nIn Mozambique, a process of negotiations has begun. However, we regret that this process has stalled, and we should like to encourage the parties to the conflict, and all men of good will who earnestly hope to help this country regain peace in national concord, to pursue efforts with a view to the final settlement of a conflict which has already cost this friendly country so much.\nIn South Africa, encouraging measures have been taken to bring about the eradication of a system that the entire world has condemned. Senegal supports the continuation of efforts that have already been made in that country, convinced as we are that men of the calibre of Nelson Mandela and of Frederick de Klerk will successfully conclude their just struggle for democracy and national reconciliation.\nIn Cambodia, significant progress has been made in the process of implementation of the settlement plan aimed at bringing about an overall solution in harmony and pence.\nThe new climate in international relations has made it possible for us to overcome a crisis which, by its very nature and because of its consequences, was a major challenge to the credibility of our Organisation.\nEver since the beginning of the conflict in the Gulf, my country has upheld the side of law in condemning the inadmissible aggression to which Kuwait had fallen victim, and once again commends the determination with which the international community was able to ensure respect for right and legality.\nThe unity and steadfastness of purpose with which the United Nations restored the inalienable rights of Kuwait are cause for much hope - hope that henceforth it will be possible for our Organization to achieve its primary purpose, which is:\n\\\"To be a centre for harmonising the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.\\\"\nThis is related to the noble task which the international community has the overriding duty to carry out today: and that is to make sure, unequivocally, that these hopes are not dashed.\nIt does not detract from the positive aspects of the changes which are under way to emphasise that we still have a long way to go before achieving a world of peace, justice and progress. Along with the prospects for security, freedom and progress, chronic ills, such as underdevelopment and poverty, persist, and at the same time new challenges are emerging which take the form of ethnic or nationality conflicts, the risk of civil war and waves of xenophobia, as a result of emigration which is today the topic of discussion in many wealthy countries and a matter of daily concern in developing countries.\nThat is to say that we find ourselves at a crossroads, at a crucial time, when we must build a new order on the ruins of the old which is crumbling before our very eyes. Thus, we are faced with all the problems of building something new on what is old. This is a challenge that all nations mist meet together. If, heretofore, the stand-off between the military blocs and the power rivalries between them have ensured peace in one part of the world and have even shifted conflicts to other geographical areas, it is now no longer possible to make this confrontation an excuse for perpetuating intolerable situations.\nAs a free and democratic country, as a country that is devoted to peace through law, fully committed to the strengthening of peace and security and to the enhancement of international solidarity and cooperation, Senegal wishes to make its contribution to this consideration of this new international order which the whole world so ardently desires.\nThe first consideration must be to ensure respect for law in international relations. In our view, that is an indispensable condition for a new order with which all countries, all peoples and all nations of the world will identify because the new order will express their legitimate aspirations for freedom, peace and social progress. My country has always insisted that there can be no lasting peace, no security and no justice unless all nations comply with the rules of law which it is the responsibility of the United Nations to lay down.\nAnd here we see the full meaning of the hopes that have been placed in the resolution of the crisis in the Gulf to which I have just referred. The unprecedented mobilization of efforts in support of international law during this crisis should inspire future efforts in every situation where law is in jeopardy. If justice is to prevail the law must be the same for everyone.\nIt is not one of the fundamental purposes of this Organization to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples?\nIn saying that, I cannot but think of the tragedy of the Palestinian people, who are still waiting for the International community to restore their inalienable rights to their homeland and to a land where they can establish the political and social system of their choice.\nToday, as laudable efforts are being made to organize a peace conference on the Middle East, we cherish the hope that this conference will be able to provide a framework for negotiations which, on the basis of the relevant decisions of the United Nations, may finally initiate a process leading towards peace, security and good neighbourliness with respect for the fundamental rights of the peoples and States of the entire region.\nBut in our opinion, the establishment of an order of peace and security requires more than the implementation of real preventive diplomacy to manage situations where there is a threat to peace.\nThe Security Council, which is entrusted with the task of maintaining international peace and security, would appear to be the ideal body for carrying out this mission. The new atmosphere which has prevailed in the Security Council should now enable it fully to discharge the authority which has been vested in it by the Charter of the United Nations. Would it not then be desirable to go a step farther and anticipate and prevent these conflicts?\nIf the Council were to hold periodic meetings at which it would review the international situation it might be able to identify potential areas of conflict, and then seek to contain the crises before they explode. In this connection, thought should be given to strengthening the role of the Secretary-General and his authority to send observer missions or missions of inquiry to inform the Council about the situation.\nThe United Nations has already scored striking success in its peace-keeping operations and deserves our congratulations. We reaffirm our willingness to continue to support those operations, which play such a useful part in maintaining international peace. Me believe that high priority should be given to strengthening and expanding such endeavours wherever there may be a risk of conflict.\nEstablishing and consolidating peace and security throughout the world also means encouraging the emergence of regimes of freedom and democracy. Freedom is a powerful influence for peace. Is it not significant, as we look at the history of International relations of our day, we see that out of the approximately 150 conflicts which have caused bloodshed throughout the world since the Second World War, none has pitted countries with a democratic system against each other?\nIs it not significant that freedom has been the true catalyst in the present relaxation of the tension between the two blocs which were antagonists before? As the Constitution of UNESCO proclaims: \\\"Wars begin in the minds of men and it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.\\\"\nConstructing these defences of peace implies enhancing the values of freedom, tolerance and respect for human rights. And it is because, today, there is a consensus concerning respect for these values that we are experiencing a new era in international relations. These dynamic forces working for freedom must be encouraged for, as the South Commission so rightly points out:\n\\\"In the final analysis, the South's plea for justice, equity, and democracy in the global society cannot be dissociated from its pursuit of these goals within its own societies ... all these cannot but ... increase the South's chances of securing a new world order\\\" (The Challenge to the South; The Report of the South Commission, p. 287). Senegal and all 16 members of the Economic Community of West Africa understood this. At their last meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, on 6 July 1991, they adopted a \\\"Declaration of Political Principles\\\", which was aimed precisely at giving them a firm foundation along democratic lines.\nIn that Declaration, the member countries committed themselves to: \\\"... promote and encourage the full enjoyment by all our peoples of their fundamental human rights, especially their political, economic, social, cultural, and other rights inherent in the dignity of the human person and essential to his free and progressing development\\\".\nBy expressing in this way their profound attachment to the freedom of the individual and the inalienable right of the individual to participate in the building of the society in which they live, the countries of the Community have committed themselves to making a positive contribution to a more just and peaceful new world.\nThe primacy of international law, the prevention of conflicts and the promotion of freedom are the elements which will enable us to build a new international order capable of meeting continuing challenges.\nTo build a future that is different from the past means also and especially that we have to meet the chronic challenge of underdevelopment. It has been stated that development is another name for peace. Eleven years ago\nthe North-South Commission on the problems of international development, presided over by the former German Chancellor Hilly Brandt, strongly stressed in its report entitled North-South - a Programme for Survivals \\\"Where hunger reigns peace cannot prevail. If we want to banish war we must also banish poverty.\\\" Yet today, despite this warning, poverty persists and is spreading. Constantly worsened by the continuous decrease of raw materials prices, foreign debt and the demands of structural adjustment programmes, this state of affairs shows that international cooperation for development is still not part of the renewal characterising recant international relations. It is an overwhelming fact: crushed under the weight of indebtedness and the worsening of the terms of trade, the countries of the South work and produce more in return for lass in order to pay interest that is itself subject to foreign currency fluctuations. The South continues thus to finance the North at the rate of tens of billions of dollars yearly. Hence, the gap between the rich and the poor is growing.\nAdmittedly, there is an increasing awareness of this unbearable state of affairs and of the interdependence of the economies of the North and the South. It is now recognised that without solving the problems of development, no solution will be found to global environment problems or to those of immigration and drug trafficking, to name but a few.\nIndeed, constructive initiatives have been taken to help redress the endemic imbalance between the North and the South. I am thinking, in particular, of the Paris Conference of September 1990 devoted to the problems of the least developed countries, during which a Programme of Action for those countries was adopted. I am also thinking of numerous individual initiatives taken by some countries of the North to ease the burden of some countries of the South. Bight here in New York, the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly in April 199C identified the recovery of growth in the developing countries as the most serious challenge of the 1990s, while endeavouring to raise international cooperation to the level of that challenge.\nHowever, we must, of course, go further. In the General Assembly last year President Francois Mitterrand Introduced the idea of an international plan of assistance to the developing world, financed by new resources, a plan designed to bring together for a substantive debate the actors in the \\\"tragedy of modern times\\\", that of underdevelopment. These resources could be made available, because with the coming cessation of the arms race, considerable means will be released as part of what is called 'the peace dividend\\\". The long-expressed call for disarmament in favour of development thus becomes even more urgent today. In this regard, it should be noted that the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, held in New York in September 1987, recognized the moral and political link between disarmament and development and the fact that that link should be given practical effect through specific measures taken regionally and internationally.\nTherefore, we believe that the time has come to resume consideration of this question and to ensure that at least part of the huge resources heretofore devoted to the arms race is transferred to development tasks. However, the idea of an international plan of assistance to the developing world calls for establishing a North-South dialogue, which is indispensable for the renewing of international economic relations. Deeply aware of this need, Senegal, together with India, Venezuela and Egypt, took the initiative on the occasion of the bicentennial of the French Revolution in Paris in July 1989 of launching informal discussions on this topic with some countries of the North. This effort is continuing, and we hope that in the end the resumption of this dialogue will be fruitful.\nThis dialogue in favour of cooperation is more desirable than ever to establish mechanisms of cooperation for solidarity and peace between the two poles of the world. Just as indispensable as North-South dialogue is the promotion of 8outh-8outh cooperation, which is an important element of international economic relations. My country, which has made South-South cooperation an essential element of its foreign policy, has also been one of the initiators of the summit group on South-South consultation and exoneration, the Group of 15, which held its first summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur in June 1990. This would be the kind of forum that would give specific content and political drive to South-South cooperation.\nIt is in the same spirit that Senegal has worked, with faith and determination, to promote African economic integration, which has currently entered a new stage with the adoption, during the last summit meeting of the Organisation of African Unity, of a Treaty establishing the African Economic Community. The future community will develop on the basis of regional groups, such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), within whose framework the 16 States of West Africa will endeavour to organise genuine integration in the economic, social and cultural and even political fields.\nWe intend to continue these efforts and to intensify them, because we are aware, as President Abdou Diouf has stated, that\n\\\"the solution to our problems will be found first of all in the organisation of the economic solidarity of our States through the establishment of a truly integrated community\\\".\nThis statement of the Head of State of Senegal, the President of ECOWAS, reflects as eloquently as can be our resolute commitment to achieve African integration, which we consider to be a major step in our permanent quest for increased well-being and progress.\nThis leads me to speak of the specific case of Africa, which the General Assembly considered once again a few days ago during a review meeting of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. May I remind members that President Abdou Diouf, the then President of OAU, was one of those responsible for the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa in May 1966, which led to the drafting of this Programme of Action.\nIt is well known today that Africa has met the commitments it undertook within the framework of this Programme, by implementing the desired reforms in conjunction with international agencies. We must stress that the other partners have not done so. Thus, five years after the adoption of the Programme, it is evident that there has been a net deterioration in economic and social conditions in Africa, which was clearly noted by the Secretary-General in his report to the review meeting a few days ago.\nBut, despite the laudable efforts of the African Group, to our great regret that meeting was unable to achieve consensus enabling it to adopt the draft of the new programme for the development of Africa in the 1990a that had been submitted to it. Hence we take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to take at our present session, which will once more take up this draft programme, the courageous measures needed owing to the unprecedented crisis buffeting our continent.\nFor our part, we shall spare no effort to bring this about.\nFor a country of the Sahel, like Senegal, which for years has been confronted with problems of drought and desertification, environment problems take on a special importance.\nAware of the fact that the struggle to halt the degradation of the environment must first be waged at the national level, in its development policy my country has given priority to the campaign against drought and desertification and for the preservation of natural resources.\nThe importance and scope of the problems linked to the preservation of the environment are such that it is possible to solve them only on a global, planetary scale. International solidarity in this area is thus particularly significant - all the more so given that interests here are so clearly interdependent.\nIndeed, the ecological health of our planet is today seriously affected. The causes are well known: on the one hand, the enormous waste of resources in the consumer societies of the North and, on the other, the desperate struggle for survival in the poor countries of the South. Hence the problem can be solved only through an approach that takes into account the close relationship between environment and development.\nFortunately, the international community has swiftly realized the scope of the problem and its inherent dangerous on world-wide consequences.\nThe entry into force in 1989 of the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone, the adoption in Basle, also in 1989, the Convention on Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes, the London Conference on Climate, held last year, the United Nations study on the rhythm, nature and impact of climatic changes - soon to be published - all constitute positive initiatives following upon this awareness.\nBut these initiatives will have to be strengthened and broadened. That is why we place great hope on the Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in 1992 in Brazil. It should give us an opportunity to study in depth problems linked to climatic changes, to establish principles that should guide our collective attitude towards environment and development problems and, above all, to work out a strategy for action likely not only to halt the degradation of the environment but especially to reverse it.\nThe economic crisis in our countries has led to social distortions affecting in particular the weakest or poorest segments of our populations: women, children and legions of jobless who are deprived of everything, even of a future. Problems such as the advancement of women, the survival and protection of children and illicit drug trafficking should receive our full attention.\nIn this connection, my country reaffirms its unshakable determination to continue supporting the implementation of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and the World Plan of Action, adopted here in September last year by Heads of State or Government, on the occasion of the first World Summit for Children.\nIt is also an opportunity for us to appeal to the international community, within the framework of the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse (1991-2000), to strive to implement measures advocated by the Global Programme of Action adopted at the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to Drugs.\nI should like once store to insist on the fact that juvenile delinquency, illicit drug trafficking, illegal immigration and so many other negative social phenomena remain linked to the state of underdevelopment endemic to the poor countries of the South.\nThe true solution must thus be found in the concerted implementation of balanced development strategies that take due account of the social dimension of economic progress.\nForty-six years ago, as the world emerged from the nightmare of the Second World Mar, a hope was born and a conviction took concrete form - the hope that men everywhere would henceforth know how to prevent the unleashing of new wars by working together to ensure respect for the right of each individual to freedom, dignity and justice, as well as the right of each nation to independence and sovereignty; the conviction that the intellectual and material resources available to mankind could now be devoted exclusively to the peaceful building of the future, and that they could serve to overcome, everywhere, the scourges of poverty, ignorance, epidemics and natural catastrophes.\nFor many nations in the world the evolution of the international situation did not bring about the fulfilment of aspirations to justice and peace. The seemingly irreducible antagonism of two super-Powers, each capable of destroying the planet many times over, ended up by making of international relations a question of simple arithmetic: the weakest peoples became mere pawns and each gain for one camp was a loss for the other.\nToday, as this bipolar order is collapsing, we have an historic opportunity to build a new world based on peace, justice and progress. He can achieve it if we strive sufficiently, for we have the resources and the ability. Mankind has already overcome too many challenges in the course of its turbulent history for there to be any doubt that it can meet this challenge of the third millennium. That is our fondest hope, and it is in our common interest.\nIn welcoming this era of hope and freedom, my country fervently wishes that the emerging new world order will be the collective work of all nations of the world so that never again will any country, any nation, forget that the rule of law is a necessity for all States of the international community and that this rule applies equally to all.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to extend to Ambassador Shihabi my congratulations on his election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His election is a tribute not only to him personally for his long-standing and dedicated contribution to this Organisation, but also to the country he represents, Saudi Arabia, with which Malta has had long ties of friendship and diplomatic relations. I wish him all success in his task and assure him of the support of the delegation of Malta for his endeavours to bring the work of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. During the past 12 months I have come to know him personally. His friendship and advice were an asset to me in my work as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session.\nI also wish to congratulate the new Member States that have joined the community of nations. Malta welcomes the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to membership of the United Nations. Their joining the Organisation as sovereign, independent countries is the vindication of the judgment of history on an aggression pact aimed at the annihilation of three independent Republics, members of the League of Nations. Their presence here is a lesson that the United Nations can never countenance a situation where aggression prevails, and where peoples and nations are bartered by those who have the brazen power to do so.\nThe fact that, having this time last year heard in this Assembly the dignified appeal of His Highness the Emir of Kuwait for the liberation of his country, we have heard him this morning as head of a liberated sovereign State Member of the United Nations is evidence of this resolve.\nWe welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank the respective Governments\nof these two new Members for receiving me in their capitals as President of the General Assembly prior to the filing of their applications to join the Organisation. I am confident that the presence of their two delegations in the United Nations will help to foster dialogue and understanding that will, in the maturity of time, lead to the unification of Korea.\nMy country welcomes the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which, through the Trusteeship Council, have reached sovereignty and independence. Their presence here will certainly contribute to the Pacific dimension of our Organisation.\nIn sponsoring the applications of all seven countries, Malta wanted to register its support for the universality of the United Nations.\nMalta's foreign policy is to project to other nations its true identity by strengthening confidence in and respect for the political norms of a pluralistic society and of a democratic environment where mutual respect and equal rights for all are encouraged and upheld. My country believes that in the further consolidation of these democratic values nations will identify themselves with freedom and social justice.\nWe believe that the human dimension, involving as it does the observance of human rights, the recognition of pluralism, and the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedoms, is basic for an interdependent world where peace is indivisible.\nDuring the past 20 months we have contributed to the termination of a bipolar world. We at the United Nations have lived this bipolarism and were almost marginalized as a result. To those who think that a unipolar world is the outcome of the end of bipolarism, may I suggest that there is no indication that this state of affairs is emerging. The statement made to this \nAssembly by President Bush, assuring the world that the United States has no Intention of striving for a pax Americana but is seeking a pax universalis building on shared responsibility and aspirations, reflects the reality of a situation that depends on us all in its observance. A multipolar approach is evolving in an international scenario where certain countries, or groups of countries, continue affirming themselves. The United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the European Community, the People's Republic of China and Japan are assuming new political and economic responsibilities. However, we reiterate that a multipolar approach in the new international world order cannot be based on this global pentagonal hut must involve the small and medium-sized countries, which can contribute towards the maintenance of peace and security. For the small and medium-sized countries are the majority of States in the United Nations, and they are not a silent majority. They are indeed the countries where many of the world's problems, both political and economic, exist.\nIn this new multipolar international world order that is evolving, the concept of the human dimension must be the golden thread that links it up.\nThe human-dimension concept involves aspects that are intrinsically correlated. The first covers the fundamental human rights and freedoms, which have been defined in international conventions. We believe in these human rights, not in the abstract but in their concrete reality, involving, as they should, not only rights of a juridical nature - important and invaluable in themselves - but also social rights: the right to live, the right to shelter, the right to work. The juridical and the social rights are interdependent.\n\nThe second aspect covers the principle of the rule of law, the principle that protects the individual from the arbitrary exercise of power and from discrimination.\nThe third covers the basic concept of pluralistic democracy, where freedom of assembly and freedom of association can manifest themselves in free and regular elections. Unfortunately, in some countries the principle of \\\"on\u00ae man, one vote\\\" has been amended to \\\"one man, one vote, once\\\".\nThe demise of an ideology based on the dictatorship of any particular sector of society has shown that in the new international world order which is evolving the concept of the human dimension has no frontier. It is now important for the United Nations to create the necessary machinery to ensure that this concept receives mandatory enforcement. May I refer in this context to the statement made by the Foreign Minister of the USSR, Boris Pankin, that \\\"specific human rights issues and matters of compliance with international commitments in this area cannot any longer be dismissed under the artificial pretext of interference in internal affairs\\\".\nThe new international world order is increasing the need for regional arrangements in the maintenance of peace and security. In my Government's view. Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, dealing with regional arrangements, should be examined with a view to encouraging through such regional arrangements the development of the pacific settlement of disputes on the initiative of States themselves or by reference from the Security Council.\nWithin this concept of regional arrangements, Malta forms part of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Ever since the enactment of the Helsinki Final Act, and also as a result of Malta's\ninsistence at the Helsinki Conference, the linkage between security in Europe and security in the Mediterranean has been recognised. The Mediterranean, however, is far from being a lake of peace. The economic and social challenges facing North African countries, the situation In the Middle East and the Cyprus question are prejudicing the prospects for peace and security in the region. He believe and maintain that the international conference on peace in the Middle East, with the Involvement of the United Nations, is still the best formula to approach the problem comprehensively. However, we consider conferences, all conferences, not to be an end in themselves but a means to an end. The end in this case is the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Within those parameters we encourage all initiatives intended to bring together the parties involved. We therefore favour and encourage the initiative which United States Secretary of State Baker is undertaking, an initiative to which the Foreign Minister of the USSR, Boris Pankin, is also contributing. In our view, however, the prospects for peace in the region can start only with the cessation by Israel of its settlements in the occupied territories. These settlements are, and will be, creating further difficulties and indeed great human problems which could prejudice the prospects for a lasting and just solution.\nThe situation in Yugoslavia, a country which faces the Adriatic Sea, is itself a matter of grave concern for all, not only for us in the Mediterranean; the situation in that country is creating issues and problems which the Organization may eventually have to face. On the one hand there is the concept of the sovereignty of a State vis-\u00e0-vis the United Nations, on the other the human dimension involved as a result of the war activities taking \n\nplace. There is a distinction between national minorities and national entities. On the Issue of national minorities, many are the international bodies which have set out the parameters of protection within the State to which these belong. But national entities - peoples which have their own national identity and group themselves, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes as a result of historical circumstances, and who react to situations preferring to disengage themselves from larger entities - require a different approach.\nWe are looking at this subject in full awareness of the complexities resulting there from, but also with the realism that the situation deserves. The situation in Yugoslavia may herald similar situations in other countries In Europe and in Africa, where, through the course of wars, conquests and colonialism, peoples have been moved, bartered and battered. Great sensitivity to the past and realism today are fundamental in reaching solutions which are to be based on the unacceptability of the use of force and the need to take account of all legitimate concerns and aspirations.\nThe position of my Government on the situation in Yugoslavia is that we are participating fully in the efforts of the CSCE to restore order and stability in the country for the benefit of the people and to defuse a situation which could become a threat to security and stability in the region. Any attempt in such circumstances to impose solutions through the use of armed force may carry serious consequences for the future.\nWe hope that all political and military leaders in Yugoslavia and in its constituent republics will reassert the CSCE principles as a means to achieve a negotiated peace worthy of a new Europe and the new international order we are seeking to create. We believe that the European Community is making a\npositive contribution and, through the services of Lord Carrington, us trying to bring the parties to a peaceful settlement. The United Nations may be called upon to shoulder responsibilities envisaged in the Charter, with particular reference to Chapter VIII, dealing with regional arrangements.\nDisarmament continues to be a priority objective for the international community. Despite the end of the cold war, annual military expenditure world-wide exceeds $900 billion. To add to the tragedy of the third world, developing countries, to procure foreign weapons, spend as a whole an equivalent of 23 per cent over and above the amount they receive In economic development aid.\nMalta is in favour of the reduction of nuclear weapons with a view to their ultimate elimination, in favour of a balanced reduction of conventional weapons, and in favour of the complete prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons. My Government is in favour of urgent action being taken to apply confidence- and security-building measures on the high seas. \n\nAs an island and Mediterranean State, Malta advocates that naval disarmament should feature prominently in international negotiations. The process which is unfolding in Europe in nuclear disarmament must be extended to cover sea-based as well as airborne sites. As much as we need open skies we need open seas.\nThe CSCE process has entered a new and important phase. A concept of security and cooperation is emerging from Vancouver to Vladivostok. A common vocabulary is being used. The Charter of Paris is a milestone in both the political and the social fields.\nMalta's role in the new Europe has been appropriately addressed by its application to join the\nEuropean Community. We believe that the European Community, to live up to its responsibility as the motor force leading to European unity, has to be outward looking and ready for enlargement. He are amongst those who believe that a process of in-depth structuring does not hinder its enlargement.\nThe intergovernmental conferences leading to monetary union and political cooperation, coupled with the acquis communitaire process, should not constitute a barrier between the Twelve and the rest in Europe that have the qualifications and the political will to join.\nIt is, in our view, relevant to give due weight to the market aspect of the Community, but may we suggest that Ballstein's concept of the European Community - not being \\\"in business, we are in politics\\\" - should take precedence in the proper evaluation of the Community's role in Europe and the world.\nMalta's role in Europe is linked to its role in the Mediterranean. Indeed, we believe that Malta's participation in the Community will further Strengthen the cooperation between the Community and the southern countries of \n\nthe Mediterranean. Within this concept also we advocate a conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, and continue to give our support to the Western Mediterranean Forum.\nIn this general debate speakers have touched on problems of the developing world. The United Nations has to be the conscience of the world in realising that there exists a poverty curtain where billions of men and women are condemned at birth to lead a life of misery and hunger. It is the responsibility of our Organisation to create the necessary structures to ensure that this indictment against today's society, harbouring mountains of butter in one part while part of humanity is dying from hunger and want in other areas of the world, be removed.\nWe are witnessing 15 million refugees and more, victims of strife and drought. We have hunger-refugees for whom our conventions do not apply.\nAs President of the General Assembly I wrote to this effect to the Secretary-General, not only referring to the presence of the Albanian boat people, but also suggesting that initiatives be taken in the United Nations so that the concept of \\\"refugees\\\" be extended to cover \\\"hunger-refugees\\\", and that measures be considered to encourage further economic assistance, through both bilateral and multilateral sources in these unfortunate circumstances. On this matter I have received positive indications from both the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Refugees.\nWe believe that this Organization cannot relegate its role to that of a mere spectator in the field of economic development. Far from relegating itself, it has to make economic development the spearhead of its activities for a more just, secure and equitable global society.\nThe issue of the environment is of particular interest to my Government, which has already taken an initiative on the adverse consequences of climate \nchange. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in June 1992, will consider the adoption of a framework convention on climate change, a fitting conclusion to three years of intensive negotiations on an initiative taken by the Government of Malta at the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\nIssues affecting the common heritage of mankind, in particular the seabed, issues affecting the common concern of mankind, in particular global warming and sea-level rise, problems affecting the rights of future generations - all are subjects which require our constant attention. For they concern matters that are kept by us in trust for future generations.\nWithin this context we have already proposed to the Assembly that the Trusteeship Council, in addition to its functions under the Charter, should not only be entrusted with Territories and men but should also be the Trusteeship Council of the world in matters affecting the common heritage and common concerns of an everlasting humanity.\nFor this Organization to be able to play its role to defend the peace, to live the freedoms and to promote social progress and better standards of life, it has to evolve into a second-generation United Nations. For this purpose there has to be a constitutional linkage between its principal organs - the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Secretariat. As the Secretary-General pointed out in his report,\n\\\"This ... is not merely an issue of the internal working of the Organization; it bears on the guardianship of peace exercised by the United Nations.\\\" (A/46/1, p. 20)\nWe think that the principle of frugality must be at the basis of our Organization. To meet the new challenges which the international situation \n\nhas opened up for the United Nations we need more resources and a stronger financial commitment. He have expressed the importance of the principle of frugality, not because less will be spent, but in order to ensure that the greater financial involvement will give optimal results.\nFor this second-generation United Nations to have the moral strength and to be at the service of the peoples of the world we think that the following considerations are important\u00bb\none, a revitalisation of the United Nations principal organs, with particular reference to the General Assembly and its links with the Security Council and the Secretariat;\ntwo, the creation of conflict-warning systems;\nthree, enhancing the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations in order to reinforce peace where such a presence is useful and required;\nfour, a strong lead by the United Nations in the disarmament process, particularly in regulating the transfer and sale of arms;\nfive, the mobilization of all human resources to fight against poverty in the world as well as to provide solutions for the refugee tragedy;\nsix, a modern and adequate approach to the problems afflicting contemporary societies, in particular the fight against drugs, AIDS and terrorism;\nseven, the creation of an emergency centre against natural and man-made disasters; \neight, the additional role of the Trusteeship Council as a body designed to safeguard the environment, the common heritage of mankind and common concerns for future generations;\nnine, the setting up of an efficient system of international security giving Articles 43 and 45 of the Charter the relevance conceived by the founders of the United Nations;\nten, re-evaluating and re-assessing the purposes and aims of regional arrangements considered under Chapter VIII of the Charter;\neleven, the development of and respect for international law, not only in its classic spheres but also in economic and environmental development;\ntwelve, the accentuation of the role of the individual in the United Nations, giving the human dimension its rightful prominence in promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedoms.\nHe have tried in this statement to give the views and reactions of a country with limited dimensions, but with geostrategic relevance in the Mediterranean, to the problems of today and to the concept of the United Nations. Malta has tried to give its contribution with other nations towards the principles of the Charter within a context of the new international situation.\nFor it is to the United Nations that peoples throughout the world are entrusting their future. The United Nations has generated a sense of service and dedication to the cause of man living the concept of peace in freedom.\nMay I in this context express to the Secretary-General the sincere thanks of my country for his dedication to the cause of peace. Mr. Peres de Cuellar has given a decade of his life to this Organisation as Secretary-General. May I suggest that for the Secretary-General these past 12 months have perhaps \n(Mr. de Marco. Malta)\nBeen the most difficult in that the occupation of Kuwait created in him a conflict natural in a man of peace gifted with great sensitivity for mankind. Having been close to the Secretary-General during these past 12 months, I want to express my deep admiration for his services in the cause of peace.\nWe are all facing the unknown, but it is an unknown for which we possess a compass. Although the present and latent difficulties and problems are many, this forty-sixth year of the United Nations can herald a greater commitment to the cause of peace and justice.\nWe have a unique opportunity in the present international situation to create a new international order. We cannot miss this opportunity. In the words of Henri Bergson, \\\"Time is a path you do not pass over twice.\\\" That is today's challenge for building tomorrow's future.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI present to Mr. Shihabi my most sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I am certain that his experience and ability will guide us to fruitful results.\nI also take this opportunity to extend my felicitations to the new States Members of the United Nations, wishing them progress and success in the service of the United Nations Charter and its objectives. In the meantime, I look forward to the day on which the State of Palestine will become a full-fledged Member of the United Nations.\nWhile stressing the importance of compliance with the principles of the Charter, Iraq reiterates the necessity of implementing its provisions equitably, without discrimination, and in a manner that would not allow one single State or small group of States to control the destiny of any other State on the premise that might is right and by exerting all sorts of pressure to influence the decisions of this Organization. Unless the provisions of the Charter and international law itself are implemented in a just manner on the basis of equity, they will become instruments of suppression and divisiveness.\nWe believe, therefore, that we are called upon today more than ever before to strengthen the role of the General Assembly at a time when the world is witnessing rapid developments that have marginalized the role of the United Nations in the search for solutions to the Issues emanating from those developments. This holds true, of course, only in so far as the big five permanent, members of the Security Council do not see it in their interests to give the United Nations a role or to use it as a cover for some act of so-called international legitimacy. In that regard, we point to the decision adopted by the tenth meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was held in Accra, the capital of Ghana during the first week of this month. That decision states that:\n\\\"Additionally, the emerging tendencies towards a unipolar world characterized by new elements in the increasingly complex international political landscape could limit the prospects of resolving the global problems of today, as the interests and needs of the non-aligned and other developing countries are not taken into due account.\\\" On 23 September, we listened to the address delivered by United States President Bush to the General Assembly. We cannot but express our regret that a President of a State - indeed, the biggest Power - would resort to unseemly attacks on the President of my country in a manner incompatible with diplomatic practice.\nIn that context, if we were to call the United States President names as he allowed himself to do to my President, we would wonder what to call one who killed women, children and the elderly with his planes and missiles, and who bombarded the Amiria shelter, killing even more women and children. What could we call one who gave the orders to bury Iraqi soldiers alive, whose forces targeted baby food factories, or who insists on depriving a population of IB million of food, medicine, and all other means of livelihood? We leave the answer to the international community and the United Nations.\nNotwithstanding the United States President's repeated assertions that he does not want the Iraqi people to suffer from famine, food shortages or a lack of the basic requirements of civilian life, the fact remains that the United States Administration is responsible above all others for the suffering of the Iraqi people. The United States President went beyond the provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions in seeking to dictate to the Council that the sanctions against Iraq should not be lifted until the political system of Iraq is changed. Thus he ignores the provisions of Security Council resolutions and flouts the provisions of the United Nations Charter to which he has claimed to be committed and determined to implement in this new era in international relations.\nThe continuation of the inhuman embargo against Iraq and its people in spite of the Iraqi acceptance of all Security Council resolutions is a flagrant exploitation of the suffering of the Iraqi people for purely political alms. While we draw attention to the clear double standards employed by the United States in its policy towards Iraq, we must underline these double standards as reflected in the speech of the United States President. While he completely ignored the question of Palestine, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories and the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their human and national rights and the right of self-determination, the United States President chose to propagate the false claim that Zionism is not a political movement. This statement shows either that the President of the United States does not comprehend the nature of the Zionist movement or that he is deliberately altering the facts and rewriting history in order to satisfy Israel and the Zionist lobby.\n\nIraq has been subjected, in the name of international legitimacy and under the pretext of upholding it, to a deliberate full-scale destruction of all aspects of life. The facts about the events preceding the attack on Iraq have confirmed the premeditated intentions of the Powers which perpetrated this destruction to weaken Iraq, undermine its sovereignty and humiliate its people, especially after Iraq had come out of an eight-year war stronger and with greater regional and international weight than ever before. The rulers of Kuwait were chosen to conspire with the West, and with the United States in particular, to destroy the Iraqi economy as the first phase of a design for the total destruction of Iraq. All efforts exerted by Iraq and the Arab States and all the warnings candidly voiced by Iraq to them, with a view to persuade them to desist from the great harm they were inflicting upon the\nIraqi people, went unheeded. In fact, they delved more deeply into their arrogant hostility and further increased their collusion through the suspect oil policy they pursued. Their aim was to bring Iraq to its knees, break the will of its people, and starve its children, women and elderly. The declared objective of the United States and its allies, which meant to prepare for and justify their aggression against Iraq, was initially the so-called defence of Saudi Arabia. Then the objective became the ejection of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Yet the military operations planned and carried out for the supposed liberation of Kuwait did not begin in Kuwait. The aggression was initiated on 17 January 1991, with a full-scale campaign of air bombardment whose targets were the economic infrastructure and civilian residential centres everywhere in Iraq. This resulted in the destruction of power plants, power transmission systems, oil refineries, bridges, irrigation regulators, water purification centres, factories, hospitals, schools, places of worship, infant-milk factories, grain silos and civilian shelters.\nThe destruction of the Amiriya civilian shelter targeted by the criminal allied war planes, in which 319 civilians, mainly children, women and elderly people, lost their lives in the fire or through suffocation, stands out as an example of the barbarity perpetrated against Iraq. Here these targets on the Kuwait front? Did the Security Council adopt resolution 678 (1990) to achieve these objectives and to put Iraq on the brink of a comprehensive calamity, the victim of which is the civilian population, especially children, women and the elderly? The allied air raids, led by the United States, dropped in an uninterrupted manner over a period of 43 days, about 100,000 tons of explosives on cities and villages everywhere in Iraq, from north to south and from east to west. Here all these cities and villages front-line military\ntargets on the Kuwaiti front7 Did the liberation of Kuwait require the destruction of Iraq?\nNeither Security Council resolution 687 (1990) nor any of the resolutions adopted prior to it authorises the United States of America and its allies to destroy Iraq. No one in his right mind could accept that destruction of all Iraqi civilian installations was the only way to force the Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. The battle-front itself witnessed the worst of United States ignominy and cowardice when the Americans chose to use tank ploughs to bury thousands of Iraqi soldiers alive in their trenches instead of having to fight them on the battlefield. Pentagon sources have admitted the actual perpetration of this abject operation when the story was published in the United States press on 12 September instant.\nWe call upon the international community through this forum and through the other regional and international organizations to condemn that criminal act, investigate it and hold its perpetrators fully responsible. We also call upon the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct an investigation of the matter and take the measures necessary for the bodies of our martyrs to be brought home.\nThat is one example of the practices employed by the United States, in violation of all known military principles, to achieve their so-called victory over the valiant soldiers of Iraq.\nIt is worth stating that Mr. Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, pointed out in his annual report this year, dated 6 September 1991, that the measures taken to use force were not carried out exactly in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, for the Security Council \n\\\"authorized the use of force on a national and coalition basis\\\" (A/46/1, P- 5)\nrather than by the United Nations itself. The Secretary-General stressed the necessity \\\"that the rule of proportionality in the employment of armed force is observed and the rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts are complied with\\\" (ibid.). The Secretary-General also pointed out in his report the importance that the human effect of sanctions on the population of the State subject to such sanctions need to be carefully borne in mind.\nHaving completed the withdrawal of its forces from Kuwait, Iraq declared both its acceptance of the resolutions issued by the Security Council and its commitment to their implementation.\nWith regard to resolution 687 (1991), which effected the cease-fire, and further to the withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory, all Kuwaiti prisoners of war and detainees have been released and repatriated along with all third-country nationals, while the operation to return Kuwaiti properties is being continued. As regards the other paragraphs, the resolution entrusts the United Nations with the task of pursuing their implementation, and the United Rations is doing so with the full cooperation of the Iraqi authorities.\nKuwait, however, as part of its efforts to ensure the continued imposition of the economic blockade upon the people of Iraq, along with the continued presence of the United States forces in the region, raises, from time to time, claims that are both baseless and untrue. Kuwait claims, for instance, that Iraq still detains a number of Kuwaiti civilians; and I want to \nstress from this rostrum that Iraq has returned all military Kuwaiti prisoners of war under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In fact, since 4 March 1991, 6,328 Kuwaitis have been returned. The only ones remaining are 17 Kuwaitis, already registered with ICRC and awaiting a decision from Kuwaiti authorities to receive them. Iraq has also submitted to ICRC a list of 3,536 Kuwaitis - constituting 606 families present in Iraq - in addition to another list of 159 other Kuwaitis.\nThe Kuwaiti side has not accepted the return of more than 170 of these registered Kuwaitis. Thus, it is the Kuwaiti authorities that bear full responsibility for obstructing the return of these Kuwaitis, who are registered with ICRC. Iraq has also advised the United Nations Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States as per its official memoranda dated 28 August 1991, in detail, of these facts and reiterated its willingness to cooperate with the Red Cross for all Kuwaitis present in Iraq to be delivered to the Kuwaiti side. We have also asked the United Nations and the League of Arab States to urge the Kuwaiti side to agree to receive these nationals. Furthermore, Iraq has requested the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to send a mission of investigation to ascertain the actual facts of this question. The Secretary-General of the League of Arab States has granted this request and the mission arrived in Baghdad two days ago. The Iraqi authorities will cooperate fully with the Arab League mission in order for the truth of the matter to be known.\nAnother chapter of Kuwaiti claims has been the episode of an alleged Iraqi military landing in Bubiyan Island, over which Kuwait made a tremendous political and propaganda noise. Kuwait filed a complaint with the Security Council, leading some Western countries and their allies to rush to condemn Iraq in the light of the allegations. Then, as soon as the investigations into the Kuwaiti claims were completed by the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait observation mission, the whole thing turned out to be a Kuwaiti hoax. Through allegations of this kind, the rulers of Kuwait want to ensure that States forces would be kept stationed in the region for as long as possible. The reports of the team of observers, as mentioned in the reports of the Secretariat of 23 September 1991, on the cease-fire between Iraq and Kuwait,\nattest to the adherence and cooperation of the Iraqi authorities with the team and the fact that there are no violations of the cease-fire by the Iraqi side whereas there are violations by the Kuwaiti forces.\nOn the other hand, the United States and its allies persist in their insistence on continuing the economic blockade against Iraq and the extortionist efforts aimed at burdening Iraq with the costs of destroying its own weapons and of establishing the compensation fund. In the meantime, more than 18 million Iraqis are being deprived of their food and medicine and, consequently, exposed to famine and deadly epidemics. The first victims amongst them are the children of Iraq. This has, in fact, been stressed by such United Nations missions as those headed by Assistant Secretary-General Marti Ahtisaari and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the joint mission of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the Harvard University team and ICRC.\nThe countries which raise the slogans of liberty, democracy and human rights are the very countries which indulge in the most heinous violations of the most basic human rights when they prevent the supply of foodstuffs, medical needs and other civilian materials to the people of Iraq. By imposing this blockade upon Iraq and its people they clearly violate international human-rights conventions, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights and, particularly, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Protocol annexed to it, all of which prohibit actions preventing food and medicine from reaching civilians, even in a situation of ongoing war. The Protocol also prohibits the starving of civilians for war objectives.\nSecurity Council resolution 706 (1991) goes in the opposite direction to the proposals made in the reports of the United Nations missions that visited Iraq. This resolution does not seek to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people by meeting their humanitarian needs so much as it tries to exploit the needs and suffering in order to impose such restrictions upon the Iraqi economy as have no precedent in history. This constitutes an infringement of the sovereignty of Iraq and interference in its internal affairs, in violation of the United Nations Charter and of all norms and rules of international law.\nSecurity Council resolution 706 (1991) seeks, in effect, to maintain indefinitely the imposition of the economic blockade, which is contrary to the provisions contained in paragraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991). Security Council resolution 706 (1991) considers it sufficient to give Iraq the very minimum of its food and medical needs - enough only to prevent people from being starved to death - without allowing Iraq to engage in the reconstruction required to undo the horrible destruction inflicted by the military aggression upon its economy in the fields of agriculture, irrigation, communications, bridges, health care and the oil industry.\nSecurity Council resolution 706 (1991) seeks, in fact, to pressurize Iraq into relinquishing its oil resources to the control of the forces of aggression and placing its economic requirements and monetary policy hostage to the will of a small group of States that has assigned to itself the role of guardian of the people of Iraq, cancelling the role of the country's Government and drawing out for this purpose a mechanism that is impossible to implement.\nHence, Security Council resolution 706 (1991), which was originally meant to meet the economic and humanitarian needs of Iraq and its people, has turned out to run counter to the Charter of the United Nations and to impose foreign hegemony over the independent will of the people of Iraq. Furthermore, thin resolution torpedoes the provisions of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) permitting Iraq to purchase foodstuffs, medicines and other civilian needs without hegemony or interference.\nIt is relevant to refer here to the wide media fuss raised over the last few days concerning the group of observers currently in Iraq, headed by Mr. David Kay. In this respect, I must mention the following facts. The formula for the submission of documents and other material by the observer teams requires that the documents and material be registered in the record signed by both parties. Moreover, materials are to be described and photographed in order to prevent any tampering with or additions to originals. But, in fact, the inspection team insisted on seizing large quantities of documents without complying with the proper procedures. Furthermore, from the beginning the head of the team refused to comply with these procedures. As if the havoc that he had wreaked were not sufficient, he went so far as to try to seize the personal files of employees in the field of energy. These files included only addresses, photographs and personal details.\nOn the one hand, this has no basis in the relevant Security Council resolutions, and goes far beyond the functions of the inspection team; on the other hand, it jeopardizes the lives of these officials, as the files will inevitably fall into the hands of foreign intelligence organizations and, consequently, reach the Israeli Mossad. It is well known that this criminal agency targeted, and even assassinated, a number of workers in the atomic energy industry in Iraq.\nLastly, it behoves me to state that the present inspection team is headed by David Kay, who made this fuss. It was he who made a similar fuss against Iraq last June.\nThe other 12 groups of inspectors to visit Iraq completed their work quietly and expressed their appreciation for the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities. The repetition of events in this a manner and their timing - at the beginning of the General Assembly session, when a climate could be created sympathetic to the Iraqi people and its cause, a climate that could favour lifting the economic blockade from our children, elderly people and women - shows that the team's intention was to create a tense, anti-Iraq climate. This confirms what we have said before, namely that this person is following tendentious instructions that are not in consonance with the functions with which the United Nations has entrusted him.\nWhat we have seen of the so-called new world order clearly suggests that it is going to be a unipolar order which ignores the needs and interests of developing countries. It will be an order established on the basis of positions and decisions dictated by one country or a handful of countries, positions and decisions designed to suit the narrow interests of those countries in a selective double-standard manner alien to the principles of justice and fairness enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nWhat we have seen so far of the features of that new world order are no more than flagrant practices of interference in the internal affairs of other States, massive disregard for the rights of the Palestinian people, who continue to live under foreign occupation and control, and selective policies permitting certain countries to arm themselves with the weapons of their choice, including nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, while on the other hand imposing a total embargo on other countries.\nThere are many examples of the double-standard criteria adopted by some States, led by the United States. I shall confine myself to an example relating to Iraq. When Iraq takes measures to protect security and stability within its territory against the murder, pillage and sabotage perpetrated by bands of infiltrators, traitors and foreign agents. Western forces interfere, even militarily, to protect those terrorists. Yet, when Turkey launches military raids and offensives inside Iraqi territory, on the pretext of attacking saboteurs and terrorists who had fled from Turkey, the United States, in statements by its top officials, declares its support for such action.\nAs far the question of Palestine, it is the most flagrant example in this respect. While many countries call for the implementation of international legitimacy and try to hide their illegitimate acts against Iraq behind that slogan, some of them continue to ignore the rights of the Palestinian people while United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian issue remain un-implemented and while the forces of Zionist occupation continue their policy of annexing occupied Arab lands, build settlements on them, carry out schemes for Jewish immigration and employ the ugliest methods of repression against helpless men, women and children.\nJustice, fairness and the principles of the United Nations Charter demand that the international community stand by the Palestinian people in its plea for the right of self-determination on its own Palestinian soil, like any other people that regained its independence, and for the chance to exercise its undeniable, inalienable rights and to establish an independent State, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PL0), its sole legitimate representative.\nBut today, we are witnessing attempts to marginalize the role of the United Nations and ignore its decisions aimed at finding a solution to the\nPalestinian question. The United Nations must play a major effective role in this sphere and in the implementation of its resolutions on the Palestinian issue. The first thing that must be implemented is Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian territories, including Holy Al-Quds, and all the other Arab territories. There must also be a halt to the mass immigration of Jews from the Soviet Union and other countries and their settlement in occupied Palestine.\nAny measures that ignore the fact that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people would be tantamount to an attempt to impose a solution on the Palestinian people from outside; that we must not accept.\nHe stress that Iraq's principled position is to support the Palestinian people, led by the PLO, in its struggle to regain all its inalienable rights. That principled Iraqi position, coupled with the strong resolve of the people and the leadership of Iraq to confront Zionist and imperialist schemes which target the future of the Palestinian people and the Arab nation as a whole, prompted Zionist and imperialist circles, and those allied to and colluding with them to launch their 30-State aggression aimed at destroying Iraq and its capabilities.\nAt the conclusion of my statement, I want to draw the attention of Member States to the fundamental goal of the founding of this Organization: to preserve the sovereignty of peoples over their territories and safeguard their right to live in freedom and dignity.\nThe Assembly is now faced with the tragic human situation that has befallen the people of Iraq, which has been making a considerable contribution to progress, justice and humanity for more than 6,000 years. That people is \nfacing the spectre of the worst kind of starvation and disease as a result of the unjust economic blockade, whose first victims are children, woman, the elderly and other Innocent civilians.\nTherefore, this Organisation, whose Charter promotes the dignity of the Individual, faces a test of its conscience and humanity. History will make its judgement in the light of how the United Nations conducts itself and how its addresses this tragic situation.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica I congratulate Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I also wish to express my appreciation to his predecessor, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Malta, for the able manner in which he presided over the forty-fifth session and for his efforts to streamline the work of the General Assembly.\nWe take very special pleasure in welcoming the seven new Member States of this Organisation: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All these have now joined the family of nations. We are sure that they will make valuable contributions to the work of the United Nations and the strengthening of the world community.\nOnly a few days after this Assembly was privileged to hear an eloquent address from the first democratically elected President of Haiti, we were shocked to hear of his ouster by a section of the Haitian Army which now calls itself the government of Haiti. The universal condemnation and repudiation of this dastardly act gives the assurance that this interruption of the democratic process in Haiti will be only temporary. It is gratifying to note that the countries of this hemisphere have reacted immediately, not merely with condemnation but with action.\nThe Organization of American States, at a meeting of the Foreign Ministers held in Washington last night, which was addressed by President Aristide himself, has declared an absolute commitment to taking whatever steps are necessary to assist the Haitian people in restoring the legitimate Government of President Aristide, and in the shortest possible time. My country, Jamaica, along with our Caribbean Community partners, pledges full support to the steps it is proposed to take in the next few days, and we call on the whole international community to join us in ensuring that the democratic and human rights of the Haitian people are speedily restored.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, is nearing the end of a dedicated and distinguished period of service to the United Nations. My Government takes this opportunity to express our admiration for the patient and persistent manner in which he has tackled a variety of complex and difficult issues and the contribution that he has made to enhancing the prestige and authority of the United Nations in its efforts to realize the noble principles of its Charter. He has earned and deserves profound appreciation and gratitude from us all.\nThe world his successor will confront is in many respects significantly different from the one in which our present Secretary-General began his stewardship. The cold war has ended. In consequence there is a suspension of ideological polarization and a lifting of the threat of a nuclear holocaust through super-Power confrontations, which were the two defining characteristics of the post-war era.\nAt long last the process of dismantling the arsenal of nuclear weapons has begun in a significant way. The announcement by President Bush of a number of unilateral actions to be taken by the United States in this regard will no doubt in due course be matched by corresponding actions on the part of the Soviet Union. \nThe developing rapprochement between the super-Powers which has marked the closing years of the decade of the 1980s has strengthened the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its peace-keeping role and has been conducive to the creation of an atmosphere that has enhanced the search for solutions in a number of troubled areas in the world.\nOne of the most dramatic consequences of this change in the world situation was the decisive and effective way in which the world community was able to react to the Gulf crisis brought on by the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. It has also opened up a new window of opportunity for a lasting solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and there is now the very real possibility of a Middle East peace conference being convened in the near future. While no one underestimates the formidable difficulties that still stand in the way of a resolution of this situation, it is heartening to observe that there does appear to be at least a new willingness to look for fruitful compromises that will replace the destructive confrontations of the past.\nOn the African continent, the Government of Angola and UNITA have signed peace accords to end the civil war in that country. In South Africa the long-heralded winds of change have at last begun to blow with a force that we can now feel confident will in the foreseeable future totally demolish the system of apartheid. This year we welcomed the repeal of legislation that constituted the formal framework and the main pillars of that system. Progress is also being made in meeting the requirements of the United Nations Declaration on Apartheid adopted by consensus in December 1989. An agreement has been reached between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the South African authorities regarding the voluntary repatriation of South African refugees and political exiles.\nPresident De Klerk has also proposed a programme of constitutional reform which, while still far from the ultimate objective of full representational democracy, at least provides a platform on which meaningful negotiations can be based. Some countries have responded to these developments by the lifting of sanctions against South Africa in varying degrees. It is our belief, however, that some of these steps are premature. It is the force of international pressure that has brought the South African regime to its present position of conciliation and reform. That pressure must continue to be maintained, albeit in a measured and graduated way, until the full objective of a genuinely democratic, non-racial South Africa is achieved.\nIn July of this year the Government and people of Jamaica were proud and honoured to welcome to our shores the distinguished, courageous and outstanding leader of the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela, and to be able to assure him personally of our continued support in his efforts to end apartheid through peaceful negotiations.\nIn the region to which my country belongs - Latin America and the Caribbean - there is a good deal on the current scene that we can view with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.\nIn Central America progress has been made in El Salvador towards the achievement of a political settlement. We welcome the broad agreement reached last week under the auspices of the United Nations between the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Naeional (FMLN), which constitutes a major breakthrough in the search for national reconciliation. \nWe are particularly pleased to note that Guatemala has now formally recognised the sovereignty and Independence of Belize and that the two Governments have now decided to establish full diplomatic relations and are continuing negotiations to achieve a full and final settlement of their dispute. \nThe major outstanding issue of concern in the political landscape of the region is, of course, the continuing posture of confrontation that exists between Cuba and the United States, This is one of the few remaining legacies of the cold war. While there is full appreciation of the deep-seated political and psychological barriers that stand in the way of their reconciliation, there is no doubt that the Governments and peoples of the region would welcome some movement on the part of both countries that could eventually lead to the full reintegration of Cuba into the family of nations of this hemisphere.\nOne of the striking features of recent developments in this hemisphere that augurs well for the future has been the rapidly increasing trend towards trade and economic integration. At the same time, the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative launched by the United States Administration signals a most welcome reaffirmation that the United States will not abandon its historic commitment to furthering the economic well-being of the region as a whole.\nAll these developments have understandably evoked the vision of a new world order based upon the universal acceptance of democratic forms of government, operating under the rule of law, guaranteeing full recognition of basic human rights and promoting the empowerment of the individual citizen within a liberalized economic system.\nEven while holding fast to this vision of the future, however, we should not make the mistake of assuming that Utopia is at hand. In human affairs every advance towards new forms of political and economic organizations, however meritorious in itself, inevitably brings new challenges and unforeseen problems. \nAlready we have seen that the dissolution of the monolithic, economic and political organisation of Central and Eastern Europe has unleashed long dormant antagonistic forces of nationalist and ethnic rivalry. It has also demolished a structure of economic organisation that, however imperfectly and unsatisfactorily, did function to produce a mutually supportive trading regime. With its disappearance the threat of economic chaos leading to social and political instability in that whole region is a danger that the world community cannot ignore.\nNeither can we ignore the current internal struggle in Yugoslavia. Still less can the international community be indifferent to the Herculean task facing the Soviet Union as it seeks to redefine the relationship between the several republics to the central authority and to each other. Whatever result emerges from this is bound to have a profound effect on a vast range of international issues and on the nature and character of the emerging new world order.\nIn a formal sense, of course, these could be regarded as internal problems. Clearly however, their resolution will have profound external and international repercussions. This indicates a possible need in the world community as a whole, and this Organization in particular, to rethink the boundaries if not indeed the whole concept of the rigid dichotomy between internal and international issues and to seek to define ways in which the international community, without impairing the principle of sovereignty, and the right to self-determination, can assist countries to find solutions to those internal problems which, if left unattended, can have grave consequences for us all. \nTo the challenges that arise from the disappearance of the old landmarks that defined the bipolar world of the post-war era must, of course, be added the unfinished agenda of those issues that have been increasingly occupying the attention of this Organization. Foremost among these, of course, are the economic issues of development and trade; the increasingly uneven distribution of world production; the phenomenon of increasing impoverishment of large sections of the planet in both relative and absolute terms when compared with the increasing affluence of a much smaller fraction of the world's peoples. This constitutes the most outstanding legacy of the decade just ended which needs to be urgently addressed.\nThis unhappy divergence is taking place, not only between nations, but within nations, and even the most affluent are beginning to be aware of the real consequences for political stability and social order if this trend is not halted and reversed.\nIn my own region - Latin America and the Caribbean - despite the efforts made by Governments to adopt and promote appropriate macro-economic policies and to undertake far-reaching measures of structural adjustment, it is nevertheless true that economic and social progress continues to be elusive.\nThe debt crisis which is now entering its second decade has for many countries in this hemisphere become a permanent debilitating condition denying the possibility of economic growth and threatening the collapse of social services. It is, of course, true that some important steps have been taken by a number of creditor countries in relation to bilateral debt and, in addition, a number of debt strategies to deal with commercial debt have achieved some measure of success. However, in order to achieve any lasting progress, sustained international action is required on an even more focused and global scale. In particular the international financial institutions need to rethink their own policies in relation to the restructuring and refinancing of debts owed them, particularly by those developing countries with fragile economies that find themselves in the anachronistic position of being net contributors to those institutions.\nIn addition, these financial institutions, which have for a variety of reasons acquired a controlling power over the internal economic policies of a number of developing countries, need to keep under continual review the relevance and efficacy of their traditional prescriptions. These prescriptions, if not applied with flexibility and imagination and with close attention to the political realities of each country, can become a part of the problem rather than a part of the solution.\nInternational cooperation in the promotion and encouragement of human rights is an abiding principle of the Charter. This Organization has relentlessly pursued these goals by seeking out and correcting violations wherever they are deemed to occur and has achieved marked success in many areas.\nIt is therefore appropriate that the General Assembly will convene a World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 to review and assess the work of the Organization in this field. This Conference provides an opportune occasion for renewal of the standards and the aspirations which are of fundamental importance to achieving a more humane world based on equality and justice.\nThe support of the international community should not, however, be confined to civil and political rights, important though these are, but should instead be extended to include those economic, social and cultural rights that in the final analysis give meaning and content to political democracy and individual freedom. In practical terms this implies recognition that social betterment and a more equitable distribution of the fruits of the productive process must go hand in hand with economic growth. Indeed, experience has shown that sustainable economic development requires the increasing participation at increasing levels of skill and commitment of the individual men and women of society in the productive process. This will not be forthcoming without an adequate response to the social needs of education, health care, decent housing conditions, as well as a perception that the wealth of the society is being shared in an equitable manner. Jamaica is seeking to establish these conditions in its strategy for the nation's future growth. Our national five-year development plan, 1990-1995 states: \\\"We must start by putting the human being fit the centre of our concern. The building of our human capital is an overriding priority.\\\"\nWe therefore strongly support all efforts to ensure that social issues have a prominent place in all programmes of international cooperation between States and within the United Nations itself.\nThe illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances constitutes a continued and menacing social, economic and health threat worldwide.\nJamaica welcomes and appreciates the establishment of the new United Nations drug control programme which was achieved earlier this year. This development will enable the United Nations to act snore effectively as the main focus for international drug abuse control, as is envisaged in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly. It is also an important step towards enhancing coordination and coherence in the international anti-drug programmes overseen by the United Nations, and also in the provision of broader assistance to individual countries.\nIt is Jamaica's unwavering intention, as has been repeatedly stated, to continue to utilize all available resources and to devote its full and united efforts nationally, bilaterally, regionally and in the international arena to attain the agreed and necessary objective of the total eradication of the drug menace.\nYet another challenge facing the world community is the task of ensuring that our development policies in the developing countries and the production of an ever-increasing range of the artefacts of affluent societies are consistent with the goals of global environmental security and are ecologically sustainable. On the one hand the demands of sheer survival in poverty-stricken countries do result in unacceptable environmental destruction while on the other hand high levels of production and consumption in the industrialized countries generate the largest part of the current emission of pollutants and devour, without adequate provision for replacement, the existing raw material resources of the planet. The 1992 Conference on Environment and Development for which we are now preparing will provide us with a timely opportunity to demonstrate the political commitment to forge a new global partnership designed to protect and preserve the natural environment. Such a partnership must take into account the varying levels of responsibilities, the differing economic capacities and needs and in some cases the particular vulnerabilities that characterize the various countries of the world.\nIf the developing countries are to participate effectively in this global endeavour, then the need must be recognized to provide financial and technological resources, to support environmental conservation programmes on terms that these countries can afford. It is worth mentioning, for example, that it has already been conservatively estimated by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean that approximately $US 10 billion in financing will be needed annually to make that region's development environmentally sustainable.\nIn this context I should also like to make special mention of the need to complete the ratification of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. That Convention provides a universal legal framework for the rational management of marine resources, for their conservation and for the fruits of their exploitation to be distributed and enjoyed in a just and equitable manner. \nWe urge the Governments which have not yet done so to ratify the Convention so that we can begin to establish a new regime of cooperation in the management of this important area of our planet.\nAs we reflect upon the demands that will be placed upon this Organisation in the years ahead to deal with both new and old challenges in an effective way it seems clear that the most urgent question facing the new Secretary-General will be whether the structure and operational modalities of the Organisation, fashioned as they were in a different era, are adequate to provide the dynamic leadership and confidence in that leadership that the world community needs and requires at this time.\nThe Rio Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries has put forward in a document submitted in the Assembly, some ideas, proposals and suggestions for improving the capabilities of the United Nations and, as a member of that Group, I commend these proposals to the attention of the world community.\nThe Secretary-General himself in his report to the Assembly has put us further in his debt by providing an insightful analysis of the current state of the Organization with a very frank identification of those areas that are in need of strengthening and reform. Without attempting to discuss the detailed recommendations in these documents, I may say that two very clear guidelines emerge. If the Organization is to have the moral authority to contribute significantly to the range of political, economic and social issues that confront the world community, its decision-making processes must be both transparent and reflective of the will of the majority of its Members. If the democratic principle is, as we believe, the right prescription for individual nations, than it should also be recognized as the objective to be sought in the international arena subject always of course to the right of individual nations to protect their vital interests and their national security. This requires us to ensure that the General Assembly it the forum where issues of global interest are not only discussed but are decided and implemented. That it the first guideline.\nThe second is that in order for decisions to be implemented effectively, the central Secretariat and the specialised agencies must be adequately funded and appropriately empowered. In so far as the Secretary-General's office itself is concerned, member States should be prepared to support and encourage the dynamic political role for that office envisaged by Article 99 of the Charter.\nMembers can be assured that my country will give its full support to all constructive proposals for strengthening and enhancing the work of this great Organisation, which represents mankind's best hope for a world of peace, orderly economic progress and social justice.\n"

I should also like to express appreciation of the wise manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Foreign Minister of Malta, conducted the work of the last session.\nLikewise, I wish to renew our appreciation and gratitude for the active role of Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, who has effectively contributed to the enhancement of the United Nations role and has given shape to the principles and purposes of its Charter in many fields of international life.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction with the contents of the Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly at this session. We agree with his analysis of the world situation and the role of the world Organisation, especially his emphasis on the necessity of respecting the Charter and international law.\nIt is a source of pride for me to stand before the international community as representative of Yemen more than a year after the struggle of the Yemeni people was crowned with achievement of the great goal of unification. This unification is the incarnation of our people's hopes and aspirations throughout its long struggle. This historic event represents our modest contribution to the changes now taking place in many parts of the world, changes which herald the emergence of a new world order. We take pride in the fact that the unification of Yemen is a unique experience in our region. This unification has brought down, once for all, the walls that separated the two parts of Yemen. With the unification, another wall was brought down - namely, that which forced the world to deal with a divided Yemen. Our people has achieved its political unification, peacefully and democratically, on the basis of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, adopted through the popular referendum of May 1991. This Constitution has become our guiding light for building a new Yemen that enjoys freedom, democracy, justice and equality. It is the cornerstone of the institutions through which all Yemeni citizens may exercise their full rights and actively participate in political life and the processes of economic development in our country.\nAs we speak about democracy and equality, which are prerequisites of building a unified society in Yemen, we condemn from this rostrum the coup d'etat that ousted the democratic Government of Haiti and call for the restoration of the elected President. Now that Yemen has been unified, we can clearly voice our hope that there will emerge a new world order, which will bring to all peoples freedom, equality and social and political justice. Our hope is nourished by the developments which have spared humanity the risks of the cold war and helped avert the damage of nuclear confrontation. In this respect, we are pleased to welcome the initiative by President George Bush of the United States of America to remove certain categories of nuclear weapons. We hope that this will be the beginning of disarmament in the area of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and that, as such, it will open the road to a process of full and real disarmament, which would rid the world not only of nuclear, but also of other overkill weapons.\nIt is heartening to watch the consequences of those new developments. They have led to the unification of Germany and the independence of the three Baltic Republics, which have recently been admitted to membership of the United Nations. This is a welcome development. We also welcome the accession of the two Korean States, since we believe that their membership of the United Nations will bring the Organization closer to universality. We sincerely hope that the Korean people will achieve unification by peaceful and democratic means. I should also like to express our pleasure at the accession by the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to the membership of the United Nations. This, in our view, is further testimony that the goal of United Nations universality is being pursued.\nThose positive developments in international relations have also paved the way for the start of serious efforts aimed at settling many regional problems, such as those of Cyprus, Western Sahara, southern Africa, Angola, El Salvador, Afghanistan, Cambodia and others. Conversely, the crisis in the Gulf erupted in a manner which ran counter to the principles that govern relations between States, principles which we all observe and respect. Those principles include the non-use of force in the settlement of disputes, the inadmissibility of the violation of the sovereignty of an independent State, and the inadmissibility of the acquisition of the lands of others by force. On the basis of this constant premise, and of our appreciation of the potential dangers inherent in this crisis, the leadership of the Republic of Yemen made relentless efforts to contain and resolve the crisis peacefully and in a brotherly fashion on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereign rights of every Arab State.\nToday, in the aftermath of all the complications and the grave military developments witnessed by the region, we feel that our national Arab duty and our geographic location, by virtue of which we are an integral part of the Arabian peninsula and the Red Sea, make it incumbent upon us to redouble our efforts to avert the dangers that threaten the security and stability of our region, to put an end to the consequences of the war that took place there, and to normalise the situation in the area. To achieve this, all the countries of the region should put this phase behind them and intensify their concerted efforts to improve the lot of our peoples and to save the region from a repetition of the recent grave developments that have adversely affected our Arab causes and threatened our future.\nWe believe that we still have the time and the opportunity to transcend the present stagnation in relations between the countries of the region. Cooperation and brotherliness should replace war and confrontation. If Europe, with all its different nationalities and past conflicts, has managed to build cooperation on common denominators, we must realize that the bonds that unite us are bonds not only of nationality and religion but also of a common history, geography, language, culture and a common destiny.\nThis goal should be achieved through candour and truthfulness in analysing the crisis that befell the region, putting aside any insistence on the correctness of this or that individual position. We are all required to work towards the normalisation of our relations and the restoration of peace in our region on a solid and sound basis characterised by mutual respect for sovereignty and independence, non-interference in internal affairs, and the exchange of benefits for the good of all the peoples of the area.\nAll countries of the region, including Iraq, must take part in this process. To begin with, the people of Iraq should be enabled to get over its plight. This requires the return of prisoners and hostages to their families. For humanitarian reasons now accepted by most countries, it is necessary also that the international community lifts the economic blockade imposed upon the Iraqi people. It is essential that the Iraqi people should be enabled to reconstruct their country, repair the damage caused by the war, and to live normally. All Iraqi citizens - especially the elderly, women and children - should be assured of a decent life, including the provision of food, medicines and shelter, like every other people in the region and indeed in the world as a whole.\nOur collective responsibility makes it incumbent upon us to work together with the countries of the region. This is not only natural but urgent. He should also work to remove the barriers between the countries of the region. This is essential if our region is to have security and stability, and if it is to be spared the risks of tension and explosions. It should also help to achieve prosperity for our peoples. Moreover, it is our hope that the vigour and optimism generated by the Security Council's determined approach in applying Chapter VII of the Charter in dealing with the crisis in the Gulf will be consolidated further. We want it to be the rule, not the exception. We want it to reinforce the Council's position as a world authority that can enforce its resolutions by the various effective means at its disposal. In our view, this resolve has developed into a mechanism based on the fulfilment of the concepts and rules of the United Nations Charter.\nThis Organisation should persevere in applying such rules uniformly in addressing all International questions, foremost among which is the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, and especially the question of the Palestinian Arab people, which is the core of the conflict. Only such a serious and balanced approach would consolidate the credibility and seriousness of the international community. It should remove any double standards in the application of just laws and principles. In addition, it would help prevent the collapse of the pillars of a durable and just peace in the Middle East and the world as a whole. To this end, we must all work to develop and apply solid foundations for an international consensus on the Middle East question. In this regard, the most important fact is that no durable, just and comprehensive peace will ever be possible in the region unless the Palestinian people is enabled to exercise its inalienable national rights, and unless Israel withdraws completely from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including the holy city of Al-Quds and the other occupied Arab territories.\nWe in the Republic of Yemen look forward with optimism to the success of the peace initiative led by the United States of America. We hope that it will lead to just peace in our region. In this respect we believe that the resolutions and decisions of the Palestine National Council, which met recently in Algeria, will contribute positively and constructively to the success of peace efforts in the region. We call upon Israel to take a similar positive stand. It is also our view that if these endeavours are to succeed, all the unlimited political, economic, military and financial support that Israel receives should cease. In addition, the Security Council should not be prevented from exercising the power it possesses under the Charter in acting against Israel, whose record is replete with unpunished and unhindered violations of the Charter and with constant and blatant rejection of the resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly. If peoples are not to be disappointed, and if United Nations resolutions are not to lose their credibility, the international community must urgently put an end to Israel's non-compliance with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions that declare the annexation of Al-Quds null and void. The international community should also put pressure on Israel to desist from its policy and practice of confiscating, and settling Jewish immigrants on, Palestinian lands, as well as all its other suppressive and oppressive measures that constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations, principles of international law and relevant international agreements. \nIt is high time that an end is put to Israel's annexation of the Syrian Golan and its continued occupation of southern Lebanon. Also, we emphasize that the cornerstone for establishing a durable and just peace lies in granting the Palestinian people its right to self-determination on its national soil under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nWe call upon those countries which are assisting the immigration of Jews to halt that immigration, which must lead to the expansion of the policy of settlement in the occupied Palestinian and Arab lands. These countries should put pressure on Israel to put a stop to the building of settlements in the occupied territories. In this context, we renew our call for strong international measures to eliminate Israel's nuclear armaments, especially in view of the grave dangers these weapons pose to the whole region.\nMy country, which belongs to the group of least developed countries, still suffers the economic ills associated with being such a country. Accordingly, we believe that the future of the new world order will be determined not only by progress on the political level but also by concomitant achievements on the economic level. This prompts us, given the fact that developing countries form the majority in this Organization, to hope that our concerns in respect of overcoming our economic difficulties are felt to the same extent by our partners, the nations of the industrialized developed world.\nWe know that this is not an easy task. However, it will be the acid test of the success or failure of the international community's efforts to lay the foundations of the new world order. Unless the discrepancies are removed and the gap between rich and poor countries is at least narrowed and the economic barriers between developed and developing countries are lifted, every achievement will remain precarious. The deteriorating economic situation should be dealt with by our partners on the basis of equality and justice. This would guarantee continued interaction between us and our partners, which is an absolute must if a world economic collapse is to be averted at a time when we have high hopes for achieving economic progress in the wake of all the political gains we have witnessed so far.\nOur future options are clear. With concerted efforts by all, we can determine, at this historical juncture, the principal features of the transition to a new world order. Yemen will spare no effort in its endeavours to remain an active partner in the international community: we sincerely wish to work hard with the other countries of the world in order to consolidate international peace and security and promote stability, prosperity and social and economic progress for all peoples. We are hopeful that this session will initiate sincere efforts towards these goals.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\\\"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\nPraise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe\\\".\nThose are, my dear brothers and friends, the opening words of the Koran, the Holy Book of Muslims. Allah is the Lord of the universe, the Lord of the heavens, the earth and whatever there is in between; Allah is the Lord of all living creatures and of all human beings, irrespective of race or colour. God gave life to mankind in compassion, watches over human growth with the same compassion and enjoins us in all of revealed Scripture and in all the messages of His prophets to demonstrate that compassion. No human being is superior to another except on grounds of piety and noble humanitarian deeds. No human race is better than any other, and no skin colour is preferable to another.\nThat, my dear brothers and friends, is our fundamental premise. Therefore, we praise Allah, our Lord, Who, after millenniums had gone by, finally brought the human race to culminate its long struggle and learn from bitter experience with the vision and insight needed to place at its service a forum like the present one, where all States gather on an equal footing in a common endeavour to uphold righteousness and justice, to establish and maintain universal order and security, and to achieve welfare and peace for all.\nUntil recently, and even now, my country was, and continues to be, a living example of the international community's determination to attain those goals, even at the price of the use of force. It appears that certain people simply will not correct their conduct or rethink their positions except in the face of force. But, as my country's case has not yet been closed, I shall return to speak about it later in my statement. \n\nAllow me now, Mr. President, to take this opportunity to extend to you, on behalf of the State of Kuwait, our warn congratulations and my own personal best wishes on your election as President of the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. He are confident that your vast experience, together with your deep sense of commitment and determination, will bring us closer to attainment of the lofty humanitarian objectives of this world Organisation as it stands on the threshold of a new era. What augments our pleasure is the fact that you represent a sister State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which was uniquely honoured by God, The Almighty, to be the land where the divine message was revealed and to serve as the beacon of Islam and the home of the two Holy Mosques. Throughout its history, your country has steadfastly supported righteousness and justice and made enormous sacrifices in that regard. As a member of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) Kuwait perceives your election as recognition of the outstanding role of the GCC in international life.\nI wish also to express in the name of the people and Government of Kuwait our deep gratitude to Mr. Guido de Marco, the President of the last session of the General Assembly, for the achievements made under his wise leadership.\nIn addition, I would like to place on record the profound thanks and appreciation of the people of Kuwait, as well as my own personal gratitude, to His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his wise, painstaking and untiring efforts, combined with impressive impartiality, in doing the work of the United Nations.\nFurthermore, let me take this opportunity to extend our congratulations to the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands on\n\ntheir admission to the United Rations. This la yet further testimony to the growing constructive role played by this Organisation in the resolution of regional conflicts. It is our hope that these new Members will enhance the goals and purposes of the United Nations and promote world peace.\nLet me now go back to the time last year when from this rostrum I addressed the plight of my small, peaceful country, which had been invaded by the Iraqi regime in a bid to wipe it off the map of the world. What a difference there is between now and then! One year ago, as I was speaking here, the forces of aggression were wreaking havoc in my country. Today I am conveying to you, my dear brothers and friends, our gratitude and the aspirations of a State Member of this world body, whose land, freedom and dignity have been restored as a result of the honorable stand you took, a position predicated upon principles that are the underpinning of justice and the rule of international law.\nThat stand will go down in the annals of history as an outstanding achievement on the part of this Organization. The resolutions of the Security Council were enforced through the collective efforts exerted by many countries that have reaffirmed the overriding concern of the United Nations, namely, maintaining world peace and saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. This objective is clearly spelt out in the Charter. The admirable performance by the United Nations will perhaps serve as a sharp reminder to any party indulging delusions about brutalizing others in pursuit of false ambitions or brazen fantasies that the world Organization stands ready as a strong and effective deterrent.\nFrom the land of Kuwait I convey on behalf of its people sentiments of gratitude and appreciation to all those countries that rushed to our aid and to all those peoples that shared our pain as well as to all those leaders who \n\nresponded swiftly in defence of right and justice against an overwhelming onslaught of ruthless brutality and barbarism.\nIn the name of every Kuwaiti national, let me commend the thousands of men and women who risked their lives in the air, on land and at sea to defend a small peace-loving nation. In the final analysis, all those servicemen and servicewomen came to our land to defend the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. They were engaged in battle to ensure the security of all nations in the future and to preserve world peace.\nThe United Nations system - in particular, the Security Council, the specialized agencies and the Secretary-General - and all the individual countries that contributed to the collective defence of Kuwait and to upholding the principles of the United Nations, together with every soldier who risked his or her life in the process of supporting us, have all won a prominent place in the history of our country as well as in our national conscience.\nKuwait by itself was unable to repel an enemy of overwhelming strength and unspeakable savagery. Kuwait fought hard, with all it had to give, and the Kuwaiti people demonstrated impressive steadfastness in challenging the invaders in a fashion that won the admiration of the world. Hundreds of Kuwaitis fell martyrs or suffered wounds. The most bitter legacy of the invasion, however, is the destruction of the social fabric of Kuwait by brutal and barbaric acts. Families have been split up and people have been terrorized and oppressed by unwarranted acts of malicious vengeance inflicted even on the elderly, women and children, who are still suffering from deep psychological scars. The rehabilitation process requires painstaking efforts over an extended period of time.\n\nIn the same context, and in defiance of humanity as a whole, several thousands were taken prisoner or hostage to be subjected later to various forms of torture at the hands of the invaders. Thousands of these prisoners and hostages are still being held by the Iraqi regime In blatant violation of Security Council resolutions and the Islamic system of values, as well as in total disregard of international treaty commitments. May I from this podium address on behalf of Kuwait and its deeply afflicted people an appeal to the conscience of the world to ensure the freedom of those prisoners and hostages and to put an end to their suffering. Man, after all, is the most dignified of creatures, and it is totally inadmissible to use human beings as bargaining chips, as a means of bringing pressure to bear or as tools for blackmail.\nMy dear brothers and friends, you see before you a number of Kuwaiti children who represent many more who are appealing for your assistance in securing the release of their fathers, mothers, brothers or sisters who are still held by the Iraqi regime that is using them as a means of exploitation and blackmail. This is yet another uncalled-for human tragedy.\nA year ago, when I sought to describe the inhuman practices the Iraqi regime was imposing upon Kuwait and its people, institutions and landmarks, as well as upon the third-country nationals who were living peacefully in our country, I was extremely careful in choosing the words and phrases to evoke, on the basis of reports received from inside the country, the conditions prevailing in occupied Kuwait. I did so in a conscious effort to avoid any exaggeration and overstatement. With liberation achieved, now that we have seen the true situation first-hand, it is safe to say that the real dimensions of the tragedy exceed by far even the most lurid imagination of a writer of\n\nfiction. Words like \\\"murder,\\\" \\\"torture,\\\" \\\"humiliation,\\\" \\\"plunder\\\" and \\\"devastation\\\" cannot really do justice to the actual situation on the ground.\nWhat is astounding, however, is that crimes of this nature and on such a scale have been perpetrated at a time when the twentieth century is drawing to a close and when mankind is striving hard to gain better control over the universe by using science to optimise the exploitation of natural resources and to combat social evils in a collective human effort to promote a better life for all- By contrast, the Iraqi leadership, while committing these brutalities in flagrant violation of international legitimacy, tries to hide under the mantle of Islam, thus compounding its already monstrous crime by distorting a sacred God-sent message that sacrifices life in all its forms, human, animal and plant. The Koran and the sayings of our Prophet Mohammed - peace be upon him - are replete with phrases that underline that celebration of life.\nHaving made these points, I prefer not to dwell on the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Iraq regime. The far-reaching evil effects of those crimes will perhaps continue to affect Kuwait and the surrounding areas for decades to come. The tremendous devastation has been and will continue to be recorded by the missions dispatched by the United Nations, the regional organizations and the scientific community. However, despite the extensive damage inflicted by the Iraqi invasion on Kuwait's physical infrastructure and the heinous crimes perpetrated against man and life in all its forms - as demonstrated by setting fire to 732 oil wells - the reconstruction of Kuwait is now well under way. The revitalization process is a mammoth operation that represents a real challenge to the will of man and to our sense of determination to pursue life. We are confident that with God's help and with your support we will be able to restore our full infrastructure. \n\nFree Kuwait has opened its doors anew to embrace the returning Kuwaitis and to host, in keeping with its longstanding tradition, the foreign workers, technicians, doctors, teachers and businessmen thanks to whose assistance a modern society was developed in an atmosphere of harmony where all received education and medical care. In the meantime, given their experience, the people of Kuwait are determined not to compromise any of their cherished values or gains. Democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the enjoyment of national wealth by all are fundamental principles to which we will adhere even more scrupulously in the future.\nDespite the great demands upon us in terms of the reconstruction of our homeland, Kuwait will continue to provide development assistance to other countries to the extent our means will allow. We will also continue to cooperate with the Secretary-General in support of United Nations programmes seeking to improve the human situation. Kuwait will also maintain a strong presence in areas of activity aimed at narrowing the enormous economic gap separating North from South.\nThe case of Kuwait has shown in clear-cut terms the parameters of an emerging new world order, one that must be predicated upon the principles of justice and respect for the sovereignty of all States. Within the framework of that emerging order an urgent solution must be found to the question of Palestine on the basis of the implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions. Such a settlement should lead to an honourable end, once and for all, to the tragedy of the Palestinian people. It is our hope now that the ongoing peace efforts to convene a conference for peace in the Middle East will bear fruit so that the envisioned goals will be attained. A similar approach should be followed in dealing with Lebanon, a country with which we \n\nstand united by fraternal ties and which rightly deserves our full support in achieving stability. Towards that and sincere efforts should continue to be made to enforce the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIn our judgment, the resolution of both the Palestinian and the Lebanese problems will bring about peace and security throughout the Middle East.\nKuwait pursues a policy of harmony and peace inspired by international law and the new world order. Such an order can be consolidated by the power of law and international legitimacy and the use of the powers provided for in the Charter of the United Nation with a view to impose peace.\nLiberated Kuwait will stay the course it has unfailingly pursued in the past, namely, to build bridges of friendship and harmony and to be an advocate of peace. The only difference between yesterday and today is that now we have a sharper and deeper sense of the meaning of peace, along with a greater faith in the emerging world order that will uphold justice, preserve rights and foster welfare and peace.\nPeace is the essence and thrust of all divinely revealed faiths. That is the message of our religion. The letters that form the two Arabic words As-salam - \\\"Peace\\\" - ana Al-Islam are the same. In this vein, may I recite from the Holy Koran a verse that echoes this universal call: \\\"0 ye who believe! \\\"Enter into Islam; \\\"Whole-heartedly; \\\"And follow not \\\"The footsteps \\\"Of the Evil One; \\\"For he is to you\n\\\"An avowed enemy.\\\" \n\nDear brothers and friends, I began this statement by expressing words of thanks to all of you, and I close by reiterating the same sentiments of acknowledgement and gratitude to you all. May God bring peace to all of you.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, Sir, I should like to express my most sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is indeed my earnest hope that under your leadership, this Assembly, which is meeting at such a crucial juncture of new international circumstances, will take constructive steps towards the enhancement of international peace, security and cooperation.\nI also take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea on their recent admission to the United Nations. Now that the two Koreas have joined the United Nations, I hope that the longstanding aspirations of the Korean people for unity will soon materialise.\nIn the course of the past few years, the world has undoubtedly undergone unprecedented developments, the most significant being, one might surmise, the crashing collapse of communism after 70 years of what was made to appear as unchallenged rule. I find this an opportune moment to congratulate the people and leadership of the Soviet Union on such an historic triumph, and to express my satisfaction at the realization of the aspirations of the people of the Soviet Union. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which shares extensive borders with a\nnumber of Soviet Republics, follows the developments in this country with great interest. Moreover, in the light of its friendly relations with the central Government and many commonalities with its Asian Republics, the Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to the promotion and expansion of bilateral cooperation with the Soviet Union and its Republics.\nToday, the most important issues on the international agenda relate to the future structure of international relations and the concept of a new world order. The world after the cold war needs a new order; this is indisputable for the simple reason that the past order governing international relations has been unjust and inherently unstable. Therefore, now that the bipolar world that used to exist has all but crumbled - and gone with it, albeit, not fully, the past suspicions and rivalries which overshadowed the principles of the Charter - there seems to exist a golden opportunity for a new world order: a new order founded on the United Nations Charter and the principles of justice, peace, security, equality, mutual respect for sovereignty and the territorial Integrity of States, and for the cultural and moral values of all nations. Under the present circumstances, it is necessary that views be exchanged on the definition and formulation of the world order in such international forums as the United Nations General Assembly, which comprises almost all members of the international community.\nUndoubtedly, the universality, acceptability and success of the new order can be guaranteed only through the active and serious participation of all members of the international community, particularly the third-world countries, which have thus far had little, if any, role in shaping the international order. Divine values should guide the process of the formulation and implementation of the future order; this imperative would ensure a healthy and sound order and preclude the recurrence of past aberrations and failures.\nBased on the principles just mentioned, I should like to outline the elements that would constitute the future world order:\nFirst, the United Nations should play a central role in guiding and coordinating the new world order. As such, it is incumbent on the Organization to rely on and operate in consonance with the views of its membership, and to distance itself from the traditional influence of the mighty - an unfortunate hallmark of the past unjust order. For the United Nations to play such a role, it needs to be strengthened in various fields. The issue of the revitalization of the United Nations, which is central to the Organisation's relevance and its new role in the future order, needs to be addressed in earnest by all Members. Reappraisal of the structure, operating procedure and performance of the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Secretariat, as the three main organs, figures prominently in this process. It should be borne in mind, however, that the issue of revitalization is of a functional nature, and, as such, should not lead to controversy involving national interests.\nSecondly, universal respect for human rights, as an important objective of mankind, is destined to occupy a place of distinction in the future world order. The exalted and sublime worth of the human person does not allow for monopoly by a particular system of thought or for manipulation for ulterior objectives. In order to ensure universal respect for human rights, mechanisms and arrangements are needed to widen and enrich the philosophical and conceptual foundations of human rights through an honest and vigorous consideration of the religions, traditions and cultures of various societies. This also entails a balanced emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights in parallel with civil and political rights. Furthermore, the well-placed emphasis on humanitarian aspects in the future order makes imperative, inter alia, the provision of practical measures to promote and expedite the efficacy of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations arising out of natural disasters and social and political crises. The inadequacy of international assistance to deal with the most basic needs created by the recent huge influx of Iraqi refugees into the Islamic Republic of Iran in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis clearly underlined the debilitating lack of well-established mechanisms for a prompt and adequate international response.\nThirdly, if history is any indication, the stability and non-violent preservation of any system depend on economic justice. Hence, for the new world order to succeed it is imperative that it be constructed in such a way that it would, among other things, enable the developing countries - by providing the necessary structural mechanisms and guarantees and the conducive milieu - to devote their actual a, well as their potential resources, both intellectual and material, to the evolution from the present unenviable state of desperate underdevelopment and stagnation into productive and creative societies consonant with and worthy of human dignity, The Secretary-General's treatment, in his report on the work of the Organisation, of the world economic situation in general and, in particular, of the ever-deteriorating position of most of the developing countries amply illustrates the gloomy economic situation in the larger part of the world. Although the responsibility for solving economic problems at the national level rests first and foremost with the countries concerned, no national effort, however vigorous, can prove to be viably sustainable unless it is viewed within the context of a common responsibility of the world community and, more importantly, unless it is supported by appropriate arrangements, the conducive milieu, and effective international assistance.\nFourthly, preservation of the environment as the common heritage of mankind, and also as an asset for future generations, has fortunately received the ever-increasing attention of the world community. This positive trend deserves further accentuation in the new order. Since the negative consequences of the pollution of the environment cannot be contained within national boundaries, a proper approach calls for common responsibility, cooperation and coordinated action at the international level. Such a common responsibility requires that practical measures be devised to facilitate the transfer of environmentally sound technology, as well as the extension of technical assistance for combating environmental pollution in developing countries.\nFifthly, in the wake of the collapse of the bipolar world, disarmament, and particularly the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, deserves to receive special priority. For even today, such concepts as nuclear deterrence, pre-emptive strike and offensive military doctrines are virtually fading, and so should the weapons that correspond to them.\nThe progress in the work of the Conference on Disarmament on the conclusion of the comprehensive convention on the prohibition of the production, development, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is indeed commendable, It is our earnest hope that that convention will soon be concluded, thereby removing once and for all the danger of such weapons of mass destruction, which have taken a very heavy toll during the past decade. That, however, should not in any way entail discrimination against the third-world countries, particularly so far as development of their chemical industries for peaceful purposes is concerned. In the future world order, regional arms control can contribute to the enhancement of the process of general disarmament when placed in the context of a global arms control programme. Furthermore, the acceptability and success of any programme for regional arms control depend on ensuring the security of the countries of each region against threats emanating from within and outside their respective regions as well as on a non-discriminatory approach towards the weapons and the countries to which the programme will apply.\nSixthly, following the erosion of the climate of contention in the former bipolar world, propitious conditions have emerged for the resolution of regional disputes, which have emanated for the most part from super-Power rivalry. The settlement of a number of such crises over the past two years signals an encouraging trend, and in this connection the valuable efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations are indeed commendable. The United Nations, with its primary role in guiding the future world order, should endeavour to resolve the remaining regional crises through a new approach founded on promoting commonalities of values and interests among countries of each region, as well as on regional cooperation. Such an approach, which would foster the establishment of regional security and cooperation schemes in various regions, will also contribute to confidence-building, thus removing some of the causes of possible future regional conflagrations.\nWithin that context I should like briefly to examine three major regional crises that have attracted international attention in the course of the past several decades.\nThe Iraqi aggression against Kuwait and its consequences, which in the course of the past year have preoccupied the international community and particularly the United Nations, brought to the fore the necessity of dealing with the fundamental and long-term problems of the strategic Persian Gulf region. The bitter experience of the Persian Gulf war, which made clear the sources of stability and tension in our region, has demonstrated that security in the Persian Gulf region is attainable only through the expansion of relations and cooperation among the countries in the area. In our view, arrangements for security and cooperation in the Persian Gulf should be based on two fundamental principles.\nFirst, the success of any arrangement for regional security and cooperation rests primarily on the common values and interests of the regional countries concerned. Deep-rooted bonds of religion, culture, history and commerce, as well as economic, political and international interests shared by the Persian Gulf countries, can naturally facilitate the achievement of this objective.\nThe second fundamental principle is that any security regime in the area has to be based on cooperation and confidence-building rather than on competition and a bloc formation, because in a competitive scenario inter-State relations tend to be based on mistrust, on an arms race and on tension, which, as recent history has shown, inherently fail to secure long-term stability for the region.\nThus, cognisant of the fact that mutual confidence fosters cooperation and that the latter in turn augments confidence and indeed security, the following practical arrangements will contribute to devising a viable regional security and cooperation scheme in the Persian Gulf area. As a first and necessary step towards confidence-building, the Persian Gulf States participating in the arrangements will observe the following principles in their bilateral and regional relations respect for one another's sovereignty and territorial integrity; inviolability of their international borders; non-resort to force in the settlement of their disputes; non-interference in one another's internal affairs; and dialogue and mutual understanding.\nSecondly, the cooperation of the countries in the region in social, humanitarian and cultural, economic, industrial, scientific and technical, and political and international fields, as well as coordination in the preservation of the environment and in the energy sector, will undeniably be useful in fostering mutual confidence, which is essential for the success and longevity of any security regime.\nThirdly, any regional mechanism should be developed by the countries in the region without any foreign presence. The Islamic Republic of Iran and the southern littoral States of the Persian Gulf depend on the stability of this strategic waterway for their economic development. Furthermore, they consider the free flow of oil and the stability of world oil markets to be vital to their national interests. However, it should be borne in mind that stability, tranquillity and an atmosphere of mutual confidence are only attainable in the area provided that it is free from the presence and involvement of outside forces. In this regard, we reiterate our objection to the presence of foreign forces in the region.\nSerious endeavours towards the attainment of a regional security and cooperation scheme within the framework referred to have already been made, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has done its utmost to ensure the success of this process. With the help of our regional partners in the Persian Gulf, we have made substantial headway in achieving this common objective. We are confident that the countries in the region are fully capable of ensuring the security of this vital waterway through cooperation among themselves. The recent efforts of the Secretary-General for the implementation of paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) is necessary constructive and commendable steps in the right direction, which will undoubtedly facilitate the establishment of a viable regional security and cooperation system.\nAnother crisis which, for the past 13 years, has been on the agenda of the international community is the question of Afghanistan, which directly affects the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan, the two neighbouring countries that, in addition to bonds of religion, culture and history, have shouldered the heaviest burden by hosting more than five million Afghan refugees. The Islamic Republic of Iran, in pursuit of its principled policy on the Afghan question, has consistently lent its support to the establishment of an Islamic, independent, non-aligned government in Afghanistan, which maintains friendly relations with its neighbours. The achievement of such a government depends upon the unity of all walks of the Afghan Muslim people, and may be guaranteed only through free elections. The recent joint efforts made by the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan and the Afghan mujahideen in the two countries with the objective of seeking a just solution to the Afghan problem, culminating in two joint meetings during the past two months in Islamabad and Tehran, is a major step in the right direction. The United Nations and, in particular, the Secretary-General, drawing upon recent similar experiences, can play a significant role in the formulation and implementation of a just and comprehensive solution in consonance with the wishes of the Afghan people, expressed through free elections. The Islamic Republic of Iran, having welcomed the Secretary-General's five-point statement of 21 May 1991 as a constructive step containing positive elements, is of the view that the statement should receive further elaboration and clarification.\nThe longest regional crisis in the history of the United Nations is also the closest and the most heart-rending to all Muslims. The Palestinian problem has persisted as a chronic malady, owing to the very nature of the international system. While there is increasing hope at the international level for the settlement of regional conflicts in line with the wishes and aspirations of peoples, regrettably, there is no hope in sight for the just and honourable settlement of the Palestinian problem and restoration of the rights of this uprooted people. What is nowadays called a peace plan for the Middle East, far from addressing a just solution to the problem, is geared to bolstering the Israeli position and creating havoc, discord and disarray in the ranks of the other side; what, in this circumstance, has no relevance are the Palestinian people, their immense suffering and their usurped rights. How could the international conference, even if held as proposed, restore the right to self-determination to the Palestinian people under circumstances in which Israel becomes more and more obdurate, the Palestinian populace in the occupied areas faces ever-increasing waves of repression and reprisal, Jewish emigration and the settlement policy in the occupied areas continue unabated and the Zionists continue their occupation of Islamic lands and commit further acts of aggression, particularly against Lebanon. Therefore, in the face of such harsh realities, the Palestinian people are justified in placing all their hopes in their glorious intifadah.\nThe approach of the present international system to the Palestinian question - wrought with double standards - as well as the persistence of Israel in continuing its policies of occupation and ruthless suppression of the Palestinians, leave no doubt that the just and honourable settlement of the Palestinian question can be accomplished in the future world order only through the deepening and strengthening of the ongoing heroic Intifadah, a unified approach on the part of the world community to end the occupation of the Palestinian land and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State in the entire land of Palestine.\nThe current movement towards the establishment of a new order in international relations is taking place in the aftermath of the collapse of an unjust order whose major characteristic was the competition between the two super-Powers over domination of other countries. The utter failure of the experience based on rivalry and domination makes the necessity of precluding their entry in the future order all the more imperative. Should the necessity for a new order be manipulated so as to consolidate the position of a single Power as the dominant pole, it is a foregone conclusion that such an outcome would fail to usher in an atmosphere of confidence, let alone ensure effective international cooperation.\nWe, as Members of the United Nations, once again find ourselves at a crossroads. Our choices today will be crucial in shaping the future world order. The question is, in order to face the many challenges of the new world, which course will we choose: the course of domination and discrimination whose doom is already foretold, or that of justice, peace and cooperation?\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like, on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Namibia, to extend to Ambassador Samir Shihabi our heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I wish him all success, and assure him of my delegation's active cooperation in the execution of his duties. I am confident that, under his able leadership, the work of this Assembly will be handled with competence and efficiency.\nLikewise, I should like to pay a tribute to His Excellency Guido de Marco, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta, for the most exemplary and distinguished manner in which he presided over the forty-fifth session. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, deserves our commendation for his commitment to the work and ideals of the United Nations. We thank him especially for his thought-provoking and comprehensive report. I join in welcoming the new Members of our Organisation, namely: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; the Republic of Korea; the Federated States of Micronesia; the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and the three Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. I assure them of my delegation's readiness to cooperate with them towards strengthening the work of our Organisation in the interest of world peace and inter-State cooperation.\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is meeting at the most historic moment in the life of the United Nations. The change in the world environment and the emerging international cooperation have placed renewed focus on the pivotal role of the United Nations as an instrument for peace-making, peace-building and peace-keeping.\nThe preference for dialogue rather than confrontation augurs well for our common desire for international peace and security. Our ideal for a peaceful world will, however, only be fully realized when the existing arsenals of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction are totally eliminated. We express our fervent hope that the current initiatives will lead to that end, ensuring a secure and peaceful future for generations to come. It is in this context that Namibia has decided to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in accordance with the Organization of African Unity's (OAU) desire to make Africa a nuclear-free zone.\nThe current global changes have created new realities. It is with this in mind that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries reiterated at its tenth Ministerial Conference in Accra, Ghana, not only the validity and importance of its own continued existence, but also the need to defend and uphold its principles and objectives, among which are the sanctity of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the national independence of States.\nAll over the world today, peoples are intensifying their struggle for freedom, democracy and social justice. We welcome the commitment by Governments to give new meaning to democracy and the defence of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nDespite the many victories won so far in the realisation of the principle of self-determination and national independence, of which we can all be justly proud, it is vital that we remind ourselves of the urgent need to bring an end to the remaining vestiges of colonialism, apartheid and oppression in the world.\nThe situation in South Africa is a cause for particular concern to my Government. As Namibians, we have shared the agony, suffering and destruction caused by the system of apartheid in southern Africa. Apartheid, however disguised, is incompatible with peace, stability and genuine cooperation. In this respect, all vestiges of apartheid must be eradicated without delay in order to pave the way for the commencement of serious negotiations, in good faith, for a new constitution, which will usher in a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa. We stand ready to make our humble contribution to that end on the basis of our recent experience in Namibia which we believe can serve as an example in the search for a peaceful solution in South Africa.\nThe spiralling violence in South Africa has claimed many lives and caused untold suffering and wanton destruction in that country. It is thus imperative that the South African Government end this violence, as all indications are that it cannot claim innocence in this tragic situation, particularly in view of its own recent confirmation that it has given secret funds to Inkatha.\nAlthough my Government, like many others, recognises that some positive developments have taken place in South Africa, including in particular the repeal of some of the key pillars of apartheid, these, however, are not sufficient to warrant lessening international pressure for a speedy end to apartheid. The conditions contained in both the Harare Declaration and the United Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, calling for irreversible and profound change in South Africa, have not yet been met.\nWe urge all the key actors in South Africa to take bold and imaginative steps in order to create a favourable climate for negotiations leading to the adoption of a new democratic constitution.\nMy Government reiterates its wholehearted support for international efforts to find peaceful solutions to the remaining conflicts in different parts of the world. In this respect, we particularly welcome the cooperation among the major Powers in all fields, including the military and security fields and the reduction of nuclear weapons.\nConcerning the situation in the People's Republic of Angola, the Government of Namibia reaffirms its full support for the peace process currently under way in that neighbouring country. In this respect, we should like to pay a tribute to both parties and to encourage them to remain firm on the road to the consolidation of peace and the holding of free elections in 1992.\nIn Mozambique, the Government is making genuine efforts to bring about peace and reconciliation in that country. Regrettably, these efforts are being undermined by RENAMO. We urge all those who can exert pressure on RENAMO to do so in order to bring RENAMO to the negotiating table. I wish to welcome the progress made thus far In Western Sahara. We hope the United Nations-supervised referendum will produce genuine results that will enable the Sahraoui people to realise their inalienable rights to self-determination and the achievement of national independence.\nThe question of Palestine continues to be at the centre of the Middle East conflict. The Palestinian people are still denied the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination in their own homeland. They continue to suffer under occupation and oppression.\nThe Government of Namibia reiterates its support for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), aimed at finding a durable solution and lasting peace in the region. It is in this context that we welcome the United States initiative to seek a formula acceptable to all the parties concerned for the convening of such a Conference. We believe that the decisions taken by the Palestine National Council, at its recent Conference in Algiers, will greatly contribute to this end.\nThe Government and people of Namibia have welcomed the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. The end of the Gulf crisis brought relief to the international community. However, the effects of that costly war in human lives and suffering, economic destruction and damage to the environment, will remain with us for a long time to come. The international community is therefore called upon to offer humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the victims of that tragic war.\nThe efforts by the Government of Lebanon to secure control over its borders and to establish peace and national unity, deserve the general support of the international community.\nIn the current favourable international atmosphere, the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a solution to the reunification and territorial integrity of Cyprus, will hopefully be fully realized.\nOn Afghanistan, we hope that the current disposition towards dialogue will allow the Afghan people to find a peaceful solution to the continuing conflict.\nIt is encouraging that the various parties in Cambodia have reached a cease-fire agreement, thus creating conditions conducive to a settlement of the conflict in that country. In this connection, we welcome the establishment of the Supreme National Council as a legitimate interim authority in that country.\nNeedless to say, international cooperation and solidarity are important in our world today, which is increasingly becoming a truly global village. It must be emphasized that this cooperation should be based on mutual respect and benefit among nations. Unfortunately, the present international economic trend shows the perpetuation of a pattern of restrictive economic relations among the industrialized countries to the detriment of the developing countries.\nIn this present unequal relationship, the countries of the South are subjected to unfavourable terms of trade, denied access to technology and financial resources which would help them enhance their economic development and prosperity. Under such circumstances, the developing countries continue to suffer from underdevelopment, poverty, economic stagnation and a devastating debt burden.\nWe call upon the countries of the North to recognize our legitimate desire for an equitable international economic order. At the same time, we accept the challenge for developing countries to stand together in strengthening their economic cooperation and development efforts. This position was recently emphasized by the OAU Summit of Heads of State and Government at Abuja, Nigeria, and the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the Hon-Aligned Countries at Accra, Ghana.\nThe Namibian Government strongly believes that regional economic cooperation will facilitate rapid and sustainable economic growth and development. It is for this reason that, immediately after independence, Namibia joined a number of regional economic institutions - notably, the Southern African Coordination Conference and the African Development Bank. In this spirit, Namibia was one of the first signatories to the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community which was signed by African Heads of State and Government at Abuja, Nigeria, in June 1991. It is the intention of Namibia to formalize membership in the Preferential Trade Area.\nOur continent, the African continent, continues to be afflicted by acute economic problems which perpetuate stagnation, underdevelopment and poverty. In view of the continuing economic crisis in Africa and the regrettable failure of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. 1986-1990 (UHPAAESO) to achieve its stated objectives, the international community, in partnership with Africa, should renew its efforts towards finding a workable mechanism to better assist Africa in its economic recovery and development.\nOne and a half years have passed since Namibia gained independence. The first year was devoted to identifying priority areas for development, namely, agriculture and rural development, education and training, health care and housing. The process of national reconstruction and development upon which we have embarked, is aimed at improving the living conditions of our people who have long been victims of apartheid colonialism and brutal exploitation.\nRecently, an historic Land Reform Conference was held in Windhoek. Important recommendations were adopted and subsequently presented to the Government to provide the basis for forming its land policy.\nIn keeping with our democratic Constitution, we have committed ourselves to ensuring justice for all the Namibian people. Human rights are the cornerstone of our Constitution, the basis of our policy of national reconciliation and the core of our foreign policy.\nAt independence, Namibia inherited social and economic disparities. The majority of our people still live in poverty. This poverty is characterized by low incomes, widespread unemployment and underemployment, high levels of illiteracy, inadequate provision of water, sanitation, health care and education and poor housing. Unfortunately, available statistics on Namibia do not reflect this precarious economic situation, due to the extremely high - even by world standards - income levels of a minority of the population, which is a direct consequence of apartheid. Our current efforts to redress these imbalances are hampered by budgetary constraints and the lack of necessary resources.\nAgainst this background, we continue to appeal to the international community for assistance. We would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to those governments and international organisations, as well as individuals, who have joined hands with us in our development efforts. Furthermore, we welcome the decision taken at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly to give Namibia special consideration in support of its economic and social development. I wish to express the hope that, at this session, a positive decision will be taken on the granting of least developed country status to Namibia.\nAn issue which remains singularly important to my Government is that of Walvis Bay and the off-shore Islands. As is well known, we are negotiating with the South African Government the reintegration of Walvis Bay and the off-short island into the rent of Namibia, as envisaged in Security Council resolution 432 (1978). I would like to inform representatives that, further to the joint statement on the question of Malvis Bay and the offshore islands, issued in Windhoek on 17 May 1991, the Governments of the Republic of Namibia and of the Republic of South Africa have agreed in principle to set up a joint administration, as an interim arrangement, pending an eventual settlement of the aforementioned question. To this end, a decision was taken to establish a Joint Technical Committee to advise the two Governments on the functions of and structures for the joint administration.\nA decision was also taken to appoint a Joint Technical Committee in order to make recommendations on the demarcation of the boundary between the two countries in the middle of the Orange River in accordance with the principles of international law.\nLet me emphasise that, in view of its historic role and responsibility, the Security Council should remain actively seized of the issue of Walvis Bay and the off-shore islands, and we therefore urge the members of the Council, especially the permanent members, to support our efforts towards a final resolution. I also call upon all Member States to ensure that South Africa negotiates in good faith and without undue delay. A successful resolution of this issue will not only consolidate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, but will also create enormous potential for economic integration and prosperity for southern Africa. New opportunities for trade, transport and communication could then be offered and improved not only throughout southern Africa, but also the entire continent and the whole world.\nNamibia is committed to the promotion and maintenance of the ecosystem, essential ecological processes and biological diversity and to the utilization of living natural resources on a sustainable basis. This principle is enshrined in our Constitution. It is in this context that we fully support the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held In Brazil next year.\nWe express our support for the need to restructure and democratise the United Nations system in order to make it more efficient in dealing with the challenges of today. It is, however, our view that such changes should not be confined to the Secretariat, but should be made in all its other principal organs, including the Security Council. We are aware of the various ideas that have so far been advanced on the subject. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make a careful analysis before we take any action.\nFinally, I would like to pay a deserved tribute and extend our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the most distinguished and courageous manner in which he has led the United Nations during his tenure of office. We remember vividly when, in his first address to the United Nations Council for Namibia upon assuming office 10 years ago, he committed himself to work for the independence of Namibia. In keeping with that noble commitment, he worked tirelessly and with zeal for the achievement of that goal, which was finally realized at that momentous midnight hour on 21 March 1990 when he swore in the first President of the Republic of Namibia.\nOnce again, we pay tribute to thousands of United Nations Transition Assistance Group workers who, through their selfless contributions became midwives in the birth of our nation.\nThe good name of the Secretary-General will be inextricably linked to the birth of Namibia. We wish him thanks and many, many happy returns. And, as he knows, he is always welcome to his home - our country, Namibia.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease permit me to extend to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations upon your election as the President of the General Assembly at this session. You have our confidence that your tenure will be marked with great success.\nTo you, Mr. Secretary-General, we wish to express our highest regard and admiration for your outstanding leadership, particularly during the recent crisis in the Middle East, whereby you were able to redefine and strengthen the role of the United Nations as the most appropriate peace-keeping force in the world.\nI should also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, to extend our congratulations and best wishes to the other six nations that have become Members of the United Nations at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nIt is a singular honour for me to speak to address the Assembly today as the representative of a new Member State of the United Nations, the Republic of the Marshall Islands. One week ago my country's flag was raised outside  this noble edifice, joining the flags of the other Member nations. The past week has seen the fulfilment of one of my highest aspirations. I have been received with profound courtesy and consideration, for which my nation and 1 thank all the members warmly. We shall always be grateful. \nWhen one searches for the Marshall Islands on large maps of the world, one may have difficulty finding them, for they are shown as mere specks. Those specks represent 34 atolls and coral islands with an average elevation of just over one metre, situated in the centre of well over a million square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean. The Marshallese people, about 45,000 all told, are descendants of the voyagers who came in canoes across the uncharted sea to find and settle our islands more than 2,000 years ago. In this remote environment with its temperate climate we formed our own nation and developed our own unique culture, which has withstood the test of time. \nAs was the case with so many nations in this Organization, the Marshall Islands experienced significant foreign contact during the nineteenth century, which in some ways forever altered the evolution and direction of our nation. During the past century we have experienced first hand the ravages of war and paid the high price of maintaining peace. We have been ruled by others while learning and developing the framework and institutions of modern democratic government for ourselves. We have maintained our culture and traditions while pursuing our economic development to better the quality of life of our people. In the end, these apparent contradictions have resulted in nothing less than a transformation of the Marshall Islands from an isolated, traditional Pacific island society into a modern nation-State now taking its place in this world Organization that is premised on the principle of sovereign equality for its Members.\nPermit me to pause here for a moment to do something that my advisers tell me is not often done by nations whose sovereignty has been newly restored after a century of colonisation: to praise our last colonial Administrator, which, as it happens, was set up over us by this Organisation. The plain truth of the matter is that we could never have come so far as we have without the aid and encouragement of our former Trustee, now our good friend in a relationship of equality. I refer, of course, to the United States of America.\nI wish to confirm that the Republic of the Marshall Islands binds itself to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. My Government makes a pledge to conduct its affairs as a responsible member of this Organisation. We earnestly and wholeheartedly enlist in the community of those who work to develop planetary loyalty as a complement to national loyalty.\nThe Marshall Islands has watched with great interest the events that have transpired over the past two years, and while we have not been a direct participant in these events we have none the less felt the impact of current world trends. While people may differ as to the long-term meaning of these events, two things seem to be quite clear.\nFirst, as the founding Member States of the United Nations envisaged, there is an essential need for the United Nations to enable the nations of the world to collectively consider and deal with issues of international security. Although there will continue to be disagreement among Member States in this respect, the United Nations has also clearly demonstrated that it has both the potential and the ability to resolve international disputes and to maintain world peace.\nSecondly, in terms of economic and social advancement and development, the United Nations is the only institution that can realistically deal with these issues on a global scale. The tremendous differences between the constituent Members of the United Nations - large and small, wealthy and poor - can be reconciled and coordinated only through the United Nations itself.\nIndeed, it is perhaps this second point on the role of the United Nations that will pose the biggest challenge in the future. Since the Second World War and the founding of the United Nations the primary challenge has been to deal with issues of international disputes, security, politics, problems associated with, and resulting from, the so-called cold war, and decolonisation with the emergence of the new nation States. No doubt, many of these issues will continue to require attention, with the United Nations taking the major role in laying the necessary foundation for the maintenance of world peace and harmony. In the view of the Marshall Islands, the time has come for the United Nations to give greater and broader recognition and attention to the economic and social issues facing the nations of the world.\nWhile issues of international security are inexorably linked to economic and social issues, the quality of life of mankind is, in the end, the most important and fundamental issue facing the nations of the world and this Organisation. Consistent with national agendas and policies, people need the opportunity and the freedom to develop themselves. Their unimpeded efforts will invariably result in the desired progress and development of their respective nations.\nRecognizing and confronting this most important of all tasks is the only way in which the world can have durable and lasting peace. This, we submit, is the biggest challenge facing the United Nations, and it is the fervent hope and desire of the Marshall Islands that the United Nations, through dedication and hard work, will be able to provide the requisite framework whereby mankind can truly improve his condition.\nIt is a difficult challenge, but not insurmountable. However, we must begin to meet it at the individual level. In this respect, I am reminded of a poem by an author who is unknown to me:\n\\\"If there is righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character.\nIf there is beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home.\nIf there is harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation.\nIf there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.\\\"\nOne issue that in fundamental to economic and social progress, as well as to our very existence, is that of the environment.\nThe problem of global warming - the so-called greenhouse effect - is a most formidable one. As I mentioned earlier, the Marshall Islands is a country comprising entirely low-lying coral atolls in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It goes without saying that the consequences of global warming could be totally catastrophic for us as well as for other countries similarly situated. Accordingly, we would make the following observations.\nFirst, scientists throughout the world are not in accord as to the magnitude of the entire problem. Some have predicted considerable atmospheric deterioration, resulting in a significant raising of the sea level within the next several years, while others see the effects of global warming as insignificant for the foreseeable future. This lack of consensus on the subject is most disturbing, and leaves us in a quandary as to what the future may hold.\nSecondly, there is very little, if anything, that one of the smallest and most isolated countries in the world can do to alleviate the problem, other than continue to raise it in the international community.\nThe Marshall Islands is cognizant of the uncertainties in this matter, as well as of the knotty issues to be resolved between the developed and the developing countries. We applaud the recent initiatives of the United Nations on the subject and fully support those initiatives. He are hopeful that through the efforts of the United Nations there will be consensus in respect of the extent of the problem, as well as a sound course of action to remedy, or at least allay, the effects of global warming.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is fully aware of the great importance of providing a sound system of education for its people, and we have committed a great deal of our limited resources to the education of our population. However, we also feel deep concern about the educational level in our schools. We need better schools, but are hard-pressed to develop them through our national resources alone.\nNevertheless, we foresee that better schools, and a better start in life, can be realized in our islands through the globalization of education.\nAs I turn my thoughts homeward, I see a barefoot child sitting on a wooden bench or perhaps on a dirt floor in a one-room school-house on a remote island. This child needs to be equipped with the necessary knowledge to be useful to his nation as well as to the world. In this context, through education there lie many of the answers to many of our problems.\nI think of that child as summed up in an ancient Marshallese expression that is enshrined on our national seal, \\\"Jepllpilln ke elukaan\\\", which conveys to us the idea that a child is a national resource just as is a sprouting coconut tree. Each must be nurtured as it grows. Each generation in turn enriches the soil for those that follow. If children and trees reach their optimum growth they bear fruit that will sustain, replenish and enhance the community, the nation and, ultimately, the world itself.\nI believe that this allegory is salient to the concept of the globalization of education. As world-wide education takes place in the context of sharing and broadening existing knowledge, information and beliefs among the peoples of the world, we will in turn develop the necessary framework for succeeding generations by strengthening individual human development and the quality of life. In addition, we will have greater awareness of our commonalities and differences to better maintain world peace and order without the use of force.\nIn education, we see bright hope in the concept of the global village. Improved communications can make a remote little school a campus of a world-wide university using existing technology to provide interactive long-distance education. Students can ask questions, receive answers and debate issues across continents and oceans. We believe that cooperation within the United Nations will play a dramatic role in bringing this dream to actuality within our lifetime.\nEarlier I referred to economic and social issues as the biggest challenge that the United Nations is facing now and will be facing in years to come. In terms of economic development and trade issues, we note the tremendous differences and disparities which exist among the nations of the world.\nAs a very small developing nation, the Marshall Islands is aware of the recent initiatives and developments on economic and trade issues in the context of our own national development agenda.\nAchieving economic prosperity at both the national and the international level is a difficult task and is an unending challenge for all mankind. Much of the economic progress of the world has been frustrated by political unrest and unreasonable barriers that often derail courses of action and interaction among nations. We are hopeful that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations will be productive and successful.\nLasting peace and security among nations is the most fundamental underpinning for economic progress in the world. In this connection, the United Nations should be accorded much of the credit due in achieving the necessary peace and security to foster a healthier environment for economic advancement.\nSince the Second World War, the nations of the world have advanced with greater experience and knowledge in technologies and economic strategies. Today, we see a greater interdependence among the nations of the world in matters of economic development. As we view it, the emergence of regional economic blocs is indicative of a new trend that has great potential through further international cooperation a trend in which new economic concepts and strategies are applied to achieve greater and sounder economic progress in all regions of the world. He are hopeful that the successful and full participation of all nations in the various regional economic blocs will eventually pave the way for the creation of a new and unified global economic system.\nThe Marshall Islands is taking some steps in economic development, which is essential to itself and which also may be beneficial to other nations. As our economy grows, we hope that our small nation can become a part of this trend in the sense of what we call \\\"the Pacific way\\\": that is, no nation should be left cut.\nFinally, I should like to touch briefly on the subject of current world events in terms of what is often referred to as the emergence of a new world order, particularly from the viewpoint of a very small nation such as the Marshall Islands.\nAs we seek to determine the meaning of recent world events in the context of historical trends, we must start by acknowledging that the world has never been fully at peace. The history of regional and world peace and attempts to bring about such peace is really, in essence, mankind's history of conflict and war. Peace exists when there is an absence of conflict or political, economic and social problems that form the basis for conflict.\nTo the extent that there is a discernible pattern to the history of world conflict it has throughout the centuries mostly been regional or simply man fighting with his immediate neighbours. Mankind lacked the technological ability to engage in a global conflict until this century, in which we have seen the waging of two world wars followed by a cold war that was premised on building and maintaining giant arsenals as a deterrent in order to maintain world peace. How, in the light of current world events we see that the likelihood of another world conflict has been greatly diminished with the United Nations truly taking its place as the premier organisation for the maintenance of world peace. None the less, we are simultaneously witnessing a resurgence of regional and internecine conflict.\nDoes this mean that the world is returning to the past, or does it mean that we are ushering in a new era? I personally would very much like to believe that it is the latter, and that what the world is experiencing at present in terms of conflict represents the last convulsions in the process of attaining true and lasting world peace.\nOver the last few years we have witnessed dramatic events which have fundamentally altered the political, social, economic and physical landscape of the world. These changes present us with the challenge and opportunity to re-examine the laws, institutions and values which have governed the relationships of peoples and nations. It is in this spirit that we offer some thoughts in respect of what is currently referred to as the new world order.\nThe formation of the United Nations some 46 years ago, with its vision of a new era of peace, human rights and international co-operation, brought great hope and promise to the world's peoples. Indeed, the United Nations has helped to usher in an unprecedented degree of international co-operation, mutual respect and understanding among the peoples and nations of the world.\nHowever, at the same time, it has become increasingly evident that the available international machinery and processes need to be greatly strengthened to ensure peace and security in the world and to address newly emerging global issues.\nLong-term solutions to the many issues facing the world will require a new and comprehensive vision of a global society, supported by a new system of values. This recognition does not imply the abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity or the abolition of national autonomy. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a far higher aspiration than has thus far animated human efforts. It clearly requires subordination of national impulses, needs and interests to the imperative claims of a unified, peaceful and prosperous world.\nI wish once again to express heartfelt thanks and gratitude on behalf of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the occasion of our accession to membership in the United Nations. We look forward to working with all of you with the staff of the United Nations and with the specialised agencies.\nIt is an honour to be serving as an active Member of the United Nations, and as a full participant, in striving to meet the goals of the Organisation and the challenges of the future.\nOnce again, Kumol Tata - thank you very much.\n"

The United Nations family has now been enriched by the accession of seven new members: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Korea, South Korea, the Marshall Island?, and Micronesia. To the representatives of these seven States I extend both a warm welcome and a pledge of Canada's continuing cooperation.\nWe meet this year at a time of great opportunity. The pace and direction of events of the past few months have, in general terms, augured well for a more secure and more equitable world order, and for the ultimate triumph of a world dedicated to the rule of law. But progress has presented challenges. One revolution after another has unleashed long-simmering ethnic rivalries. The changes shaking the Soviet Union have exposed the fault-lines of persistent economic and social tensions. Civil strife in Yugoslavia threatens the new peace of Europe. And growing numbers of people flee their countries of origin in the wake of political disruption, natural disasters or relentless poverty.\nThe international community must adapt itself and progress from a world centred on the individual nation State to an interdependent world, from a world dominated by bilateral diplomacy to one in which multilateral institutions occupy a central place.\nOur adaptation at this time of revolutionary change must be both national and international. Canada is now in the process of making this kind of essential adaptation, in the face of domestic challenges. This includes a fundamental questioning of our most basic internal political structures. The Government of Canada is unshakeable in its commitment to a prosperous and united Canada, and I am confident that Canadians will succeed in renewing our own Confederation through the spirit of flexibility, tolerance, compromise and optimism that have always been a feature of Canada's relationship with this Organisation and of our many other international activities.\nWe owe this commitment to our own people and also to a world searching for stability, security and leadership at a time of profound and sometimes wrenching change.\nAdaptation must also come to the body of doctrine and law by which States have conducted their diplomacy for centuries. In Yugoslavia, where the forces of ethnic hatred have visited death and destruction upon hundreds of people, we must not allow the principle of non-intervention to impede an effective international response. The concept of sovereignty is fundamental to statehood, to international discourse and, of course, to the United Nations itself. The current conflict in Yugoslavia is, however, more than an internal affair. A collapse of effective governmental authority in Yugoslavia, if it continues, could escalate the degree of civil strife and endanger peace and security in neighbouring countries. Thus, the concept of sovereignty must respect higher principles, including the need to preserve human life from wanton destruction.\nThat is why Canada has asked the security Council to consider the situation in Yugoslavia. On matters of peace and security, the Council speaks for all of us. Its actions carry the weight and authority of the entire world community. We believe that it can and should add that weight and authority to the efforts of the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to bring about a peaceful, negotiated settlement.\nShould it be decided that a United Nations peace-keeping operation would contribute to such a solution, I want to assure you that Canada is ready and willing to do its part, as we have done numerous times in the past when duty and obligation to the promotion of peace, security and stability are clear.\nEvents within the Organisation over the past year have been ground-breaking. Ordinary Canadians have been active players in these events, and we have participated with commitment and energy as the United Nations has lived up to its Charter mandate. Canadians supported United Nations action in the Persian Gulf. They supported our country's participation in the efforts to restore Kuwaiti sovereignty because they recognised that fundamental international principles were at stake. But they would not have supported these actions without the clear authority of the United Nations Security Council.\nNow, those same Canadians want us to build an even more effective United Nations, one that is able to work for comprehensive security everywhere, based on the international rule of law. The need to build such an overriding security framework is a central lesson of the events of the past year.\nI believe that we must look beyond a system that only inhibits armed confrontations. I believe that we need a new definition of the concept of multilateral security, a definition that takes into account the new and varied threats to global peace and security. These include the depletion of the ozone layer, the degradation of our seas, the debilitating scourge of illicit drugs, world-wide epidemics such as AIDS, mass exoduses of people from one country to another and the desperate poverty that persists in many parts of the world. We also recognize that our collective security depends upon democracy and respect for human rights.\nThe Gulf Crisis showed that the United Nations has the will and the capacity to repel military aggression. But can we meet these many new challenges? Challenges to economic and social development, to human rights and freedoms and to the environment?\nFor Canada, the single most important priority is to make the United Nations stronger, more effective and more relevant to the challenges of this decade. He can begin by taking a fresh look at both the United Nations Charter and the Security Council.\nPew people, for example, realise that seven countries that have joined the United Nations and are serving it with distinction are still identified as \\\"enemy states\\\". He can and should find ways to remove this archaic stigma.\nAs for the Security Council itself, we, like others, are looking for effective leadership from the current five members, which today are working together in the kind of partnership envisaged in the Charter. Canada believes it is not too soon to start looking ahead to the day when key countries, representing all regions of the globe, are permanent members of the Security Council. In the meantime, our immediate priority is to ensure that the Security Council, in its present form, can function with vision, effectiveness and wisdom.\nAs a starting-point, we must strengthen the Council's capacity to take preventive or anticipatory actions. An ability to assess impending flash-points, engage the necessary political will at. the earliest possible stage and take effective, decisive and timely action will increase the lead-time in reacting to events and reduce security risks by minimising the element of surprise. Indeed, the very capacity of the United Nations system to provide early and effective warning may itself discourage recourse to conflict.\nI believe we can accomplish this within the existing Charter as long as the Secretary-General can continue to play a strong leadership role. We can be proud - as can Javier Perez de Cuellar himself - that during his tenure there have been a number of remarkable accomplishments despite enormous constraints. In recognizing his achievements, we acknowledge that his office needs stronger support from us to ensure that his successor can continue to provide the same inspired leadership.\nAt another and very practical level, for the United Nations to be efficient, all Member States must respect their financial obligations. This means paying on time and in full. Given its enhanced role, it is unacceptable in the extreme that the United Nations should be paralysed by a lack of sufficient resources because assessments go unpaid.\nCanada is committed to improving the United Nations ability to channel the military resources of Member States to peaceful purposes. This is essential both for humanitarian purposes and for promoting peace and security through peace-keeping, and through military enforcement when necessary. We look to increasing the capability of the Secretary-General to plan and conduct peace-keeping missions. We should also explore ways of turning these military resources to humanitarian relief purposes.\nWe also need to look more closely at regional security. We are very much aware, all of us, that the Security Council's ability to deter aggressive action cannot by itself provide global security. In addition, we need effective regional security arrangements on a cooperative basis, arrangements that can address some of the underlying causes of insecurity and instability.\nThe new global climate for cooperation has created opportunities for regions to address their own problems without being used as dominoes in some wider ideological game. It has also created obligations for regions to do so. This approach is crucial for long-lasting peace and security in regions such as Central and Eastern Europe and the Asia-Pacific. It has been essential for the progress towards peace in Cambodia and the solution of other regional conflicts. In the Middle East, problems remain, but we believe that solutions to these difficult problems are now a little closer. Canada will continue to support such constructive initiatives as the current efforts of the United States based on the principles enshrined in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We call for direct negotiation between the parties concerned as the only route to a just and lasting peace. We continue to hope that a peace conference can open the door to those negotiations.\nIn the meantime, all countries can make particular efforts in the coming session to demonstrate our sensitivity to the parties directly involved. Within our own purview, a decision by this session of the General Assembly to rescind the infamous \\\"Zionism is racism\\\" resolution would send a powerful and positive signal, and Canada would support a move to do so.\nRenewed efforts to design a comprehensive and effective framework for dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are also absolutely essential. The Gulf conflict showed that conventional arms, as well as weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, can destabilize entire regions. Since 1950, shortly after the Organization was founded, the world has suffered 125 wars. Those wars have killed 25 million people, almost all as a result of conventional, ordinary weapons. How many more conflicts, how many more deaths, how many more destitute refugees does the international community need before we apply the necessary political commitment we all must show to eliminate these threats?\nCanada was among the first nations to call for definitive action. In February our Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, characterized as insane the build-up of weapons that had taken place in Iraq, and we are still seeing that insanity today. At that time, the Prime Minister launched an initiative that called for a number of concrete steps: first, universal adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and its indefinite extension beyond 1995; secondly, immediate conclusion of a global, comprehensive and verifiable convention banning the acquisition, possession and use of chemical weapons; thirdly, strengthening of the biological and toxin weapons convention; and, fourthly, transparency of international arms sales, particularly by the establishment of a United Nations register.\nHe are, with others, moving ahead with proposals to address the areas of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. With respect to conventional weapons, transparency is vital, not only for knowing what is going on in the arms trade but also for building confidence and trust. A global arms-transfer register that is universal, non-discriminatory and effective is long overdue. That register should also include existing national inventories, and we must be prepared to act on the basis of that information.\nWe applaud the historic advances made over the past year in East-West arms control. We urge all parties to ratify and implement the Treaty on conventional forces in Europe and the START Treaty as soon as possible and then to begin anew to reduce unnecessarily large arsenals further.\nLet me point out that in calling for this we are not naive. Every country has a legitimate right to assess its own defence needs and every country has the right to act accordingly. But no country, under guise of defence, has the right to accumulate arms that are intended to destroy its neighbours. Equally troubling are excessive expenditures on arms that sacrifice such other important priorities as health, education and agriculture. The choice is there for all of us to make. The old saying is \\\"They shall beat their swords into ploughshares\\\" - instruments of destruction or tools for peace.\nI should also like to say a few words about the effectiveness of humanitarian relief. Assistance to victims of natural, economic and political disasters has always been a priority of the United Nations. Yet we are well aware that the United Nations response to these crises has lost Its edge, dulled by quarrels among agencies and jealous hoarding of admittedly scant resources. In the face of the human tragedy involved, these practices are inexcusable and intolerable. Hence, it is time for the appointment of a senior official for humanitarian relief and disaster assistance who can organise prompt international responses to disaster with dispatch and compassion.\nRe-invigorating the effectiveness of the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation and cheating stronger links between New York and Geneva can provide inter-agency responses that are needed, coherent and focused responses. We support the establishment of a new United Nations fund to provide flexibility for humanitarian relief at the onset of a disaster.\nWith respect to developing countries, despite the fiscal constraints that are affecting virtually all countries in the world, Canada believes that a strengthened and more effective United Nations must continue its focus on helping the poorest among us.\nDeveloping countries are making major efforts to reform their political and economic systems. Unhappily, in many countries, especially those in Africa, as dramatically confirmed in the Secretary General's report on the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, debt-service obligations continue to exceed by far the rapacity to pay. That challenge has been severely compounded by drought, desertification, environmental degradation and disease, and by the migration of desperate people fleeing these perils.\nWhat are the answers? While they may be complex, they are not new. The common goal of sustainable development depends upon participatory democracy, upon open, market-based economic policies, upon sound economic management and upon an orderly international trading system, which we are trying to ensure in the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations. With ideological blocs now dissolving, we must not invent new economic blocs to divide us once again.\nOver the past year we have seen remarkable progress in the area of human rights - one of Canada's favourite topics. For example, South Africa has taken important steps towards dismantling apartheid and constructing a non-racial democracy. Much, however, as we all know, remains to be done. The 1993 World Conference should become a focal point for enhancing international efforts to promote a universal culture of human rights. As we approach that Conference, we must ask how the United Nations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva can become a more vigorous and more vocal watch-dog for human rights. Given the priority we attach to human rights as one of the three primary objectives of the Charter, we must build the institutional capabilities of the United Nations system so that it can perform its functions effectively. The discrepancy between our goals in the human rights field and the modest means at the disposal of the Secretary-General is becoming increasingly anomalous.\nEvents of recent months have also focused increased and deserved attention on democratic institutions. We all applaud those countries that have held free and fair elections in the past year - many for the first time. But democracy is more than an electoral process; it is a way of thinking, and it must become a part of our being. It requires institutional support, including a free press and the vigilant protection of an independent judiciary. At this session of the General Assembly, we intend to pursue a resolution on the independence of the judiciary.\nThe United Nations must also intensify its work to achieve equality for women. Although the United Nations has taken some important steps to promote gender equality since the proclamation of the International Women's Year and the United Nations Decade for Women, the majority of the world's women still lag far behind men in power, wealth and opportunity, and they still do much of the work.\nBy its own actions and in its own operations, the leadership of the Organization must provide leadership on all issues of women's equality. A long overdue step would be to ensure the improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat by appointing more women to senior positions.\nGreater energy and vigour must be brought to bear in the implementation of forward-looking strategies for the advancement of women, including programmes designed to advance literacy. Efforts to '5 that women participate fully and have a voice in the development, process must be pursued and pushed hard. Beyond considerations of social justice and equity, which is at the foundation of our belief in this issue, it is time that we realized that no nation can be fully developed until all of its citizens are given not only the opportunity but also the ability to contribute their talents, their intelligence and their energy to that goal.\nA key human rights challenge as well is to improve the lives of the world's children. This includes not only full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child but also the ambitious goals of the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit for Children and submitted at last year's session of the General Assembly by Prime Minister Mulroney.\nI want to express Canada's pleasure at the follow-up that is taking place under the aegis of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). As for our own follow-up, we have taken several initiatives in order to increase awareness about children's issues and to encourage cooperation across Canada.\nLet me talk a little bit also about the environment. In just eight months world leaders will gather in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). What a great opportunity to launch a concerted shift to more sustainable forms of development, to integrate environmental concerns into economic development. It is an opportunity to infuse our efforts to protect the international environment with the political will required to do so. It is an opportunity to forge an international consensus that will prevent fracturing our efforts into an unbridgeable divide between developed and underdeveloped countries.\nThe Rio conference is not an optional occasion. It is approaching, and we should recognize now, well in advance of our deliberations, that the price of failure will be high indeed.\nFrom our perspective, a good package at Rio would consist of four elements: the Earth Charter, dealing with principles; Agenda 21, setting out actions; Conventions on Climate Change and Biodiversity; and a Statement of Principles on Forests. For this package to succeed, we will have to ensure that political commitments are made for the necessary resources, the transfer of technology and the adaptation of institutions.\nBut we are worried. Now that three of the four preparatory meetings have been held, the results can be assessed. I fear that we have not overcome the two great risks that UNCED faces: disinterest on the part of the Governments of many developed countries and a slide towards two solitudes of rich and poor.\nIt is true that we in Canada are worried about climate change. He are worried about the loss of species, about pollutants in the Arctic food chain, ocean resources and forests. But we, as a developed country, recognise that for developing countries eliminating poverty, ensuring nutrition and eradicating disease are top priorities and are inextricably linked to the environment. So we recognise that we cannot find solutions to one set of problems without acting on the other.\nEnvironment and development must become a joint preoccupation. He know that developing countries need assistance to implement sustainable development. UNCED, if it does nothing else, must address that issue head on. It must come to grips with the key cross-sectoral issues, namely, human settlements, poverty and sustainability, financial resources, technology transfer, and the international economic environment, including questions of terms of trade and debt.\nAn important distinction between UNCED and other major conferences - and it is a positive one - is the vital role played by the many sectors outside of government which will be participating. Youth, women, indigenous people, business, industry, labour, the world's cities, both environmental and developmental non-governmental organizations, universities, colleges, scientific associations with competence and relevance have been actively participating in the UNCED process. These sectors will be present at UNCED to undertake parallel activities focusing on their contributions to the implementation of sustainable development. They will be writing their own chapters on Agenda 21. And the Conference should be structured to facilitate their special and important contributions.\nThere are simply no viable alternatives to practical, future-oriented results at this Conference. As we begin the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, we must constantly remind ourselves that we are not here to represent blocs, nor to promote ideologies. We are here to represent people. \\\"He the peoples of the United Nations\\\" are the words taken from the Charter. Never have these words meant more or held more promise than today. But words cannot turn famine into bounty, discrimination into equality, repression into freedom, or brutality into compassion. They will mean little if we fail to give ourselves the tools for effective action or if we succumb to the temptation of unilateralism.\nCanada is determined not only to honour those words but also to ensure that the Organisation, which we have long supported in the ideals that it represents, has the means to put them into practice. Canadians want to live on a planet that is peaceful, prosperous and just. We have it here in the Assembly in our power to build such a world. We build it nation by nation, individual by individual, and collectively here together.\nWe are encouraged by recent events and the role that the United Nations has played in those events.\nLet us, as the United Nations, move from strength to strength for all the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nWe are confident that your political skills and deep knowledge of international affairs will enable you to guide successfully our deliberations and lead us to satisfactory results. \nThe trust placed in you by the General Assembly reflects, at the same time, its appreciation for the eminent role played in international relations by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country with which Morocco maintains fraternal and exemplary relations.\nThe delegation of Morocco is happy to assure you and the members of the Bureau of its full support and cooperation in the discharge of your important task.\nI cannot fail to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like at the outset to welcome in our midst the three Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - as well as the two Koreas, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.\nAt the same time, it is my great pleasure to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, my deepest appreciation and gratitude for the tireless efforts he is undertaking in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the United Nations and for his constant endeavours to consolidate the role of the United Nations in favour of international peace and security. I should also like to commend the numerous initiatives he has undertaken since he took office in order to find solutions to international crises and international conflicts.\nDuring the past decade, the Kingdom of Morocco has maintained very close relations with the Secretary-General, exemplified, in particular, by the collaboration of my country with him in order to find a solution to a question of great importance to Morocco.\nOur deliberations take place at a particular juncture, which is the result of an historic change in international relations as a result of the elimination of contradictions between East and West on military and ideological issues and the ushering in of an era of understanding and cooperation in their relations.\nThose changes will undoubtedly leave their imprint on our world for many years to come. This situation stirs our minds in different directions: sometimes, it leads us to optimism while at others it fills us with concern and foreboding, in particular with regard to the role assigned to the developing world in these circumstances: what its future will be; whether it will have a say in the shaping of that future and whether it will have a rightful share of the resources of the world.\nThe liberation of the countries of Eastern Europe from the plight of the old system and their accession to the free world and market economy, the historic events that have radically altered the political life in the Soviet Union, as well as its rapprochement with the Western world - all those developments incline us to optimism and to believe that the peoples of the world are adopting, with regard to their priorities and relationships, new approaches that stem from the will to resolve their real problems instead of pursuing policies that lead only to the accumulation of arms of devastation and mass destruction.\nAs we express our profound satisfaction for the elimination of the underlying reasons of confrontation between East and West and our hope that these developments will reflect positively on the international community and encompass the whole world, we cannot but admit, with deep regret, that this development has not been accompanied, so far, by any improvement in the deplorable conditions of the overwhelming majority of the world's peoples. \nThird world countries continue to flounder under the burden of the debt problems, In fact, the debt-servicing burden prevents them from meeting the basic needs of their peoples - mainly the elimination of poverty, ignorance and disease. It does not allow them either to provide employment, adequate housing or to confront natural disasters and social ills.\nWith regard to the prices of primary commodities, which are the essential, if not the only, source of income of developing countries, those prices are in the throes of a downward trend which aggravates the debt problem of these countries.\nThe continued existence of such a situation is bound to affect international relations as a whole, sooner or later. It is indeed inconceivable to leave more than half the population of the world paralysed and unable to fulfil their role in our civilization. \n It is, therefore, incumbent on the international community to find the appropriate means to take advantage of the current developments and to channel them into a new direction that would be beneficial to all the peoples of the world. This can be done only through a constructive dialogue in which all members of the international community should participate with a view to defining the role our Organization should play in shaping the new world order which, we hope, will be fair and conducive to coexistence and cooperation. In our view, the United Nations is the most appropriate framework for the attainment of such a goal. \nMorocco attaches a special importance to the movement towards unity pursued by the five States of the Maghreb, because we are convinced that the setting up of a solid Maghreb structure - which is an ambition of all the peoples of the region who enjoy close bonds of religion, language and history, as well as a common destiny - has also become today an absolute imperative if we are to mobilize all energies for the development, prosperity and well-being of the Maghreb peoples. It is also an absolute necessity if we are to cope with the challenges of our time and coordinate cooperation with other economic groupings. Thanks to the strong will that inspires our peoples in the redoubling of their efforts to reach the goals enshrined in the Treaty of Marrakesh, which established the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), important results have been achieved by the Fourth Maghreb Summit Conference which was convened in Casablanca on the 15th and the 16th of September 1991. In the course of that summit conference, the Union completed the setting up of its structures. This will no doubt enable us to achieve the aim of complete coordination and fruitful cooperation at all cultural, social and economic levels, as well as in the daily lives of the peoples of the Maghreb. In reaffirmation of the Union's will to establish constructive cooperation with other regional groupings, the summit conference recommended the pursuit of contacts and consultations with the Economic Community of West Africa. Those contacts will allow for coordination between those two groupings which belong to Africa, both the African continent and the South, where there is most urgent need for dialogue between all its countries. It is a well-known fact that Morocco, which has active economic ties with many States of the North, was one of the first countries to call for the initiation of such dialogue. We are convinced that dialogue is the ideal means of unifying the positions of the countries of the South in a manner that would allow them to defend their interests within the framework of the North-South dialogue, which we hope will be constructive and fruitful.\nAs for the steady contact established between AMU, on the one hand, and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Western Mediterranean members, on the other, we have noticed constant progress towards achieving the assigned goal, namely, the laying of sound foundations for development, security and stability in the interests of all countries in that region. It is an established fact that those two groupings are linked by solid ties of history and geography, which manifest themselves in political and economic, as well as in cultural and human fields. It is, however, regrettable that those relations witness some instability from time to time - a situation that requires the emergence of a common political will capable of transcending certain negative outlooks and of imbuing this relationship with a new dynamism that would enable it to live up to the expectations of our peoples and the common principles and ideals we share. This can only be achieved by avoiding futile attitudes and focusing on the practical means whereby we can achieve the level of cooperation that would ensure for both shores of the Western Mediterranean the stability and security we need so that we may engage in a fair and beneficial dialogue. If I have addressed this particular question at length, it is because my country has developed multi-faceted ties with the EEC. However, those close relations have not so far met the requirements of development and the free voluntary exchange of goods and ideas. However, Morocco, just like its other Maghreb partners, remains ready to initiate that dialogue. We are hopeful that the next meeting between the AMU and the EEC to be held in Brussels in November 1991, will lead to results that would give a new impetus to the process and create an appropriate framework for cooperation between the two groupings. We are all aware of the details of the Palestinian problem and of the suffering of the Palestinian people, which has occasionally led to violence and extreme positions. It goes without laying that Morocco supports the just struggle of the Palestinian people in their striving to exercise their inalienable and legitimate right to establish their independent State on their native soil under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, their sole and legitimate representative.\nThough we are now entering upon a new era of international relations, we cannot but underline the tragedy of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories which arises from the persistent Israeli refusal to implement international resolutions and its persistence in its settlement policy with the aim of creating a new demographic situation in those territories, a situation which is in total contradiction with the present international effort aimed at reaching just and lasting peaceful solutions based on international legality.\nMorocco lends its support to the current initiative of convening the Middle East peace conference. We consider this initiative to be the best means of achieving a just and lasting peace in the region and finding a final solution to the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israel conflict. We are all the more optimistic as the President of the United States of America and the President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - co-Chairman of the peace conference on the Middle East - have repeatedly stated that the conference will be based fundamentally on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nMorocco would like to express its full readiness to work for convening the conference under the right conditions to ensure its success in the best interests of all concerned, put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict and, thereby, achieve the happiness and satisfaction of the people of the whole region.\nFinally, I cannot fail to mention the support of my country for the Declaration issued by the Palestine National Council at its most recent meeting last month in Algiers. \nMorocco would like to express its profound satisfaction at the results of the Lebanon peace process which started with the setting up of the High Arab Tripartite Committee in 1989. Those results are: the signing of the Taif Accord, the election of the President of the Republic and the returning of a legitimate government in Lebanon that has gained the recognition of the international community.\nOn this occasion, I would appeal to all nations of the world to continue to provide their assistance to Lebanon, so as to enable that country to implement its programmes of reconstruction, and ask them to contribute to the international fund for the reconstruction of Lebanon.\nMorocco, a member of the Tripartite Committee which has strong ties with the sisterly country of Lebanon, will not fail to exert every effort to enable that country to lead a decent life of freedom through reconciliation and national understanding among all its citizens.\nMorocco has followed with great interest the developments on the African continent during this year. We consider the important steps taken in order to eradicate the system of apartheid in South Africa to be a resounding victory for the principles of justice and equality. This gives us hope that a democratic and multiracial society where all the citizens of that country could coexist without any discrimination can be established.\nOn this occasion, we should like to congratulate the people of South Africa on the political victories achieved recently, at the cost of heavy sacrifices, which enabled them to restore some of their civil rights. We welcome also the courageous measures undertaken by President de Klerk aiming at the eradication of the policies of apartheid from its roots. We encourage him to continue on this path, in collaboration with the African leaders of his country, so that constitutional reforms can be adopted in conformity with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the South African people.\nOn the other hand, the positive development witnessed by the sisterly country of Angola constitute a source of satisfaction. The parties concerned have indeed shown wisdom by the ending of their fratricidal conflicts and the signing of an agreement this year in Portugal the repercussions of which are beneficial to the entire people of Angola.\nI am happy to announce that Morocco is participating in the Second United Nations Angola Verification Mission, with elements of its Royal Armed Forces and Police, because of its great interest in African affairs and its solidarity with the sisterly country of Angola.\nThe agreement concluded by the four Cambodian parties and in particular the establishment of the Supreme National Council, the chairmanship of which was recently assigned to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, as well as the crucial steps undertaken to put an end to their conflict and allow their people to live in peace and security, are in fact very wise decisions. We should like to express our satisfaction and congratulations to all those who have participated in that process.\nWe should like also to express our hope that the Afghan parties will be able to reach a lasting settlement in order to allow the brotherly Afghan people to live a decent life of peace under a government of their choosing.\nMorocco attaches extreme importance to the so-called question of Western Sahara, as it represents for the entire Moroccan people a highly important issue linked to the very destiny of our country and it also has considerable repercussions on the future of our subregion.\nIn this regard, I should like to recall the organic link which exists between that territory and the other parts of Morocco. The social, religious, human and historical ties which mark the relations between Sahara and the other provinces of Morocco, as well as the commitments of allegiance undertaken by the entire Moroccan people towards their Monarch, have blended the whole Moroccan territory in one melting pot. Succeeding centuries have only consolidated those ties. Likewise, the short period of time in which Morocco had to live divided under a very peculiar colonial rule witnessed heroic resistance carried out by the Moroccan people all over its territory in order to defend and preserve its unity by all means.\nWhile colonialism had divided Morocco into different zones - the international zone of Tangier, the French protectorate in the middle part of the country and the Spanish zone in the northern and southern provinces - the liberation of those zones took place gradually, one part after the other, in a peaceful manner, circumstances permitting.\nThe southern zone was liberated starting with the province of Tarfaya in 1958, followed by Sidi Ifni in 1969, until Morocco recovered in 1975 what is called the \\\"Western Sahara\\\", the last part of the southern zone which was under the rule of the same Spanish authority. This recovery of Sahara took place on the basis of an international agreement signed in Madrid on 14 November 1975, of which the General Assembly has taken note and which was registered with the Secretariat of our Organization.\nOne would like to ask the reasons why the question of Western Sahara remained on the agenda after the recovery by Morocco of its Saharan provinces. At this juncture, we do not see any need to go back to the history of this problem now that we are looking at the future with hope. We should like to recall, nevertheless, that Morocco, as an African State, had tried to settle this question within the African framework. However, when we could not achieve that objective, we voluntarily requested the Secretary-General in 1984 to start officially a mission of good offices.\nMr. Peres de Cuellar has, in fact, exerted efforts for which we are thankful and initiated contacts with all parties. The good offices that he has undertaken since April 1966 have resulted in the elaboration of a framework plan approved by the Security Council in April of this year in its resolution 690 (1991). Morocco, which was behind the initiative of the Secretary-General, would like to state its total support for that framework plan.\nThe implementation of all the elements of that plan will undoubtedly require respect for all the time frames set in the successive stages provided for in the plan. Likewise, the translation of its provisions into practical measures will require negotiations that could ensure full implementation of both the letter and spirit of the plan.\nWe are confident that the cooperation and understanding that have always marked the relations between Morocco and the Secretary-General will contribute to the settlement of this question at the beginning of next year.\nIn this regard, we should like to extend to the Secretary-General our most sincere thanks and profound gratitude for the tireless efforts he has undertaken and continues to undertake to reach this goal.\nThe world scene has witnessed, this past year, decisive events that made people talk of a new world order. The present international situation indeed differs completely from the one that prevailed since the Second World War. This will require a new vision for the future of our world.\nIn order to do that, we, at this crucial juncture, should express our ideas frankly and responsibly, and refrain from imposing one-sided concepts. This can be done only in the context of a comprehensive dialogue that would embrace all peoples of the world and take into account their traditions, history and culture.\nWe have no doubt that this dialogue wi11 be fruitful only if it takes into consideration the economic situation of the majority of the countries of the world. It would be inconceivable for a new international order to set aside the problems of development. Security and development are two interrelated elements: the one cannot be achieved without the other.\nWe are optimistic about the possibility of building a world where freedom, security and peace will prevail, a world that tackles all problems in an atmosphere of solidarity and interdependence. We are convinced that this session of the General Assembly will provide a useful opportunity for exchanging views and identifying the ways and means that can lead us to the attainment of this noble objective.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I should like to tell you how very pleased I am to see the representative of a country linked to mine by traditional ties of friendship and cooperation responsible for directing the work of the General Assembly. Your personal qualities and acknowledged experience will contribute to ensuring that this session will conclude with successful results.\nI also wish to underscore the skill and competence of your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Justice of Malta, and, in all fairness, to express the respect inspired in me by the admirable work performed at the head of the Organisation by its very distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has made so many and such varied efforts on behalf of peace in complicated and difficult circumstances.\nI should like also to extend my warmest welcome to the seven new Members which have just joined the United Nations: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - whose newly-recovered independence has given us cause for rejoicing - as well as the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nOnce again it has been the wish of the Spanish Government that the King, by virtue of the functions conferred upon him under the Constitution, should address this universal gathering. He does so on behalf of a country which was one of the first in history to decide to become a nation-State, and which as such has been contributing since the dawn of the modern age to the birth and normative development of international society. Thus, as a constitutional monarch, I represent an ancient nation and also a young people which, for this reason and also because it has recovered democracy and freedom, faces the future with hope and enthusiasm.\nIt was also with hope that the founders of the United Rations conceived of it as a centre for harmonizing the efforts of the world's people to attain international peace and security, as an institution designed to foster cooperation among nations for the solution of their economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems and also as an Organization devoted to reaffirming faith in the rights of man and the dignity of the human being by eliminating discrimination based on race or sex, belief or ideas.\nSince the San Francisco Conference, the world has undergone profound transformations and has been subject to considerable change. Nevertheless, our peoples aspire - today more than ever - to ordering their coexistence both within and outside their borders in accordance with the same ideals of peace, justice and liberty that constitute the fundamental triad upon which this Organization has been based ever since it was founded almost half a century ago. The best guarantee for a future of hope for all mankind lies in the realization of these ideals. It is necessary to emphasise the many achievements of the Organization on the long and difficult path leading to the universal realisation of this threefold ideal, which la enunciated in the Preamble to its founding Charter. \nThe United Nations has contributed, in an outstanding way, to avoiding confrontation among States, to preventing the outbreak of aimed conflicts, or to limiting their effects on civilian populations. It has also demonstrated recently that the international community is capable of reacting effectively and jointly for the purpose of racing up to aggression. And it continues to carry out a commendable effort of peacemaking in different regions of the world, whether by keeping the peace in situations of potential conflict or by promoting peace where it must be re-established. \nThe United Nations has been first of all the spur, and then the powerful driving force, in the process of decolonisation which, in the short span of a few decades, has radically transformed the structure and the very composition of international society. Society has been enriched by the accession to it of many peoples and countries which formerly were colonised and which today are represented here in their capacity of sovereign and independent States.\nNevertheless, colonialism has not yet disappeared from the world, and for this reason this General Assembly has proclaimed the 10 years from 1990 to the year 2000 as the International Decade for its elimination. I trust that this noble aspiration may soon be realized, thereby eliminating once and for all any vestiges of anachronistic situations incompatible with the current world order.\nIn this connection, I cannot refrain from mentioning a colonial problem which has not yet been resolved and which affects the territorial integrity of Spain. Moreover, as members are aware, it is an issue especially sensitive for all Spaniards. It is the issue of Gibraltar, and today I wish to reiterate my hope that the Hispano-British negotiating process now under way will be effective in achieving a solution compatible with the times in which we live.\nThe activity of the United Nations system has been enormous in the sphere of economic and social development, establishing guidelines and criteria, endowing funds and programmes and designing structures for cooperation which have benefited hundreds of millions of people on every continent.\nThe United Nations has also inaugurated a new era in the history of international relations by introducing a whole set of mechanisms and instruments aimed at promoting respect for human rights. In so doing, it has effectively delimited the scope of one of the principles on which international society is based. Now it is no longer possible in our day to maintain that action defending human rights and exercised within the framework of the Charter constitutes Interference in the Internal affair* of a State. This is certainly a decisive advance on the path to the protection of human dignity from the abuse and outrages that may be committed against it through the arbitrary exercise of public powers or of any other centre of power within a society.\nIt is precisely the success that Member Status have achieved In the implementation of such noble aspirations that moves me to express the deep respect that this Organisation inspires in me as well as my respect for the work and efforts which the representatives of the respective Governments devote dally to the cause of peace in the world, to human freedom, and to justice for all peoples.\nThe peaceful solution of disputes, respect for human rights and the fostering of the economic and social development of peoples constitute the basic pillars sustaining peace. If one of them were to be removed, the entire edifice would crumble. Hence, the international order which all of us together must build.\nIn this endeavour Spain is sparing no effort to collaborate with the United Nations. Thus, and in response to the Secretary General's appeals, Spain has taken part in the commendable activity of the peace-keeping forces, first, in Namibia and Angola, and then In Central America. We are very pleased that Spaniards - both civilians and military - are. with them, actively contributing with colleagues from many other countries to the promotion of peace and coexistence in different parts of the world.\nIn recent years, Spain has also considerably raised its contribution to the Organization's voluntary funds and programmes, ranging from those whose purpose is the promotion of development to those devoted to the social groups most in need of attention, such as children, refugees or populations affected by natural disasters. This commitment; is due to the higher level of development attained by Spain in recent times. We undertake it with total conviction and the Spanish Government intends to work resolutely towards this goal.\nThe end of the cold war has opened up very hopeful prospects for mankind though the world is not yet free of tensions and risks. We have recently witnessed spectacular changes, which, we hope, have irreversibly ushered in a new climate of detente and cooperation, where confrontation and mistrust, formerly reigned. The transformations now under way in the Soviet Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the vigorous revival of democratic ideals and practices in Latin America, and the progressive dismantling of the system of apartheid in South Africa, as well as democratic trends on the African continent, have led to the emergence on a universal scale of a rejuvenated flow of hopeful expectations. But these expectations, which at times are conflicting, are putting to the test, not only the structures and the chances for transformation of many countries, but also the capacity of the international community to respond to the yearnings for democracy and progress of largo groups of peoples who have recovered their faith in themselves. We cannot forget that, just as freedom is an essential condition for peaceful coexistence, the latter must also be based on justice and on the prosperity of peoples - of all peoples who rightfully demand adequate economic and social development.\nFor all these reasons, although the United Nations has played a major role in the changing world over the past few years, its role in the new world now being reshaped will be even greater. In this new world, the ending of the confrontation between East and West places more in evidence another division which is no less dramatic - the North-South division. It is a world in which the differences between developed and developing countries not only continue to exist, but are becoming even greater.\nThis imbalance has been particularly disquieting during the past decade in Latin America and in Africa, continents in which the rate of growth of resources has been lower than that of the population. The correcting of this trend constitutes a challenge which we must face not only because it is an imperative of justice, but also on behalf of peace and security for all. In our international community, which is closely interdependent, economic deterioration in any part of the world generates negative consequences for the other parts. A coordinated effort by the industrialized countries, in conjunction with the developing countries, is needed in order to stimulate harmonious growth that assures a decent standard of living for the vast sectors of mankind, who today live in poverty, or who are struggling to overcome stagnation or backwardness. \nNow we are all much more aware that economic development is scarcely possible if the rules of a market economy that allow for private initiative are not respected. Despite its imperfections, the market constitutes an irreplaceable guide for economic activity and is indispensable for a rational allocation of resources. But, at the same time, it will always be necessary, in the general interest, to complement it with appropriate correctives in order to meet the needs of the least favoured sectors or groups.\nSocieties cannot advance if they do not pay proper attention to the development of their human resources. It is important to raise the hopes and living conditions of the population and their level of literacy, improve nutrition and reduce the rate of infant mortality. These are important social indices because it is the human being and not the State which is ultimately in possession of the right to development. \nIt will be difficult to achieve these objectives if national societies do not organize themselves on the basis of respect for certain principles, among which must be mentioned the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and the safeguarding of human rights. These goals cannot be attained if society does not endow itself with political systems that allow for the participation of the people and the free election of their leaders. One of the great achievements of civilisation has precisely been the designing of political structures capable of reconciling the essential equality of all people with the diversity of thought and interests that provide their driving force. \nfrom this perspective it is encouraging to note the emergence of a consensus within the United Nations on these issues. At the same time we are convinced that the easing of international tension and the end of the cold war will provide many opportunities for slowing down the arms race and making further progress in disarmament agreements, as shown by the recent United States initiatives and proposals which have been welcomed so favourably. These are opportunities which must be seized so that we can devote a large part of the resources released to fostering economic growth and social progress the world over. \nI shall add another consideration which is perhaps the most important. There can be no sustained economic development if we do not respect the environment, which provides us with natural resources and is the framework that sustains human life on the planet which we share as our common home.\nWe must combine our efforts today more than ever before, in order to eliminate the sources of pollution from the atmosphere and the air which we breathe; in order to confront the dangers which threaten our oceans, seas and rivers; and in order to ensure the survival of the woods and the biological diversity of plants and animal species. This is the greatest challenge now facing the international community. The settlement of these problems must be a priority goal for all Governments, which must set their sights on future generations. They have the right to inherit a living planet, and it is our obligation to bequeath it to them. The United Nations also took pioneering action in this area for the first time barely two decades ago, by including environmental issues on the list of matters of global interest.\nThe United Nations continues to keep aflame the torch that was lit in Stockholm. Once more the United Nations has taken the immensely important decision to convene a Conference on Environment and Development next year. The initiative is just as timely as is appropriate the decision to place environmental protection within a context of interdependence for the purpose of sustained growth and development for all countries. It requires nations with wealthy economies to devote supplementary financial resources to the developing countries and to be willing to transfer to them the technologies needed to protect the environment.\nAction by Governments on a national and international scale is necessary but not sufficient. Concerted efforts on the part of companies, the media, the scientific community and non-governmental organizations are needed in order to meet this global challenge. Much has been done, but much more remains tot us to do. When preparing for the Conference, I am certain that members will be very conscious of the fact that conservation and the improvement of the environment are the means to the survival of mankind. And at this point allow me to indicate - as did the Secretary-General last year - that just as the Organisation's Charter is the basic instrument governing relations between States, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that which regulates relations between the State and the individual, the time has come to think about drawing up an instrument that regulates the relations between mankind and nature. \nWe are on the threshold of a year of special importance and relevance for my country, and also for Europe, for America and for the whole world. The full integration of Spain into the European Community will culminate in 1992, at the same time as the Community completes its single market and takes new and decisive steps towards political, economic and monetary union. It is our fervent desire and also a very firm commitment on our part that this process be directed to promoting stability and progress in continental Europe as a whole, and also that it will be accompanied by the continuous opening up of Europe to the rest of the world, as befits its historic essence and its most genuine interests.\nIn 1992 - five centuries after the initial meeting between the old and the new worlds - we Spaniards will take on the important responsibility of hosting events as important as the Seville World Fair, the Barcelona Olympic Games and the Second Ibero-American Conference, which will be the continuation of the one held this year in Mexico. With all this, we hope that Spain in 1992 will be a meeting-place for men and women from all over the world, a crossroads for scientific and cultural contributions and spoiling successes, and a setting for reflection and plans for our common future. Far from being a mere simplistic exercise in exaltation, we would like the universal spirit with, which the United Nations is infused to preside also over the activities that will take place in our country in 19S2 and to which all members and their respective countries are cordially invited.\nI wanted to share some thoughts with you on the major issues now facing the international community as a whole. Mankind's very survival and the shape of its future depend on the way that they are approached and resolved. The international community is equipped with the most appropriate instrument for meeting this important challenge; the United Nations. For this reason I wished today to reaffirm my confidence in the Organization and in its ability to attain increasingly greater heights of peace, justice and freedom for all peoples. Lastly, I should like to reiterate the fervent wish of the Spanish Government and people, to participate in and contribute more actively to the endeavours of the United Nations on the basis of the experience of our past, our present energy and our hope for the future. Please rest assured that in this lofty undertaking the United Nations may count upon the solidarity and support of Spain and its King.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, I should like to congratulate warmly Ambassador Shihabi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. His election did not occur by mere chance. It reflects recognition of his outstanding qualities and is a mark of the respect in which his sister country, Saudi Arabic, is held in the international arena. I am sure that with his experience and abilities, the work of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly will be guided efficiently and ably. I should like to assure him of our full cooperation in his Important and difficult mission.\nI should like to express once again the appreciation of our delegation to his predecessor, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco, for the most able manner in which he presided over the work of the last session.\nWe should also like to draw attention to the continuing work for peace of the Secretary-General of our Organization, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. We once again assure him of our full cooperation and commend him most warmly. We also welcome the delegation of Cambodia, led by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We trust that the process of reconciliation and dialogue which has been begun will soon, under his leadership, result in peace in that country which we hold so dear.\nAdmission to the United Nations of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is indeed an important event end we trust that this will encourage those two friendly States to pursue their dialogue with a view to achieving the unification of the country.\nThe presence here among us today of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania indeed demonstrates that they have regained their sovereignty and we extend to them a warm welcome. We also welcome the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. This will no doubt enhance the universality of our Organisation as almost all the inhabitants of the world now adhere to its principles and work in line with its objectives.\nMany events have taken place in the world since our last session. Some of those events are cause for hope, while others are signs of danger. Peoples' aspiration after freedom and democracy became stronger while ideological antagonisms receded. However, the Gulf crisis and the persistence of many hotbeds of tension and events now under way in Eastern Europe show the limits of the changes and the problems that they can generate.\nWe do of course welcome greater cooperation between the major Powers, the progress of democracy and the disappearance of ideological barriers. But all these achievements, regardless of their importance, cannot bear fruit outside some framework of justice that disregards particularistic approaches and vested interests.\nIn the Middle East, the oppressed people of Palestine still suffer under the yoke of occupation. A solution must be found to the problem. But one cannot conceive of any solution without the participation of the Palestinian people whose representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), or without full respect for their inalienable right to establish their own State in the land of Palestine.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania supports the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East and welcomes the initiatives that are being taken in this respect.\nIn the Gulf region, the crisis has caused enormous human and material destruction. The war has left the entire region devastated. While we share the joy of the people of Kuwait, who have regained sovereignty over their territory, we cannot ignore the tragedy of the people of Iraq who are deprived of food and medicine, regardless of the recommendations of missions sent by the United Nations.\nIn Western Sahara, current developments augur well for an imminent end to the fratricidal conflict there. The cease-fire agreement of 6 September 1991 and the setting up of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) side by side with the goodwill of the parties concerned, should lead to peace in the subregion - peace that will certainly make a significant contribution to the building of the greater Maghreb. We, for our part, will spare no effort in supporting the peace process that has been initiated by the United Nations. The United Nations may rest assured of our full support.\nIn South Africa, we follow with great interest the development of the situation and hope that this augurs well for the future of the region.\nIn Angola, we welcome the peace agreement which was signed on 31 May 199 3 between the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. He welcome the spirit of constructive cooperation which led to the agreement and hope to see the sons of Angola tackling together the difficult task of reconstruction and development in their country.\nIn Liberia, as a result of African wisdom, a return to calm has begun. The efforts of the Community of West African States have encouraged the brothers who were divided to sit down together at the negotiating table. We hope that that spirit of fraternity and concord will soon be translated into a permanent peace and a return to normality in the country.\nWe, for our part, have begun discussions with our brothers in Senegal so as to move ahead from the serious events which disrupted the region in 1989 and which led to so much human suffering. We hope to open a new chapter in our relations where tension and suspicion will yield to a serene relationship based on history, geography and human ties.\nIn Asia and in Latin America, the will and the resolve of governments have made possible the resolution of numerous conflicts. Last July the first Ibero-American Summit held in Guadalajara, with the participation of Spain, Portugal and Latin American countries, provided a new framework for concerted action and cooperating, and we hope that this new forum will help to strengthen peace in the world.\nIn Afghanistan, we continue to follow the developments of the situation. We regret that, despite the agreement signed three years ago, and the withdrawal of foreign troops, peace has not yet returned to the people of Afghanistan.\nIn Cyprus, hopes raised through the mediation of the Secretary-General are slow to take the form of a final and lasting peace agreement. We invite the parties to the conflict to continue a constructive dialogue with a view to finding a solution to the problem that would bring security and social justice to all the component parts of the Cypriot people.\nToday, while we have grounds for welcoming some positive tendencies towards the resolution of political problems, we still feel greatly concerned over the worsening economic and social situation of more than two thirds of the human race. That already difficult situation has been aggravated by the consequences of the Gulf war which consumed or diverted considerable resources which were intended for development aid.\nThe increasing number of international forums where development problems are discussed has not improved the situation. Rather, it has brought about more frustration and disappointment. Bilateral aid continues to fall and it is increasingly tied to the acceptance of concepts and models offered by the donors with the resulting danger of simply neglecting the cultural and socio-economic features and traits of the recipients. The international financing institutions are increasingly adding to the constraints that they impose and also the area in which they have to operate has become larger with the changes in Eastern Europe. Yet there has been no increase in the resources available to them. However, despite all this, we are optimistic and hope that the developing countries will see their demands acceded to in respect of debt relief, fair prices for commodities, free access to the markets of the industrialized countries and an increase in development aid.\nAfrica, more than any other continent, is in the grip of an unprecedented economic crisis, at a time when social and political changes are freeing the energies of its peoples and creating conditions that are more favourable for development. Unless our economies are revived, we may only expect serious human plights such as hunger, internal disruption and inter-State disputes. At the continental level, awareness of the situation was reflected at the summit meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Abuja, when it adopted the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community, for the economic integration of the continent.\nThe economic situation of the developing countries, particularly of African countries, makes it essential to seek solutions that would enable our countries to provide internal resources and to have new means made available to them for the desired economic takeoff. If nothing is done in that direction, structural adjustment programmes and measures will simply worsen the situation of the poorest nations without giving them any assurance of a better future.\nThe industrialized countries have shown that they can mobilize their resources at will. They did that when they wanted to encourage change in Eastern Europe and when they wanted to deal with the Gulf crisis. Improvement in the international climate and arms limitation have made it possible to make more resources available for peaceful development. In this connection, we welcome President Bush's initiative to give a new impetus to general disarmament. We hope the rich countries will adopt an effective policy that aims at supporting development with a view to creating a better world and achieving fairer distribution of the world's wealth. It this is not done, the fears expressed in 1990 by the Secretary-General will indeed come true. We warned that progress at the political level may prove illusory if we cannot respond to the aspirations for prosperity for the overwhelming majority of the world's population.\nThe continuing degradation of the environment is a source of concern for the human race as a whole. It requires concerted action by all countries, based on their abilities and their respective responsibilities. Environmental protection must be seen as an integral part of development efforts. My country, which has been affected by desertification and the adverse consequences of that phenomenon, attaches the greatest importance to environmental issues. We welcome the convening next June of the conference in Rio de Janeiro, which will deal with this issue.\nMy country, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, suffers from the impact of the world crisis, which has been aggravated by such natural disasters as drought, desertification and locusts. Despite these difficulties, our people, under the leadership of our President. Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya, are standing firm, and we are constantly working towards achievements, which have been recognized by our development partners.\nWhile we do indeed deplore the world economic situation, we also welcome the progress made in many countries in the areas of democracy and freedom. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania, true to the commitments of its Political Directorate, has furthered the democratic process launched in 1986 with the establishment of the municipalities. A new Constitution was adopted by referendum, and new laws are being promulgated on political associations freedom of the press. These developments lead to the creation of the best possible conditions for the full exercise of political rights by all citizens without distinction.\nWe have promulgated laws granting amnesty for all political Crimes and offences or offences relating to domestic or external State security issues, over the period from 1960 to the present. We have thus tried to encourage everyone to participate in national construction. The next stage will involve the organisation of free, multi-party presidential and legislative elections.\nIn addition to this progress achieved on the path to democracy, we are pursuing our struggle against illiteracy, which we hope to eradicate completely by the year 2000.\nEmancipation of women and child care are other important aspects of our national policy. Many measures have been taken in this area, and they have been hailed by all the organisations involved in these issues.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to all those countries, institutions, government bodies and non-governmental organizations that have helped us and that continue to help us within the context of the efforts we are making to ensure the economic and social prosperity of our people.\nMankind is at a historic turning-point. A new world order is emerging. This new world must be freed from the current economic imbalances, ensure that there is justice for all peoples without distinction as to ethnic origin or religion, promote human rights, not selectively, but rather universally, and be based on a genuine consensus, which applies the same rules to everyone.\nThe United Nations, which embodies the unanimous will of all countries, has a paramount role to play in the current crucial phase. It must give direction to collective action and ensure that the will of the majority prevails over the will of a few States, no matter how powerful they may be. \nPeace, democracy and development are the goals that the United Nations set for itself in 1945. However, movement towards these goals has been hampered by the conflicts of the most powerful and the egoism of the richest. Let us ensure that we achieve these goals. If we do so, we will then have established a fair and equitable world order that can elicit the enthusiastic support of everyone. For its part, Mauritania, guided by our unwavering faith in the ideals of the Organisation, will endeavour always to improve, strengthen and enhance the role of the United nations as it works towards the achievement of its purposes and objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am happy to greet you on behalf of the Haitian people, whose hearts beat in time with liberty, pride and dignity: the liberty we have conquered, the pride we have rediscovered and the dignity we have restored. From a distance may be glimpsed the smiles of a people happy to greet you in the manner of \\\"lavalas\\\". From a distance may be heard the voice of the Haitian nation happy to be part of the United Nations, happy to be present at the United Nations.\nAs the echo of this multitude of Haitian voices resounds, I wish to extend to Mr. Shihabi my warmest congratulation on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. His exceptional qualities and his vast experience in dealing with international problems have undoubtedly rekindled hope.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Guido De Marco, who conducted the proceedings of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session so wisely and with such competence.\nI want also to pay a warn tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his courage and patience. His mandate, unfortunately, will expire in the next few months. Without the slightest doubt, he has, with skill and farsightedness, put into effect the prescriptions laid down for the international community in the Charter of the United Nations. To a very large extent, the United Nations is in his debt for the restoration of confidence that it is enjoying today. We shall long remember this representative of Latin American diplomacy.\nTo my dear Latin American friends and companions I extend a fraternal greeting. As you know, we share the experience of struggle - struggle against the enslavement of man by man, struggle for the advent of an era of peace and the total liberation of the Latin American continent and the whole world.\nWith our comrades, friends, brothers and sisters we were united yesterday, and we are still united, for certainly, with democracy, victory will be ours. Together, we shall prevail.\nThe vibration of these linguistic chorda encourages me to add just a few notes to this symphony of languages. I am sure that Anglophones are delighted to hear a Haitian voice saying hello. Here we are on the way to democracy, fighting against all kinds of injustice and exploitation. The world, of course, will be better. Let's go. Up with the poor. Up with Haiti and Haitians living in the United States of America, building solidarity for the kingdom of justice, respect and dignity. To arrive at this stage of life in the history of Haiti, friends and organisations within the international community provide great solidarity to the Haitian people. For that solidarity, we express our gratitude to all. For the solidarity, we shall remain grateful to the Organisation that helped, and continues to help, Haitian people. For decades, Haitians have been refugees around the world. To the countries that have received us we say, \\\"Thanks\\\". To the countries that have mistreated us we say, \\\"Look, brothers, we are Haitians, and we are proud to be Haitians. He love Haiti, and we are proud to love Haiti. We are citizens of the world, and we are proud to be citizens of the world.\\\" To those who have received us with respect and dignity we say once again, \\\"Thanks\\\". \nMany of our African and Arab brothers, of course, speak English. But this does not mean that we cannot have recourse to the lingala language to greet all Africans. I greet all Africans. Solidarity between Africa and Haiti. Let us renew the links with Africa and return to our roots of solidarity, hand in hand. I love Africa and invite Africans to come to Haiti. I love Africa. I wish also to have recourse to Arabic to speak to our Arab sisters and brothers. \nHow are you doing? I am very happy. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Peace be among you. For peace in the Middle East my heart opens to the Jews with these words of peace: Peace be with you. Blessed be God. I lived for three years in Israel and learned your language, and today I am happy to say to you on behalf of my people, \\\"Peace to all of you\\\". We now have the opportunity, together, to do many good things. However, we do not have the time today to mention them all. The time will come. Blessed be God. How can we turn our eyes towards Germany and Italy without saying: Good afternoon. How are you? Together we are strong. We have many things to do, and of course we shall travel towards democracy.\nAlready I hear the voice of eloquent silence asking me \\\"What about Italy?\\\"\nLet there sound an Italian note. Here it is - better late than never. It would have been difficult for me to forget my friends, especially when I think that at this very time many of them are working for peace. We have said over and over again to everyone, and today we way again, that to speak of peace is to speak of the people. That is why we are happy to be among you. Let representatives guess which language is now going to make its entry into the United nations. Yes, it is Creole of course. Yes, we are on our way, together with all peoples of all the United Nations, towards a better tomorrow.\nIndeed, this decade has begun with events that can shape the future of mankind and of course give rise to hopes and questions. The forty-sixth session of the General Assembly crystallises, in our view, a period of profound reflection for the international community. Unlike previous periods, this session is taking place at a time when profound upheavals are appreciably changing the geopolitical axes of our planet. The dialectic of a bipolar policy is prompting the international community to wonder who is to accede to the seat of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations? What about democracy at the global level?\nWe are talking about the future of the geopolitical axes, which should never be allowed to develop into totalitarian and absolute power. At a time when the international community is concerned with changes in the geopolitical axes of the planet, let us turn to our dear Haiti, the rebellious, faithful daughter, a rebel against all imperialist dictates but faithful to all democratic prescriptions.\nI should like to speak of ten milestones that line our way; we could call them the ten democratic commandments that arise from our democratic praxis. Our message will be confined to the democratic arena, where the ten democratic commands stand up in a straight line. The first milestone, or the first democratic commandment, is liberty or death. As you know, Haiti was one of the first beacons of liberty in the Western Hemisphere. In 1791, we gave the world its first slave revolution, which enabled hundreds of thousands of blacks to throw off the yoke of repression. The leaders of this victorious revolution helped to finance the liberation crusade of Simon Bolivar in South America. It was in Haiti chat slavery was first abolished, taking a giant stride towards human freedom. From the Haitian revolution grew the roots of the declaration of human rights. The Haiti of Boukmann, Dessalines and Toussaint Louverture was and remains the first black republic in the world.\nLike a star of liberty, Haiti shines in the eyes of all. Throughout our history, often glorious, sometimes troubled, we have always recalled with pride the unprecedented exploits of our ancestors The cries of liberty or death, liberty or death, far from being stifled in a sterile past, ring out continually in the heart of a people that has become, forever, a free nation.\nAll throughout our march towards 1991, in spite of our contribution to the free world, Haiti has not been able to open all the doors of the international community. The colonists of those days and their allies were afraid of freedom, as were our leaders and the traditional oligarchy. White colonists, black colonists - we had to throw off the yoke of black dictators and their international allies.\nHappily, in 1986, to the surprise of the entire world, the Haitian people overthrew a dictatorial regime of 30 years' standing. This was the beginning of the end of a dictatorship which has left indelible scars. But the more we recall these scars, the louder we cry; liberty or death, liberty or death.\nThe second milestone, or democratic commandment, is democracy or death. After having thrown out the repressive, corrupt regime of the Duvaliers on 7 February 1986, the people of Charlemagne Peralte had only one choice: to establish, once and for all, a democratic regime in Haiti. Hence, liberty or death is equivalent to democracy or death. We therefore struggled relentlessly for the attainment of our rights against minority groups that held a monopoly on power after 1986. A relentless struggle and a legitimate one, since those in power did nothing to change the nature of the State, which for such a long time created conditions for maintaining the status quo and the functioning of the machinery of exploitation and repression.\nFinally, on 16 December 1990, thanks to the valour of the Haitian people and thanks to your contribution, for the first time we held free, fair and democratic elections. Honour to the Haitian masses. Glory to our ancestors, who thwarted colonialism at the beginning of the 19th century. Hail to the international community and hail to the United Nations!\nThis is indeed an important first in history. For once, for the first time, a people with an ingenious tactical movement brought about a revolution by the ballot box. The election of the President of the Republic by a majority of more than 70 per cent on the first ballot symbolises the victory of the people, the power of the people and the demands of the people. These free, fair and democratic elections are ultimately the result of our own political strategy, that is to say, the historic upsurge of \\\"lavalas\\\". We fought in the manner of \\\"lavalas\\\", we won in the manner of \\\"lavalas\\\" and we are advancing in the manner of \\\"lavalas\\\".\nIn union there is strength, this is our motto. With the fork of division one cannot drink the soup of elections; with the fork of division, one cannot drink the soup of democracy. In a way, the \\\"lavalas\\\" strategy is akin to the thoughts of the Pope, who, in his \\\"Centesimus Annus\\\" encyclical, suggested that events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were paving the way for the reaffirmation of the \\\"positive character of an authentic theology of the total liberation of Ban\\\". In Haiti, this theological approach cannot be confined to a simple analysis of reality; it is meant to be, rather, a method of thought and action in the school of the poor, a privileged elite of the revelation of God, the historical subject of this struggle for the total liberation of man.\nIt is on the basis of the experience of the poor that we base the teachings of the democratic praxis, fuelled and illuminated, o\u00a3 course, by the theology of freedom. The dialectic to be established between the theology of freedom and the politics of freedom necessarily phases through the life and experiences of the poor.\nWhen Jean-Paul Sartre criticised Hegel he noted that the latter had overlooked the fact that a void is devoid of something, and that liberation theologians can state that the void of poverty is an avid void, and not devoid of what is essential. Avid of liberation. Its void entails a legitimate expectation whose essence dwells within the spirit of the poor. It lives by giving life to democracy. We, who are elected democratically, must be faithful to its rights.\nI turn now to the third milestone of democracy: fidelity to human rights. If a man has duties, he certainly also has rights, rights to be respected and rights to respect, rights to guarantee that ultimately a State ruled by law will emerge.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is and must remain sacred. It is our heavy responsibility to observe the Constitution faithfully to guarantee our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, in keeping with our Act of Independence of 1804 and the- 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThere must be respect for the Constitution, in order to build a socially just, economically free and politically independent Haitian nation.\nThere must be respect for the Constitution in order to establish ideological pluralism and political diversity, to strengthen national unity, to eliminate the differences between towns and rural areas, to ensure the separation and the harmonious allocation of executive, judiciary and parliamentary powers; so as to establish a government based on fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights, a national dialogue, and the participation of the population as a whole in major decisions touching upon national life through an effective decentralization.\nThe fourth milestone or fourth commandment of democracy is the right to eat and the right to work. It goes without saying that the right to eat is an integral part of human rights. The existence of a person who is hungry because he is exploded indicts both the oppressor and the authorities who are responsible for enforcing respect for the inalienable and indefeasible right to life. In Haiti, victims of international exploitation have difficulty getting enough to eat because they themselves are being ground by the axes of international exploitation. In the arms race, the nations of the world are devoting to it more than $500 billion b year, or $1.4 billion every day. Only 15 days of such expenditure could eradicate hunger from the planet for many years.\nThe tragedy of hunger arises not out of lack of food but out of a lack of social justice. Work, more work, always work - this is what man needs if he is to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. It has been noted that if the amount being spent on building a B-l bomber were to be spent on constructing dwellings, 70,000 jobs would be created.\nHow can we justify the fact that 71 per cent of Haitian farmers cultivate only a small square of land, less than 1.2 hectares? How can we justify the fact that 30 per cent of the wealthiest landowners in our country own more than two thirds of the arable land?\nWe must rise above the age-old indifference of the dominant political and economic sectors and demand respect for the right to food and the right to work. The hunger of one man is the hunger of all men. Everyone must work to achieve a labouring civilization in which the roots of hunger will be eradicated. The hunger of one man is the hunger of all men.\nWe must go beyond verbiage and explore some of the factual pathways that have been traversed since 7 February 1991. On 7 February 1991 the \\\"lavalas\\\" government began to bring order to the administration. State resources have increased appreciably. In the last four months of the prior government, fiscal and customs revenues stood at a monthly average of\n86.8 million gourdes, in contrast to an average of 122.9 million for the first four months of our \\\"lavalas\\\" government, with a clear upward trend - 137.6 million in the month of June. As for expenditures, in November 1990 the former government spent 164.7 million gourdes; in June 1991, the \\\"lavalas\\\" government spent only 86 million. Thus, for the first time in a long time, public funds showed a surplus of 41 million gourdes.\nAn increase in food production is a necessity. In order to achieve this, we are going to implement the agrarian reform set forth in article 248 of the Constitution and provide peasants with the wherewithal for production. The participation of the private sector is essential for the creation of highly labour-intensive businesses. Whereas in the past illegal practices made it possible for some sectors to plunder the country to the detriment of the vast majority of the population, our \\\"lavalas\\\" government is ensuring respect for the rights of all: the right to invest in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution; the right to work for human and economic growth. To our dear friends and investors abroad, Haiti here and now extends a most cordial and heartfelt welcome.\nThe fifth milestone of the democratic commandment is the right to demand our due. In the past five years the Haitian people have made an outstanding and remarkable contribution to the democratic struggle that is being waged throughout the world. As the democratic tide surged in - in Eastern Europe, in Asia, in the Middle East, South Africa and Central and South America - we in Haiti witnessed an avalanche of democracy we have called \\\"lavalas\\\". No democratic nation can exist in isolation without geopolitical, diplomatic, economic and international ties.\nToday, we see our right to demand our due as part of this network of relationships, in which we can on the one hand recognise the fruits of a rich but impoverished past and on the other discern the fruits of an exploited but hopeful present, thanks to the opportunity we now have to combine a colonised past with a democratic present.\nHeraclitus of Ephesus rightly said: \\\"Awakened men have but one world, but men asleep have each their own.\\\" Awakened men and women of Haiti, our world is a world of justice, justice for all, justice for us Haitians, who have all too often been the victims of social injustice.\nIf we scan the horizon of this world of justice, we wonder how long the impoverished will be forced to cry out, with Democritus: \\\"We seek the good and do not find it; we find evil without seeking it.\\\" In the belief that mens agitat molem - mind can move matter - our policy will continue to be attentive to the masses, who are calling for the respect and dignity due them. The same applies for the treatment inflicted upon so many of our Haitian brothers and sisters who live in foreign lands.\nThe sixth democratic milestone or commandment is: self-defence in the diaspora - the so-called tenth department. Hunted and harassed until 1991 by the blind brutality of the repressive machine, or by the structures of exploitation fashioned into an anti-democratic system, our Haitian sisters and brothers have not always experienced the joy of finding a promised land.\nThey were considered to be illegal because the torturers would not give their victims properly signed certificates of torture; they were considered to be illegal because they had to travel as boat people or without legal identity papers. Rut they made a large contribution to the economic prosperity of bosses who preferred malleable and freely exploitable human labour.\nWhat can we say about our sisters and brothers imprisoned in Krome, end elsewhere? Is it not time, in the name of democracy, to study their cases and turn their suffering into rejoicing? With a view to encouraging the authorities concerned to take the appropriate steps to bring about this long-awaited rejoicing, we in the Haitian Government are constantly fighting against fraudulent practices and the procurement of false visas on Haitian territory.\nAs we address the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, we are expressing ourselves in these terms for the sake of the well-being of our community. We feel bound to denounce and condemn before the whole of mankind the flagrant violation of the rights of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic. While we recognize the sovereignty of the Dominican Republic, we must firmly denounce and condemn this violation of human rights.\nHaiti and the Dominican Republic are the two wings of a single bird, two nations which share the beautiful island of Hispaniola. Echoing the cries of all the victims whose rights are denied them, and in keeping with our commitment to respect human rights, despite the social problems and financial difficulties caused by this forced repatriation, we intend to show respect for both wings of the bird. This is attested to by the welcome that Haiti gives all those men and women who cross our border, be they Haitians or Dominicans. In solidarity with disadvantaged minorities, we call for reparation, as much for Dominican citizens by birth but of Haitian origin as for Haitian citizens who have fallen victim to this repatriation.\nIts not a matter of weeping when one realises what is happening in the Dominican Republic; it is a matter of defending human rights, in the name of the Haitian people, in the name of all men who are really men and all women who are really women throughout the world. Therefore, we Haitians are working together with our Dominican brothers and sisters to be able to live in communion, with a continuing dialogue.\nThat is why, together with Dominican men and women who do not agree with this flouting of human rights, we Haitian men and women, we the entire Haitian people, declare to the world that we demand reparation.\nWe shall always walk side by side with the Dominican people as brothers and sisters, in order to live in peace, but a man worthy of the name can never bow his head when human rights are trampled upon as they now are in the case of Haitians born in the Dominican Republic or in Haiti, Haitians of Dominican origin, or Dominicans of Haitian origin. It is regrettable that the question of colour comes into play even when Dominicans are involved.\nArrested and expelled into Haitian territory, they generally have no homes, familial or employment. Conservative estimates place the number of repatriated persons at more than 50,000 already. In the hope that the international agencies concerned will assist us to ensure respect for fundamental human rights, we here and now solemnly proclaim with pride and dignity that never again shall our Haitian sisters and brothers be sold so that their blood may be converted into bitter sugar. Blood in bitter sugar is unacceptable - and the unacceptable shall not be accepted.\nI hope that my Dominican brothers and sisters will always walk side by side with us in dialogue so that together we may protect the rights of all Dominicans and Haitians. I say to my Dominican brothers, whom I love so much: let us go forward together to build a world of peace.\nThe seventh democratic milestone or commandment is: No to violence, yes to \\\"lavalas\\\". Is an unarmed political revolution possible in 19917 Yes. Incredible, but true. This is \\\"lavalas\\\" teachings the tactical and strategic convergence of democratic forces brandishes the weapon of unity to combat that of violence. A stunning victory, a historic surprise! In the schools of the poor, the teaching of active non-violence and of unity is triumphing over institutionalized violence. 1804 was the date of our first independence, but 1991 marks the beginning of the era of our second independence.\nIs there any democratic nation that is capable of remaining indifferent to this victory of non-violence precisely where structures of economic violence still exist? Is it legitimate to try the patience of the victims of economic violence? There is no policy apart from relationships of strength, but there Is also no economy apart from relationships of interest.\nBecause of the restoration of peace, the capital of non-violence that the Haitian masses have invested is yielding considerable economic interest. A simple psycho-social analysis is very eloquent. For the more social ego is attacked by oligarchic sclerosis, the healthier it becomes, psychologically, politically and economically. The teaching of non-violence should arouse a collective awareness of our land of non-violence. Ours is a land of non-violence, where 85 per cent of the population is still crushed by economic violence, is still illiterate - but is not stupid. Making these victims literate requires help from the true friends of Haiti - not simply friends, but true friends. You who are our true friends, work with us not as observers but as performers, as citizens of the world. We hope we can count on your cooperation in our literacy campaign. Any cooperation at this level attests to a determination to combat economic violence by active non-violence. Where the guns of violence sound, let the sun of non-violence shine in the \\\"lavalas\\\" spirit.\nThe eighth democratic milestone or commandment is: faithfulness to the human being - the ultimate wealth. To speak of the human being as the ultimate wealth may perhaps suggest that one is disregarding gold, oil and dollars. Far from it. There is wealth and wealth. According to certain experts, if the hydro-electric potential of the United States were to be fully exploited, it could provide more energy than all the oil consumed in the world.\nAll these riches should he placed at the service of mankind - the axis of the \\\"lavalas\\\" policy. We are ready to demonstrate our faithfulness to that approach by embracing anything that can promote the full development of the human being. Thus the harmonious links that we have already established with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are part of the framework of Caribbean solidarity, with a view to more effectively fostering human well-being.\nWe are also working to expand South-South relations, between us and our neighbours in Latin America. It goes without saying that South-South relationships are not the only important relationships for Haiti. For we share a political heritage with the United States, whose independence reminds us of the Haitian pioneers who fought and died precisely for the same independence. France, with which we also share a political heritage, the United States and other countries of North America, and the countries of Europe, of the Middle East, of Africa and of other parts of the world form a part, together with us, of the interdependent network of nations throughout the world.\nWe patriotically hail the Haitian men and women living in Cuba, and we also hail Cuba and the Cuban people, to whom we address our wishes for peace and democratic growth. We address the same good wishes for peace and democratic growth to the Middle East and South Africa. In recent years the United Nations, under the guidance of Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, has demonstrated that, given the means, it can be effective in settling conflicts. This is attested to by the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq, the independence of Namibia and the dawning of a solution to the question of Western Sahara. Further proof of this is the way in which the United Nations, in accordance with its Charter, reacted when one of the States Members of the Organisation fell victim to such cruel aggression on 2 August 1990 at the hands of Iraq. The manner in which the conflict was handled raised some legitimate reservations, but the role of the United Nations was never challenged. Nevertheless, the Gulf crisis has given rise to a number of still unanswered questions.\nWe all know that, in spite of the efforts of the United Nations, there are still parts of the world where divergent interests and lack of understanding between peoples continue to cause conflicts between States and within them. Despite the victories of the people of Azania over the juridical apparatus of the apartheid system, we are far from reaching the peak - that is, democracy.\nOut of our sense of unity with the black people of Africa, who should enjoy all the rights recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we take this opportunity to appeal to the international community and, above all, the industrialised countries not to lift the comprehensive sanctions decreed against the Pretoria regime at this early stage. In its diametrical opposition to apartheid, the Republic of Haiti is struggling to ensure that the black majority of South Africa enjoys its rights to the full in a multiracial and democratic society. Bravo Mandela! Honour to Mandela!\nIf the memory of Mandela evokes such applause as I am hearing now, applause is surely due the memory of another truly great man - Martin Luther King.\nThe Haitian Government has noted with satisfaction the cease-fire recently arrived at between the parties in conflict in Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the process now under way.\nThe suffering of a single individual is the suffering of mankind. Our policy aims at providing, day after day, eloquent testimony to our faithfulness to man.\nThe ninth democratic milestone or commandment 1st faithfulness to our culture. The \\\"lavalas\\\" praxis intertwines cultural links at the very heart of the political universe. Resistance to cultural alienation guarantees the psychological health of the democratic fabric. For any cultural suicide leads to the devitalisation of the social body and cannot but threaten the democratic cells of the body.\nTo live, and live to the full, is also to draw nourishment from the source of one's culture. To live to the full is to send one's roots deep down to the source of one's culture.\n\nThis embraces the totality of the life of a people. What is involved here is a depth of being that must be delved and explored, and by this being we mean a fabric of relationships, pluri-dimensional relationships. Defining man not as an end but as a bridge, Friedrich Nietzsche places him - whether we like it or not - at the crossing point of the process of acculturation and inculturation. What is involved is a transmission of cultural seed which may give life to the being or wound it in its very essence.\nThe germs of pathologic culpability transmitted by contact between so-called dominant and dominated cultures can only be damaging to any democratic growth. The \\\"lavalas\\\" praxis seeks to give our cultural identity its true value. Any in-depth change can be achieved democratically only if indigenous values are interweaved in a particular social-cultural tissue.\nThis faithfulness to the culture of mankind prompts us to share the concerns of the, Kurdish people, the Palestinian people, the Jewish people, the peoples of Iraq - all cherishing the roots of their beings.\nIn this context of respect and peace, the Republic of Haiti warmly welcomes the accession of the two Koreas to the family of the United Nations.\nFidelity to our culture prompts us to sharpen our critical senses in order to protect our culture's health against certain evils such as illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs. The Haitian Government wishes to recall that effective work to combat the production of drugs also involves greater assistance to Latin American countries.\nAs far as drug trafficking itself is concerned, it is important to recall that it is generated and fuelled by the demand that comes from the North. Thus, at all cost, stimuli to production from the consumers of the industrialised countries must be eliminated. Concerted action between the States of the North and those of the South, with the assistance of the United Nations, would make it possible more effectively to combat this evil of drugs in its devastating effects on men and women.\nThe tenth - and last - landmark, or tenth democratic commandment: all around the tablet\nYes, all around the democratic table. Not a minority on the table Nor a majority under the table But all around the democratic table.\nWe are faced with an historic encounter as we approach 1992. It is an historic encounter on the eve of the 500th anniversary of the evangelisation and of the struggle of the Haitian people to survive and to retain its dignity and identity. As we approach this 500th anniversary of resistance, both qualitative and quantitative, we can speak of a meeting around the table. This is in truth a real challenge facing us at the threshold of the third millennium.\nBrothers and sisters of Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad, Cuba, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Martinique and so on, our past in the struggle against colonialism leads us inevitably to establish stronger and deeper links throughout our progress towards the Democratic Table.\nA new social contract at the Caribbean, Latin American and international levels is necessary so that we may all one day meet around the Democratic Table.\nSince 16 December 1990, the date of elections held under the lofty sponsorship of the United Nations, we in Haiti have been moving towards that meeting-place.\n\nIf we are all to get there, it is time that indebtedness cease to affect a net transfer of resources from our impoverished countries to the rich countries. In fact, between 1983 and 1988, the net transfer of resources to the so-called developed countries amounted to $115 billion. For one year alone, 1989, that transfer amounted to approximately $60 billion - financial resources the countries of the South desperately need for growth,\nI hope that the Fourth Decade will yield positive results in the context of the new international order that is to be established. At this close of the twentieth century, the Republic of Haiti renounces absolute power, embraces participative democracy and sings the hymn of liberty, pride and dignity - liberty won; pride regained; dignity reborn. At this close of the twentieth century, the Republic of Haiti has the honour to hail the unity of nations: the United Nations for a united world; the United Nations through united peoples.\nAs for the Haitian people, we once again hail its heroic courage, crying out tirelessly and in the spirit of \\\"lavalas\\\":\nIt is better to perish with the people than to succeed without the people. But with the people there can be no defeat. So victory is ours. In the same vein: we believe in Man; where a Man is exploited, call on us. To your call we will respond \\\"yes\\\", 77 times \\\"yes\\\". To exploitation we will answer \\\"no\\\", 77 times \\\"no\\\". To defend human rights, such is the mission of the United Nations. We believe in peace; where war rages, call on us. To your call, we will answer \\\"yes\\\", 77 times \\\"yes\\\". To war we will answer \\\"no\\\", 77 times \\\"no\\\". Guaranteeing peace, such is the mission of the United Nations.\nWe believe in the brotherhood of peoples. Wherever people turn away from each other, call on us. To your call we shall answer \\\"yes\\\", 77 times \\\"yes\\\". To rejection we shall answer \\\"no\\\", 77 times \\\"no\\\". To be a place for dialogue: that is the mission of the United Nations.\nWe believe in the Haitian people. Wherever they are struggling tirelessly in the \\\"lavalas\\\" spirit, we shall be; we shall always be there. It is better to perish with the people than to succeed without the people.\nWith the echo of this creed resounding in our ears, by way of conclusion let the echo of the democratic creed also resound. We believe in these ten democratic commandments. We believe in this democratic policy. We believe in that meeting where there will be no minority on the table and no majority under the table, but where everyone will be seated around the democratic table. So be it in the name of the people, of its sons and of its Holy Spirit. Amen.\nUnited we are strong. United in the Caribbean we are a Power. United in the world we are a power for peace, justice, love and freedom.\nHave we the right to speak here? If we have, let us say it together so that the echo can be heard in Haiti.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure, Sir, to extend to you and to your country, Saudi Arabia, the warm congratulations of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. At this time, when we are required to take major decisions on the future of our Organization, your own considerable diplomatic experience affords us a quality of leadership which will assuredly enhance our debates and guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.\nMy Government is also pleased to commend the work of your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, whose diplomatic skills, knowledge and efficiency were at all times evident during the conduct of the forty-fifth session.\nTrinidad and Tobago applauds the current advances towards universal membership in the United Nations, with the historic admission to this Organization last month of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, as well as the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. As a small archipelagic State, Trinidad and Tobago is also particularly pleased with the admission to membership of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. On behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago, I extend warm and sincere congratulations to all the new Members. Their admission is testimony to the profound and unprecedented changes which have taken place in the international system.\nIn many ways the international community seems poised on the brink of what could be a brave new era. The dramatic and far-reaching changes of the past few years have radically transformed the political and economic contours of the international landscape. In many parts of the world stern and rigid authoritarian systems, the legacy of ideologies which placed the interests of the State and of ruling elites before the social well-being of the majority, has been weakened and brushed aside. They have been vanquished by one of the most powerful and enduring urges of mankind - the desire to enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms. It is this urge that has conferred upon the present period one of its most appealing characteristics, namely, widespread democratisation and liberalisation.\nOne of the major consequences of these unprecedented changes has been a dramatic improvement in the international political climate. Antagonism and hostility are increasingly being replaced by cooperation and coordination. This has been most vividly reflected in the new effectiveness of the United Nations. Freed of the constraining fetters of great-Power confrontation, the world body has been in a position to play a central and constructive role in international affairs. The United Nations is finally becoming the dynamic international mechanism envisaged by its founding fathers.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and his representatives must be congratulated on the active and influential role they have played in so many areas of tension - Cambodia, Western Sahara, El Salvador - and on their expert handling of a number of sensitive issues, such as the release of hostages in the Middle East, the aftermath of the war in the Gulf and the Middle East question.\nThese important and positive developments should encourage our hope in a brighter future. Our optimism is, however, tempered by the number and the complexity of the challenges that continue to burden the international community, some of long standing, others of more recent vintage.\nForemost among them is the increasing disparity between rich and poor nations. After decades of development efforts the problems of widespread poverty and deprivation that afflict the majority of the world population continue to be a burning issue. Poverty in itself is a threat to international peace and security. Its eradication, therefore, should constitute a major part of the peacemaking mandate of the United Nations.\nChanges in economic and political ideology are resulting in a fresh approach to economic policies in the developing world. The new economics of development is becoming increasingly pragmatic. Greater importance is being accorded to the balance and interaction between the market, the State and the private sector. Similarly, economic development is increasingly being measured by the improvement and the enrichment of the lives of people and not by impersonal economic indicators. Authentic development, it is recognized, must be sustainable, multi-dimensional and people-oriented.\nEfforts at the national level to redress the adverse economic situation cannot succeed unless there is a less hostile international economic environment. The assistance of the international community through the provision of aid, loans and investment funds is also crucial. In this context we hope that the efforts being made to facilitate the integration of the Eastern European countries into the international economy will not take place to the detriment of the developing world.\nThe economic problems of the developing world are compounded by the burden of external debt. This issue needs to be urgently and comprehensively addressed. The absence of a durable solution remains a blight upon the efforts of those countries to achieve growth and development. Several debt-alleviation proposals have been advanced over the past few years. However, the stock of debt continues to grow and has now attained the staggering figure of $1.2 trillion. The massive burden and the repayment and servicing trauma that it has engendered will not only continue to impose severe hardship on the people of the developing countries, but will sharpen the disparity between rising affluence in some parts of our international community and increasing chronic poverty in others. In the developing countries themselves, the drain of resources created by the external debt and service payments contributes to heightened social tensions, jeopardizing respect for human rights and the preservation of democracy in those countries.\nTrade and trade opportunities remain pivotal in any effort to reactivate the economies of the developing world. In those countries structural adjustment has been widely utilized in an effort to create economic structures that are rational, viable and self-sustaining. However, we are faced with a paradoxical situation. Competitive exports resulting from the structural-adjustment programmes and economic diversification that the developing countries were urged to undertake are being barred from the market-places in the North by a new wave of protectionism. Moreover, this coincides with a period of historically low commodity prices. These developments are very grave for developing countries and particularly for small economies in which production possibilities are limited by size and resource endowment.\nTrinidad and Tobago is firmly of the view that the most effective way to address the trade problem is through the multilateral negotiations taking place in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). However, commitments made by members during negotiations must be honoured and the special situation and needs of developing countries must be taken into account in the present effort to reach agreement on outstanding issues.\nThe emergence of economic mega-blocs could very well be a mixed blessing. Should they become inward-looking, erecting import barriers, new problems could arise. However, if they function as nuclei of genuine free trade they could also strengthen the pillars of the multilateral system, a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round will indeed assist in ensuring that the emergence of these large trading blocs will have a positive effect on the global economy.\nUnrestricted access to markets in the developed countries will undoubtedly facilitate the creation of an environment that is more propitious for developing countries. A crucial variable in the development matrix, nevertheless, is science and technology for development. Science and technology define the gap between developed and developing countries, between one world that basks in affluence and another that is mired in poverty and deprivation.\nTrinidad and Tobago notes with concern the diminution of resources directed by the United Nations towards science and technology for development. Developing countries, hamstrung as they are by limited resources, rely heavily on the work and activities of international institutions like the United Nations. It is imperative that science and technology be designated a major priority area in the allocation of resources for development by this body.\nThe challenge of protecting our environment is an issue to which the international community is paying increased attention. In both the developed and the developing world there is a keener perception today of the need to integrate ecological considerations into economic planning in order to achieve sustainable development.\nMy delegation perceives a need, however, to shift the ongoing debate from its concentration upon issues that appear pertinent only to the developed world to a focus which takes the entire global community into account. The environment is par excellence a global issue. As such, addressing it requires global cooperation. This underlines the importance of the need for coordinated international responses to environmental problems. The forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED), which will take place in Brazil in 1992, will play a vital role in this regard. In a related process, island developing States, aware of the grave threat that climate change and sea-level rise may pose to their very existence, have already formed themselves into the interregional Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and have undertaken a critical coordinating role in the climate negotiations to be completed before the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development.\nAt this time of general economic decline in many countries, the international community's attention and commitment to the resolution of the consequent social ills are crucial. Social issues must of necessity assume greater importance on the international agenda.\nThe enormous challenges facing small and large States alike in their fight against domestic and international criminal activities, as well as the dangerous inter linkages between the various forms of organized transnational crimes, such as terrorism and international drug trafficking, dictate that comprehensive, concerted and practical prescriptions be formulated to alleviate these problems.\nThe illicit use of and trafficking in drugs are recognized as a social plague and a threat to the international community. This scourge is of a transnational character, and the response of the international community must, in like manner, emphasize international cooperation and collaboration and the provision of adequate financial resources. Trinidad and Tobago supports the consolidation of United Nations activities within the new international drug control programme. This development should allow for a coherent and integrated strategy. The new institution, however, will be able to make an impact on the well-organized and lucrative trade in death and degradation only if it is provided with adequate human and financial resources.\nSimilarly, given the grave effects world-wide of other aspects of international criminal activity, we believe that the United Nations must adopt a concerted approach to crime prevention and criminal justice. As a member of the Inter-governmental Working Group on the Creation of an Effective International Crime and Criminal Justice Programme, which met in Austria last August, Trinidad and Tobago fully approves the recommendation that a new United Nations crime-prevention and criminal-justice programme be established to provide, inter alia, practical assistance for States in their fight against national and transnational crime. Like other small States, we can ill afford to continue diverting limited resources from development programmes and projects into the fight against a growing tide of criminal activity. My delegation therefore calls on this Assembly to designate the proposed new criminal-justice programme as a priority within the 1992-97 medium-term plan.\nIn his address to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Mr. A. N. R. Robinson, observed: \\\"Neither a free State nor a free world can long endure without adequate safeguards for the rule of law,\\\" (A/45/PV.20, p. 31) Trinidad and Tobago welcomed the decision to declare this final decade of the twentieth century the United Nations Decade of International Law. We were also encouraged to find that areas of international law that might be ready for progressive development and codification are being identified.\nMy delegation strongly believes that the elaboration of a code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind, the codification of international criminal law and the establishment of an international criminal court are tasks that should be tackled very early in the decade. At its forty-third session the International Law Commission carefully examined draft proposals for the establishment of an international criminal court. Trinidad and Tobago has long argued that such a court would be an effective adjunct to domestic administrative and judicial arrangements, and would provide greater protection for the security and sovereignty of States, particularly small States. Questions relating to jurisdiction and the institution of criminal proceedings continue to be debated. However, the real progress that has already been made in elaborating the draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind should encourage States to give serious consideration to the proposals and comments of the International Law Commission and facilitate the drafting, at the next session of that body, of a statute for an international criminal court.\nI wish to turn now to an item which the hectic events of the last few months may have removed from our consciousness, but which Trinidad and Tobago still considers to be of vital importance. I refer to the desire for self-determination that some small States still nurture. At this pivotal time in history, when the struggle for freedom is bearing fruit in Europe and elsewhere, we should do well to remember that, despite the progress made in the area of decolonization, there remain a number of small dependencies, especially in the Caribbean and in the Pacific, that have not had the opportunity to shape their own destiny.\nIt is essential that these States be accorded the respect that comes with the right to choose how they will face the future. They need to know that their hopes and aspirations are still taken seriously by this body. And, to facilitate the making of wise choices, they need the breadth of sound information on which such choices must be based. Trinidad and Tobago sincerely hopes that new life will be injected into the decolonisation debate and that all the administering Powers will return to participate actively in the work of the Committee concerned, bringing with them their wealth of knowledge and experience of the interlink ages between economy, security and independence in the modern world. By doing so they will surely assist the United Nations in carrying out its special responsibilities to these territories.\nThe recent successes of the United Nations in some of the most volatile regions of the world should not lull us into a false sense of security. Many regional conflicts stem from causes that are purely Indigenous in nature and will therefore erupt despite the end of super-Power rivalry. Territorial disagreements, traditional animosities and new hatreds will continue to contribute to instability in many parts of the globe. The role of the United Nations in the preservation of international peace and stability will therefore continue to be vital,\nTrinidad and Tobago believes that regional organizations also must play a more important role in anticipating instability and in pre-empting conflict. They can do so by facilitating reconciliation between antagonistic States, by contributing to the establishment or preservation of democratic government, and by promoting peaceful internal change. In this regard we applaud the recent signing of the peace accord between the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN), as well as the equally recent rapprochement between Belize and Guatemala. We hope that, in the interests of hemispheric collaboration, relations between two other member States - Cuba and the United States of America - will also be normalized. Trinidad and Tobago has always been, and remains, firmly committed to both the ideal and the practice of democracy. He therefore strongly condemn the military coup that took place on Monday in Haiti, overthrowing the constitutionally elected Government of that country and compromising the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Haiti's population. We deplore the ensuing loss of life and call for the prompt restoration of the constitutionally elected authority. \nIt is regrettable that, even as the international climate improves and major agreements for the reduction of nuclear weapons are concluded, the proliferation of conventional weapons and military technology continues apace. The countries of the developing world account for 75 per cent of the purchases of arms traded each year. The Gulf Mar has served to remind us of the dangers of the proliferation of weapons, especially to the volatile regions of the world. There is no doubt that there is a need for stricter monitoring of the arms flows and for international agreements regulating and limiting the trade in weapons and military technology. Trinidad and Tobago therefore supports the proposal to establish, at the United Nations, a register for arms transfers.\nNotwithstanding the profound reforms which have taken place in South Africa, the situation in that country continues to be a source of concern. At a time when the protection of human rights has become a central concern of the international community. South Africa remains a major transgressor in this area. Racial discrimination persists, political prisoners await release and the Draconian security laws are yet to be repealed. The fundamental right of one-man one-vote is still denied the majority of South Africans. Trinidad and Tobago has always been committed to a peaceful end to apartheid through negotiations. It has therefore been gravely concerned about escalating violence in the townships of South Africa. We trust that the recent peace accord will help bring an end to this violence, which threatens to delay progress towards the commencement of multi-party negotiations on constitutional reform.\nTrinidad and Tobago remains supportive of the current peaceful process towards a free, non-racial, democratic and united South Africa. We are likewise still convinced that this process of peaceful change will be facilitated by the retention of economic and military sanctions against South Africa, until the profound and irreversible changes outlined in the 1989 United Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa have been completed.\nThe international context in which the United Nations is operating today bears little or no resemblance to that of the 1940s, when the world body was established. The United Nations and its mechanisms were developed primarily to respond to a world dominated by super-Power rivalry and conflict. Trinidad and Tobago believes that the time has come to reappraise the mechanisms of the world body so that it can adapt to radically changed circumstances. To this end, the collective security machinery of the United Nations must be enhanced. It will also have to be given the capacity to anticipate and prevent breaches of the peace and threats to security. Most of all, the United Nations decision-making machinery must be made to reflect the common interests of all its Members and not just those of a powerful few. This is the fundamental challenge which faces our Organization today if it is to achieve a more balanced, just and equitable world order.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, many speakers who preceded me to this rostrum have been more than eloquent in describing the rare qualities of leadership you bring to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. What more can we add other than to assure you, Sir, that we too repose our confidence unstintingly in your ability to steer the deliberations of this momentous session to a fruitful conclusion. And we congratulate you, most sincerely, on your election to this high office. The distinguished Foreign Minister of Malta lived up to our expectations during his tenure of office. We salute him for a job well done.\nWe welcome to our midst the seven new Members that have just joined the United Nations. We wish them well. An increase of seven new Members can only enhance the strength and vitality of our Organization and advance it further towards universality.\nUnder the stable and purposeful leadership of our indefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations has continued to respond forcefully and creatively to the fast-changing panorama of human history. The past year has been particularly challenging, and even daunting, for our Secretary-General and for the United Nations. The Gulf crisis which was in full bloom during our last session, early this year burgeoned into a full-scale war whose consequences are still reverberating. Thankfully, a renascent United Nations was not found wanting in its response to the crisis; aggression has been defeated; the Emirate of Kuwait has been liberated. We salute the Secretary-General under whose leadership the United Nations has been given a new lease on life.\nAs the old world of nuclear terror, political tyranny and ideological confrontation gives way to the new world in which our major preoccupation is whether we have the capacity \\\"to execute the increasingly versatile projects of peace\\\", (A/46/1, page 4) to quote the Secretary-General's report the leading role of the United Nations in the shaping of the new world order has become very crucial indeed. As the Secretary-General's report also states. \\\"The effectiveness of the United Nations can no longer be in doubt\\\". (Ibid.) \nWhat continues to be in doubt, in our view, is our readiness, we the Members of the Organization, to give the United Nations the wherewithal to perform its escalating tasks. The peace that is breaking out everywhere in the world needs nurturing while, at the same time, new conflicts now erupting as a consequence of the precipitate expiration of the old order are threatening the new world order in its infancy. And we expect the United Nations, trammelled by unpaid arrears and late payment of contributions, to rise to the occasion, to police peace and manage conflict with an empty treasury. Mission impossible!\nNevertheless, the world is changing for the better. A new cycle of history whose character we must all participate in shaping has begun. Throughout the globe today the common man and woman are insisting on regaining mastery of their destiny. Multi-party democracy has become the common clarion call of mankind, a triumphant affirmation of the phenomenon of peoples' power. Be it in Africa, Eastern Europe or elsewhere in the world today, an inexorable process of renewal is in progress.\nAnd yet as the struggle for democratic pluralism intensifies new conflicts arise while old and hitherto suppressed antagonisms are set free. The historical excesses of extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism are threatening the peaceful evolution of the new world order we all seek to nurture. Change is not coming peacefully everywhere. It rarely does. Our hearts go out to the people of Yugoslavia and other Eastern European States that are caught in the throes of difficult and painful transitions. This is what the Secretary-General, with his usual candour and precision, calls \\\"a unique juxtaposition of promise and perils\\\" (A/46/1, p. 5).\nIn our view, however, the promise is transcendent. A world free of the threat of nuclear holocaust and political tyranny and totalitarianism is not necessarily bereft of conflict, but it is the best insurance for peace and tranquillity among nations and peoples. There is the understandable fear and anxiety that we have begun the era of monopolarity, the domination of the world by one super-Power unrestrained by the checks and balances of bipolarity, and that more tyranny and fear is likely to be perpetrated by the lone super-Power in the new world order. Such apprehensions are understandable, even as we fervently cherish the hope that with a strengthened United Nations and the ascendancy of economics as the locus of power the new world order will be one characterized by democratic multipolarity driven by interdependent economic competition. And it must be emphasized that a durable new world order can result only from our united efforts, not from a lone super-Power's fiat.\nThe agenda of the forty-sixth session is, like its predecessors, long and varied. This is an indication that we still have a long way to go to resolve the many problems that confront our Organization. It is hoped that the new mood at the United Nations will enhance our capacity to search for solutions to these problems.\nWe have seen how successful the United Nations can be if its endeavours in the service of peace enjoy the support of its membership in both the Security Council and the General Assembly. The Security Council, in particular, has demonstrated that, united, it can act decisively as a preserver of international peace and security. In Asia, at long last the end of the Cambodian tragedy appears to be at hand. The parties to that long-festering conflict which has wasted millions of Innocent lives have finally agreed on an electoral system to be lined to conduct, multiparty democratic elections. Here again the Instrumentality of the United Nations as an impartial arbiter in the resolution of Intractable problems has proved its undoubted efficacy.\nUnfortunately, Afghanistan is still bleeding, a continued victim, not of the United Nations failure to devise a successful solution to the civil war there but, rather, a victim of the refusal by the parties to the civil war to implement the letter and spirit of the United Nations Geneva Agreements. It is hoped that the recent decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to terminate the supply of arms to the belligerents will starve both parties of the incentive to prolong the needless blood-letting.\nBut the United States and the Soviet Union are not the only suppliers of arms to the belligerents. Consequently, the United Nations must make it clear that subsidiary suppliers of arms to fuel and sustain the Afghan tragedy are also duty bound to respect United Nations-brokered peace agreements.\nIn the Middle East, the guns of war are silent at least on the Iraq Kuwait front. Thank God, Kuwait's freedom and independence have been restored. A dangerous precedent has not been allowed to scar the face of humanity - that a small, defenceless independent and sovereign State be obliterated from the face of the earth with impunity by a powerful neighbour. We can argue interminably about the excesses or depredations of Desert Storm, but the reality is that the restoration of Kuwait's existence as a free and independent nation has reassured small, powerless and defenceless States, like my own, of their inalienable right to exist as free and independent nations - provided, of course, that from now on there will be no selective morality in the treatment of aggression by the powerful against the weak. \nThe Cyprus question remains as stubborn as ever. There is what is called new thinking in the world today and the world is changing so fast that the sap-makers have thrown up their arms in despair and frustration. And yet some things are refusing to change. One of them is the tragic division of the idyllic island of Cyprus, a non-aligned and Commonwealth country that threatens no one. A lot of time and energy has been expended in the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem by the Secretary-General over the years without much luck. The parties are still set in their old positions, oblivious of the buffeting winds of change around them. Cyprus must be reunited, to take its rightful place in the new world order.\nThe Middle East also remains frozen in the unremitting immobility of the seemingly irreconcilable positions of its conflicting nations. Lebanon has taken decisive steps, towards internal peace and national reconciliation while the people of Palestine remain homeless. Israel is continuing to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied territories while processing a commitment to negotiations to reconcile the national aspirations of the Jewish people and their Arab neighbours. Creating facts on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza runs the risk of ensuring the failure of negotiations even before they start.\nBotswana fully supports the United States initiative aimed at convening a Middle East peace conference, where, we hope, the nations of the area and the Palestinian people will come together at a conference table to find common ground for the harmonization of their conflicting nationalisms. The United States initiative represents an opportunity which can only be missed or wasted at great peril to peace. Israel has the opportunity of a lifetime to satisfy itself that all the Palestinians want is a home of their own in the West Bank and Gaza, and not the obliteration of the Jewish State from the face of the Middle East. The Palestinians, equally, ate presented with a rare opportunity to clarify whether Israel wants peace, or confirmation of Its territorial conquests.\nIn southern Africa, the situation gives grounds for hope. The last vestige of white minority rule is about to be expunged. South Africa la In the throes of dramatic change despite the seemingly Insoluble urban violence that has created the perception that black South Africans cannot realise that the moment of reckoning has arrived violence evidently orchestrated by sinister elements that are bent on frustrating the birth of a new nation in that strife torn country. \nThe people of South Africa stand poised at the gate of the new South Africa they have sought all these years. The apartheid scaffolding has been removed and dismantled even though the structure - the structure of apartheid - remains intact. The legislative basis of apartheid has been removed for the first time in more than 300 years, and South Africa for all South Africans regardless of colour, race or creed is ready to be negotiated.\nThere is no time to waste. The conditions of the United Nations consensus Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa may not have been met in letter and spirit, but the time has come for the people of South Africa to proceed to the Conference table to negotiate a new democratic dispensation for their country. The Abuja statement on South Africa issued by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Ad Hoc Committee in July 1991 is unequivocal about the urgent need for negotiations to begin:\n\\\"The Committee underscores the fact that central to the struggle for the eradication of apartheid is the transfer of power to a democratic government elected on the basis of a non-racial and democratic constitution. It reasserts that negotiations leading to the drawing up and adoption of this constitution is now the most urgent and pressing question. To this end, it calls upon the national liberation movements and all the anti-apartheid forces to work in concert within the framework of a patriotic front.\\\" (A/46/450, annex, para, 4)\nThe situation in South Africa today is almost a replica of the situation in Namibia during the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in that territory. If we are expecting the establishment of perfect peace in South Africa as a prelude to the commencement of the negotiations for a new \nSouth Africa we are expecting the impossible. The closer we are to the realisation of the new South Africa the more desperate and vicious will be the resistance. The negotiations themselves are most likely to be accompanied by the escalation of violence, inspired or free-wheeling, in the townships and elsewhere in South Africa.\nOf utmost importance at this crucial Juncture is the adoption of a democratic constitution to end once and for all minority rule in South Africa. Political prisoners have been released and are being released and will all be released simply because there is no sense whatsoever in keeping them incarcerated. General amnesty, however Imperfect, is now in place under the trusted auspices of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which guarantees the safe repatriation of exiles. The repressive laws that have formed the foundation of apartheid and have been the object of the United Nations anti-apartheid campaign for close to half a century have been abolished. There is today an atmosphere of relatively free political activity in South Africa, free enough at least to allow the convening of an all-party conference to negotiate a new constitution.\nNevertheless, the United Nations must continue to insist on the cessation of violence in the townships and elsewhere in the country so that an atmosphere auspicious for negotiation could be created in South Africa. While the onus for the maintenance of law and order rests with the South African Government, black leaders are also duty bound to contribute to the search for a national solution to the destructive violence. It does nobody any good simply to stand, watch and criticize and allow the dark and sinister forces of hired thugs and assassins to cheat the people of South Africa of their right to be free from the scourge of racial tyranny.\nWe are pleased that the United Nations Western Sahara operation was set in motion on 6 September 1990. It is hoped that the two parties to that conflict will cooperate with the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General to ensure that a successful referendum to settle the question of Western Sahara once and for all is held on schedule.\nIn Central America, it is hoped that the leaders of El Salvador will cooperate with the Secretary-General In his efforts to facilitate negotiations to end the ruinous civil war that has threatened to bleed the country to death. We urge the Security Council to continue to take a keen interest in the issue.\nOver the years the world has seen the emergence and growth of what some call a \\\"borderless economy\\\"; and yet the world economy has continued to be controlled by the macroeconomic policies of a handful of countries. We cannot talk about democracy, good governance and transparency at the national level and deny the application of these principles to the management of the international economic system. It is appropriate and indeed desirable that pluralism find a niche in the macroeconomic management of the global economy. The major players in the \\\"borderless economy\\\" should appreciate that this is in their self-interest too. The persistence of the world's economic ills is a sore reminder that some of the prescriptions which are preferred by the major actors have fallen short of addressing the root cause of the problems. The involvement of other States will provide alternative approaches to dealing with these problems.\nBotswana welcomes the proposal made by the Secretary General on 3 July 1991 in his opening statement at the second regular session of the Economic and Social Counci1 on the convening of an international conference on development financing. We are pleased that this issue will be given serious consideration during this session of the General Assembly. How that the distracting East/West divide has been eliminated the time la opportune to attend to the real problems facing humanity. Some of the vast, resources that have been spent to produce and maintain weapons of mass destruction should now be channelled towards pressing development problems. It is our sincere hope that the current climate of consensus will be fully taken advantage of in order to reach a satisfactory decision.\nWe look forward to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The integration of Eastern and Central Europe into the world economy entails the need for greater access to markets. Resource flows to developing countries and the economies in transit ion alone, without increased trade opportunities, cannot lead to sustained and sustainable development. There is a new sense of urgency to bring protectionism to an end.\nAfrica's critical economic situation persists. In many countries the situation has deteriorated. The continent is faced with a crippling debt burden. At the end of 1990 Africa's debt amounted to over $270 billion. Although this amount may appear small compared to global debt figures, the seriousness and enormity of the problem can be readily appreciated when one takes into account the debt-service ratios which are so high that most of the export revenues are used to repay debt instead of financing development- The reduction 'A debt obligations should be made a major priority if Africa is to be able to face the development: challenge in the 1990s. African countries fully understand their responsibility in tackling these problems. They accept the need for policy coordination aimed at affectively dealing with the developmental problems. It is important that the special needs of Africa are not only kept on the International agenda hut that genuine efforts are also made to resolve them.\nBotswana attaches the utmost importance to issues of environment and development. The conservation of our renewable and non-renewable resources in a major component in the formulation and implementation of development policies. Since independence Botswana has enacted a variety of laws aimed at addressing environmental issues. Last year we adopted a national conservation strategy with a view to ensuring effective coordination between issues of environment and development. The areas of major concern are range-land degradation, the use of wood fuel without replanting trees, the mining of groundwater, the reduction of wildlife species, the generation of wastes which pollute soil and water, and the abandonment of open mining shafts and quarry pits.\nIt is Botswana's policy that the responsibility for conservation and protection of the environment should fall upon those who own and/or manage the country's resources. These include communities, farmers, livestock owners, small enterprises and industrialists. In this respect the Government requires sound environmental impact studies for major development projects. It is the aim of Botswana to ensure that the prices of such resources as land, water and forests reflect the scarcity values in order to increase awareness of the need to conserve such resources.\nBotswana is committed to playing its part in dealing with issues of environment. But there are limitations as to what a poor developing country can do on its own, given the fact that the question of development is an important aspect of a nation's capacity to address the environmental challenges. In view of this, the 1992 Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will be a historic landmark in multilateral cooperation. It is our fervent hope that the Conference will adopt concrete decisions aimed at addressing the link between environment and development. Many people in developing countries live in abject poverty, and for the poor long-term sustainabi1ity plays an insignificant role in decisions on production and consumption. What is uppermost in their minds is how to survive or live from one day to the next. Poverty breeds environmental degradation, which in turn reproduces and reinforces poverty. This first world summit on environment and development should address those issues in clear and unambiguous terms. This would involve, among other things, assisting developing countries to gain access to environmentally sound technologies.\nBotswana reaffirms its faith in the United Nations. This unique Organisation has served us well despite the severe constraints that have so often in the past, frustrated its endeavours In the service of peace. Released from those constraints and infused with a new dynamism and a renewed sense of purpose, the United Nations has the capacity to give form and shape and meaning to the new world order for the good of mankind as a whole.\nFinally, it is our fervent hope that Africa's bid for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations will be crowned with success. All we ask is to be allowed the opportunity to serve on the thirty-eighth floor.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is truly an honour for me to address a body that embraces all the countries of the world - the United Nations. I come to this forum representing the beloved and much-tried people of Guatemala - a people which, throughout its history, has remained faithful to its ideals of freedom and to the unswerving struggle for its advancement, but which, at the same time, has had to face a fierce onslaught of violence of all kinds that has placed unfair limits on its development. Nevertheless, our people has maintained its faith and trust in a better future, and its fighting spirit in pursuing what it deems to be fair and necessary.\nOn behalf of that people, I should like to state before the Assembly that we have rejoiced in the end of the cold war, from which no country on Earth has been free. Every country has been a victim of its consequences, for in many areas of the world, that war became a bloody battle that has brought sorrow and mourning to thousands of homes in the second half of the century. That is true of my beloved Guatemala.\nAllow me, Sir, on behalf of the people and the Government of Guatemala to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session and to pledge the Guatemalan delegation's fullest cooperation. He are confident that your experience in the areas that are the responsibility of the United Nations will be crucial in achieving agreements that will be of benefit to the international community as a whole.\nAllow me, at the same time, to congratulate Ambassador Guido de Marco for the very efficient work he carried out as President of the previous session.\nI wish also to pay a most particular tribute to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, a distinguished son of Latin America, who has guided the work of the Organization for the last 10 years. We are all aware of his tireless endeavours to promote peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes. This dear friend of ours has given a fresh impetus to this world Organization as a centre for negotiation and the settlement of political problems, as reflected in the expansion of peace-keeping operations. He has repeatedly called attention to the economic, social and political problems that affect the entire world, particularly the developing countries. This has lent increasing credibility to multilateralism and, in particular, to the United Nations itself. His activities in Central America, together with those of the regional organization, have been invaluable in support of dialogue and negotiation as means of putting an end to regional tensions and domestic conflicts.\nI am gratified to see that the United Nations today has been strengthened by the entry of new Members. We extend the warmest welcome to the Republic of Korea, with which we have long-standing ties of friendship and cooperation; to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; to the Federated States of Micronesia; and to the Marshall Islands. Moreover, we are pleased to greet in this forum the independent nations of the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We hope that their recent independence will bring well-being and prosperity to their peoples. Guatemala extends to them its friendship, respect and understanding.\nWe are aware that a new international political reality has emerged, one that, we trust, will also be reflected in a new economic and social reality. We firmly believe that a new order is now dawning which, we hope, will not be based on arrogance and the abuse of power, but rather on the established principles of international law, the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention, taking these principles in the broad sense, not as indifference or isolation of one nation's realities from another, but as a new expression of solidarity among the peoples and nations of the world. In other words, whatever this order may be that is now being developed, it must have as its overriding objective the avoidance of the outbreak of fresh conflicts, such as may be inherent in a North-South confrontation, which can only be avoided through understanding and support from those who have more and can do more for those who have less and can do less.\nWe also believe that all the leaders of the world may finally understand once and for all that freedom and dignity are not abstract concepts or gifts from States to individuals or nations. Rather, both of these concepts are innate in human beings, and no dictatorship thus far, whatever its shape or political persuasion, has been able to inculcate in individuals or nations the meaning of those two noble aspirations.\nWe recognize that to date mankind has found in pluralist, representative and participatory democracy the system that best guarantees dignity and freedom to the individual and thus respect for all his rights, which are fully established in universal declarations emanating both from this Organization and from others that have shown constant concern for his full development and assumed responsibility for taking an active part in the ongoing processes of establishing the legitimacy of national States and regulating the relationships among them.\nMow more than ever, the United Nations is shouldering the great responsibility of realistically seeking practical solutions making it possible for the peoples of the world to develop and consolidate their independence and satisfy their aspirations for progress and development as solid bases for peace for many generations to come. These aspirations have been expressed in the Organisation since its very inception, since the Tehran Conference, when an anguished world was seeking an answer to war and was more than ever aware of the need to work for international peace and security.\nHowever, despite the Organization's considerable efforts, the generations of the post-war era have been beset by many national and international conflicts.\nAt the present time, we hail events and trends, such as the end of the cold war, political solutions to regional conflicts, the consolidation of democratic processes and the progressive development of market economies - all of which represent new possibilities for the promotion of peace and the well-being of mankind.\nWe believe that the new political climate in relations between important blocs, which until recently were adversaries, has had constructive effects in the world and enables us to define a broader and more fully integrated dimension of international security. This is the time for the traditional concept of security to be superseded, and for the promotion of political, economic and social conditions that will reduce the risk of confrontation and guarantee peace and economic and social stability everywhere to be embraced.\nIn the economic field, it is necessary that adjustment policies and policies of transition to market economies in the developing countries lead to the promotion of genuinely free trade, without protectionism, involving the major production sectors in the developed countries. A new international order requires us not to continue the contradiction between the growing accession of developing countries to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the resistance of the developed countries to submit to GATT procedures.\nInternational trade continues to stagnate, because it is bogged down by protectionist measures that impose restrictions on access to the developed countries' markets, by the production and export of subsidized products and by the imposition of quotas and price fixing. That is why the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development must identify the policies that need to be followed in future in the light of the developing countries' expectations.\nHence it is necessary for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at its eighth session to define the policies that need to be followed in the future in the light of the expectations of the developing countries.\nIn the social area, the new international agenda must necessarily include intensive discussion of means to promote social development, without which there can be no peace or well-being for mankind. We therefore support the holding of the world summit on social development proposed by President Aylwin of Chile. Clearly, the political progress that we are now witnessing is not being accompanied by social progress, which would offset the very heavy cost of the deterioration of the quality of life in the developing countries.\nIt is also imperative for the United Nations and the international community to continue the vital task of halting the arms race, in particular in the nuclear, chemical and biological fields and, indeed, in any field which involves mass destruction and for them to endeavour to utilize the tremendous investment involved for the purposes of economic and social development for human beings and for their well-being in general.\nAllow me now to share with all the peoples represented here some aspects of our national life and of the Government which I have presided over for the last eight months - to share with you some achievements and concerns, some aspirations and results. I am sure that from a knowledge of our experience there will come stronger links of solidarity and understanding between our peoples.\nFor more than 30 years, we in Guatemala have been faring a domestic struggle which has placed limits on our possibilities for development and has brought mourning and sorrow to our people. Today, I am gratified to inform the General Assembly that on 9 April - only three months after taking office - I put before the whole nation a comprehensive peace initiative, with a view to finding a course of action which, without any discrimination whatsoever, could unite Guatemalans in a common project which would enable us as a people to realise our potential to the full.\nThis initiative is based on the concept that peace is not simply the absence of war or of conflict, but that peace should be envisioned as a state that enables people to live and develop without fear, without anguish and without threats, free from persecution, free from anything which might limit them in achieving the objectives that they may set themselves within their own capacities.\nThis initiative, which seeks to achieve total and lasting peace, in addition to seeking the end of the armed struggle, also seeks to lay the basis for reconciliation and harmonious coexistence within the Guatemalan family on the basis of four essential points.\nFirst, termination of the armed struggle through serious negotiations which would set up programmes and procedures that would make it possible to put an end to the insurgency and the counter-insurgency, and at the same time promote ways of ensuring full respect for human rights, so that every Guatemalan, whether part of the insurgency or not, may fully enjoy the rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic and receive the appropriate safeguards that will enable him to develop his political capacity in a spirit of respect and freedom. We believe that this first step is fundamental in order to guarantee to those populations displaced by violence - both refugees and displaced persons - the necessary social, economic and political security to enable them to be legally reintegrated into the life of the country.\nSecondly, there must be greater economic and social equity. We recognize the need to strengthen and broaden all public and private programmes designed to combat extreme poverty and destitution, to speed up the modernization of our economy and to find viable and prompt solutions to the problems of education, health and social assistance and insurance because what we are spending now in maintaining the conflict, is money that our people urgently needs in order to solve its problems. Social and economic peace is a basic condition for the enjoyment of total peace.\nThirdly, there must be respect for, and strengthening of the rule of law. This element constitutes one of the greatest challenges facing our society, which has suffered for years under a dictatorship and autocracy, and in which there is a vital need to eliminate, once and for all, impunity as a regular procedure and to establish the rule of law and respect for human rights. This presents us with a great challenge - the need to strengthen monetary control, to increase professional training and reform our civil policies and, above all, the need to improve judicial procedures involved in the administration of justice.\nFourthly, there needs to be an expansion of the democratic process. We have made substantial progress in improving the country's democratic institutions and in strengthening the political system as a form of social coexistence. However, there is a need to continue to improve political and social institutions so as to enable the people to organize, in an informed manner, and to participate freely in an ongoing decision-making process taking into account the characteristics of our various cultural differences.  Fortunately, the whole peace initiative embodied in these four points has received a positive national response as well as international recognition. We have taken basic steps towards ensuring that, as we optimistically hope, we can face the challenge of changing the course of our history and replacing a culture of war by a culture of peace, justice and freedom.\nOur efforts have taken concrete shape in the form of a direct dialogue between the Government of the Republic and the insurgency forces, which has already yielded its first fruits in the various meetings that have already been held. After 30 years of confrontation, dialogue has finally begun and offers the hope that the guns may fall silent and ideas at long last be heard.\nAs a matter of elementary justice, I should like to acknowledge the valiant and steady efforts which the National Commission for the Reconciliation of Guatemala devoted to the peace process and the prudent and constructive role played by the United Nations in monitoring the process, which will, we hope - after the final agreement is signed - very soon evolve into an important function of verifying compliance with the agreement.\nIn the quest for social understandings, the Government of the Republic has drawn up a social compact in which business, labour and cooperative sectors participated and - despite the vicissitudes that it has faced - this process has yielded results which have served to establish fundamental national agreements and to secure the economic and social equity to which we have referred.\nIn the field of human rights, we are now waging an outright struggle against impunity, introducing substantial reforms in our juridical system and judicial procedures. At the same time, within the existing systems, we have taken firm action to punish violations. This is beginning to invert the trends of the past and allows us to look forward with optimism to the possibility of establishing a regime of trust in the country.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express my Government's satisfaction at the understanding that we have met with in this field from the international community, which has encouraged us in our efforts by its attitude of assistance and cooperation, which is resulting in the strengthening of national institutions responsible for ensuring compliance with the law and respect for human rights. I should like here to make special mention of the advice and services that we have received in this area from the United Nations. My Government considers this to be of such vital importance that, since we took office eight months ago, we have paid special attention to each and every one of the recommendations made to us by the expert adviser, Mr. Christian Tomuschat, whose guidance was so timely and useful. I could not fall on this occasion to refer to an aspect that is an integral part of the policies of our Government, which seeks to ensure that indigenous communities in Guatemala have enjoyment of their rights and are adequately guaranteed opportunities which the Constitution of the Republic grants to all Guatemalans, without any discrimination. These policies are specifically directed towards recognizing and protecting the integrity of the social values, practice and cultural identity of the Maya peoples and towards respectfully and objectively supporting the processes of change within these cultures themselves, including the strengthening and development of substantive juridical provisions which are proper to those communities and which recognize their traditional modes of life in the ways in which they are organized and in which they resolve conflicts among them.\nIt is a fundamental aspiration of my Government to ensure better political participation by the indigenous peoples at all levels, particularly at the local, grassroots, municipal and regional levels. We are in the course of completing consultations with the various Maya ethnic groups with a view to the ratification of Agreement 169, on indigenous and tribal peoples in independent countries, adopted by the International Labour Organisation. This Agreement includes fundamental elements of legal trusteeship which, together with the provisions of domestic law, will provide greater protection to the indigenous peoples for their conditions of employment.\nIn addition to the social and economic problems facing the country, we are now seeing an accelerated depletion of our natural resources, a large part of which are used by the majority sectors of our population to meet, among other things, its basic energy needs. This process of depletion and neglect has systematically worsened the environmental situation and may in a few years lead us towards an ecological crisis that will affect not only our country but the ecological systems of the world, especially because of its impact on the Maya biosphere some.\nFrom this rostrum I appeal for international solidarity to provide support for the specific policies we have been promoting, designed to make adequate, economic protection of our environment compatible with rational exploitation of our natural resources.\nThere is another matter of great concern that must be added to our traditional problems - namely, drugs and drug trafficking, which have rapidly taken on such proportions that they threaten the very essence of the democratic State; indeed, the tremendous amounts of money generated by that trade lead to the corruption of institutions in such small and fragile economies as ours. In this field, when national efforts are patently insufficient, it is not enough just to raise the conscience of the individual citizen; international cooperation is also needed, precisely because drug trafficking takes advantage of the great international imbalances and the poverty of regions where drugs have taken hold.\nOur State has been exerting great efforts to combat drug trafficking. It has undertaken legislative reforms to secure better tools to fight this scourge; important bilateral and multilateral agreements of cooperation have been signed. In addition, it has strictly applied the international treaties to which it has subscribed in order to combat drug trafficking. This endeavour demonstrates our people's real concern over the scourge of drug consumption, especially in the developed countries, and particularly among the young people. This is an example of the universal solidarity that should exist among all peoples of the world.\nIn this context, our Government also expresses its concern over the situation of orphans and destitute and homeless children and appeals for international cooperation to ensure that the rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child are truly put into effect in all countries. Guatemala has embarked on its own path in this respect and is pooling its efforts with those of national and international organisations, both public and private, in order to provide for the well-being of children and the future they deserve.\nIn another area, our Government has established a clear policy of rapprochement and integration with other countries. In this respect I should like to express our satisfaction at the reincorporation of Honduras in the framework Treaty of Central American economic integration and at the genuine possibility of expanding the Central America of Five to a Central America of Seven, with the inclusion of Panama and Belize. Substantial steps have been taken towards our ultimate goal. We have already signed wide-ranging agreements on free trade with El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and Colombia, and we hope that in the near future we shall be able to expand similar relations with other countries of the region.\nI should like to conclude this statement with the following, which, for my Government, represents an act of faith in the international community and in fundamental human rights and also clear testimony to our unswerving dedication to peace: Guatemala, in conformity with its policy of respect for human rights in all areas, has taken the fundamental step of expressly recognizing, in strict adherence to international law, the right to self-determination of the people of Belize, thus opening the way to the final ending of a conflict that in its last phase dates back to 1859. This step has been documented in the Treaty on frontiers signed by the State of Guatemala and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We hope that the Guatemalan decision in this matter will be appreciated in all its\ndimensions by the international community, because of its importance both for our country and for the peace of the region as a whole, and that the international community will support us in our endeavour to ensure that this persistent conflict is resolved within the framework of international law. Recognition of the State of Belize and the establishment of diplomatic relations will enable us to settle the dispute in a civilized way. I would, however, make it clear that this territorial dispute, which still exists, should not in any way constitute an obstacle to harmony and rapprochement between our peoples or to the cooperation and mutual support that should prevail between the two nations.\nFinally, I should like to place it on record, before the eyes of the world, that Guatemala will firmly and resolutely support, regardless of what it may cost us, any initiative that will promote the process of peace in any region of the world where it may be necessary. For, to quote the Gospel,\n\\\"Blessed be the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God\\\", (The Holy Bible. Matthew 5:9) Blessed, therefore, be this Organization, which has striven, is striving and will continue to strive to achieve peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my pleasure to convey to you, Mr. President, on my own behalf and on that of my Government, our warm congratulations on your election to preside over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which brings us together to discuss all international and regional issues that are of concern to all the international community. You, Sir, are a highly experienced diplomat who has served the Organisation for many years. Ma have known you as a friend to all and as a brother from a fraternal country to which we are bound by ties of blood and the Islamic religion as well as by a common culture.\n\nAbove all, we have known you to be a courageous and experienced diplomat in dealing with many of the intractable questions addressed by the Organization over the years. We congratulate you on your accession to this high post and we have full confidence that you will conduct the deliberations of this session in an exemplary manner.\nI also wish to express the deep appreciation of my delegation to your predecessor, Ambassador Guido de Marco, the Foreign Minister of Malta, who conducted the affairs of the last session with wisdom and efficiency.\nWe also renew our thanks to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his outstanding efforts in consolidating the foundations of international peace and security in a difficult year that witnessed the eruption of thorny problems which threatened to undermine international and regional peace and security.\nIt is also my pleasure to express the happiness of my delegation at the accession to the membership of the United Nations by the Republic of Korea and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. We hope that this positive tendency will lead to further efforts to unify peacefully and through negotiations the two Koreas with a view to achieving stability, security and prosperity in the region.\nWe also express our happiness at the accession to the membership of the United Nations by the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the three Baltic Republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. We are confident that with the accession of this group of friendly nations, the Charter of the United Nations is entering nowadays upon a new era and is being rejuvenated. The events in East; Europe have highlighted the sanctity of two of the principal foundations of the United Nations Charter, namely, the right of self-determination and respect for human rights wherever man may live. \nAt the beginning of this session, we must pause and consider what happened at the last session, namely, the tendencies that prevailed in that session and the effects they had on the deliberations that took place in the General Assembly, its Main Committees and subsidiary bodies.\nWe believe that the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly was one of the most important in the history of this Organization. That session witnessed the postulation, for the first time, of the so-called new world order. This, in our view, means the radical reconsideration of the relationships that used to prevail in the world on all the strategic, military, economic, social and human levels. In other words, this means that the international community is at the threshold of a new phase in the history of humanity in the course of which many of the concepts that used to prevail in the past will be changed. We do hope that that change will be positive and imbued with lofty humanist ideals like the prevalence of justice for all, the application of one standard to all, and the preservation of the human dignity of all peoples, by allowing them to exercise their right to self-determination and refraining from interfering in their internal affairs. Above all, this Organization should be enabled to play a constructive and positive role and should not be used as a mount to achieve the narrow interests of any one nation or group of nations and should not be driven away from its principles and objectives which ensure justice for all.\nThe establishment of a new world order should not be the exclusive prerogative of the developed and militarily strong countries. It is a major transformation in which every nation should take part, in the interest of the small countries. The destiny of the world should not be shaped by an elite group of States which enjoy having great economic, industrial, technical and military power. We should not revert to the days of old colonialism, no matter how it may change its skin, or its techniques in imposing its influence on others. In the contemporary concept, we are all partners that bear a shared duty and a common responsibility to enable future generations to lead a decent life and to enjoy the fruits of human creativity and the blessings of an advanced civilization, whose goal is the happiness of mankind and not its continued material and spiritual wretchedness.\nOn the basis of the foregoing we call for enlarging the permanent membership of the Security Council, with members of the non-aligned countries being given a place by rotation. In that way, this important group of nations will be able to take part in the preparation of resolutions which have a bearing on international peace and security. He call for this as we are convinced that the Non-Aligned Movement has become more important to its members than ever before in view of the rapid changes that are sweeping over the world these days and the talk in international forums regarding the emergence of a new world order that does not seem to pay sufficient attention to the interests of the small countries.\nIn this respect, we cannot but express the hope that, this time, the post of Secretary-General will be given to one of the sons of Africa. This would demonstrate the international community's respect for and confidence in the African continent and its devoted sons, many of whom have exerted great efforts towards preserving international peace and security.\nWe hope that this session will be inspired by this constructive spirit in pursuing its work and shouldering its responsibilities. This would emphasize the partnership of the entire international community as a whole in shaping a better future for future generations. We hope that this session will thus enhance the importance of the United Nations and make it the main fulcrum that shapes the destiny of the world.\nA few months ago, Sudan celebrated the second anniversary of its National Salvation Revolution. In those two years, Sudan has witnessed radical transformations which have helped the country to break out from the sphere of the old power-hungry forces and their strife. The revolution continues its determined march towards building a new society, enhancing national unity, and expanding and stabilizing the democratic process through consultation and dialogue. The revolution is moving resolutely towards power sharing and wealth distribution after the application of the federal system to the provinces. We hope very soon to establish the constituent national congress. We have already made adequate preparations for that congress and have organised a conference in which all parties participated in order to eliminate the problems that were left behind by previous regimes. These problems will be dealt with on a sound basis.\nThe overriding concern of our revolution is to bring about peace to all parts of the country. My country has witnessed an armed conflict that was imposed on it after it gained its independence in 1956. Therefore, the revolution, from day one, made a point of establishing contact and is still in contact with the rebel leaders. At present, we maintain high-level contacts through the good offices of Mr. Ibrahim Babangida, the President of the Republic of Nigeria, in his capacity as the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), with the aim of ironing out the differences between fellow countrymen in a spirit of African fellowship.\nWhile thanking Mr. Babangida from this rostrum, we wish him every success in his good offices. He also call upon the rebel leaders to heed the voice of reason and the mother country and desist from being tools in the hands of foreign Powers so as to spare the people of Sudan and further suffering. He should work hand in hand to develop every part of the country and ensure its progress on the economic, social and human levels.\nThe central Government in Khartoum is quite prepared, at all times, to negotiate in good faith and put an end to this conflict which has bled the country for long enough. The only way to do this is to adhere to the spirit of the Conference of National Dialogue on Peace Issues, which convened in Khartoum in September of 1989.\nHere we should point out that the recent developments in Ethiopia have led to positive tendencies which must reflect favourably on the prospects of peace in Sudan, and bring it nearer than ever before. However, this can only happen through concerted efforts and sincere intentions.\nThis year has witnessed rapid, dramatic international and regional changes which have amazed many and put paid to many of the theories and strategies which prevailed in the past. As I said before, we are now at the threshold of a new era in the history of the world.\nIn the Arab region, there has been the Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute and the resultant war that devastated the resources and capabilities of two sister States. This war opened wide the doors of the region to foreign intervention and paved the way for ushering in the so-called new world order, which we hope will not be applied selectively to certain peoples and Governments while others are left outside the realm of international laws and norms which they flout continuously. Indeed, we cannot understand why the new world order should mean, for example, the continued imposition of sanctions against Iraq, and the consequent continued deprivation of its people, its children, women and elderly citizens, of food and medicine. We cannot understand how a new world order could be ushered in through the total destruction of Iraq's infrastructures and the prevention of that country from enjoying its national wealth through a system of unfair and harsh control.\nIn the Horn of Africa, many developments have taken place and resulted in the uprooting of obsolete tribal regimes that had sold out to foreign Powers and betrayed the aspirations of their own peoples. Those major developments, which shook the region, were bound to have certain negative effects: such as the refugee problem, widespread suffering and the displacement of populations. However, these phenomena should not last forever.\nFrom this rostrum, we congratulate the Ethiopian people on their admirable national achievement and assure them that we will always extend a helping hand in their march towards attaining their aspirations.\nAs for the developments in Somalia, we hastened, in cooperation with other sister States to do all we could to end the dispute there, in order to enable the Somali people to preserve their national identity and territorial integrity without leaving a loophole for any harmful foreign interference. We are fully confident that the people of the sister country of Somalia will be able to solve their own problems with wisdom and solidarity.\nGiven our keen interest in preserving the security of the region and ensuring the welfare of its peoples, we are intent on encouraging and enhancing dialogue between the countries of the region through regional and bilateral channels in order to improve the chances of peace and make optimum use of our material and human resources. The cancellation of visa requirements between Ethiopia and Sudan was meant to intensify exchanges for the mutual benefit of both countries.\nThe ongoing developments in Central and Eastern Europe are conclusive proof that peoples' aspirations and their desire to safeguard their traditions and human values should be respected. Such aspirations cannot be suppressed by the force of arms or by subjugation to theories and regimes that are dictated from the top and which are divorced from reality. Freedom is not divisible and people's capabilities should not be wasted in running after slogans that are divorced from human nature.\nWe sincerely hope that the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe will be able to solve their pending problems, through constructive dialogue, and preserve their economic, social and human achievements. We also hope that that region will remain, as ever, a safety valve that preserves international peace and security and the champion and friend of the small and developing countries that aspire to achieve their economic and social development without any unfair diktat, domination or spheres of influence.\nIn the same vein, we hope that the people of South Africa will realize all their aspirations after political equality and social and economic justice. Therefore, we still adhere to the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa (resolution S-16/1) of 1989, and call for its full implementation together with its programme of action, in order to end apartheid.\nConsequently, we believe that the lifting of all sanctions and boycotts against the Government of South Africa should be reviewed and dealt with cautiously, despite the promises made by the Government of South Africa and the steps taken by that Government towards the abrogation of apartheid laws. In the end, we hope to see the black and coloured people of South Africa enjoying all the privileges enjoyed in that part of the African continent.\nMention should be made here of the importance of the tripartite agreement signed recently between the leaders of the African National Congress, the Inkatha Movement and the Government of South Africa in order to end the violence in that part of the continent.\nWe have spoken about the right of peoples to self-determination and their right to preserve their heritage and human achievements. This leads us to the tragedy of the age, namely, the tragedy of the Palestinian people, who have been dispossessed and driven out of their lands and subjected to all kinds of repression and brutality by the occupying Power, Israel.\nThe question of Palestine has been and still is a severe test for the international community and the credibility of its organizations. For more than 40 years the Palestinian people have been subjected to the most brutal forms of occupation and oppression. Every single day, their human rights are being violated by the Zionist regime.\nFurthermore, the Israeli tax policy imposed on the occupied Arab territories, since 1967, is contrary to all international laws and conventions both in its assessment and methods of collection. That tax system is one of the harshest measures of collective punishment. Its measures are decreed by the military authorities. They are based on exaggerated arbitrary assessments of tax liabilities and are implemented under the guise of a tax-collection system that is enforced, most aggressively and arbitrarily, by the army, security forces, customs authorities and military courts.\nIt is evident that the escalation of this type of repression through taxation is a further attempt by the authorities of occupation to blackmail the Palestinians, to wear them down, weaken their ability to make savings, deprive them of the means of livelihood and pre-empt any possibility of their building an independent national economy. It is also meant to tighten the noose further with the aim of breaking the spirit at their intifadah and forcing them to surrender or leave the country. Despite all this, the Palestinian people have shown great courage and heroism. The children of the intifadeh are still being martyred daily.\nPeace and security will not be brought to the Middle East unless and until Israel withdraws from the occupied Arab territories, and unless and until the Palestinians achieve their full and undiminished rights, the foremost of which is the establishment of their own national State, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Meanwhile, the PLO has continued to adopt a positive and constructive stand from which it took many a positive and constructive initiative with the aim of achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the area.\nDespite all this, the entire international community can testify to the obduracy of Israel in continuing its occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon. Israel continues to bring in tens of thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants and continues to build settlements in the occupied territories. It continues to obstruct by every means the convening of the peace conference. It does so by imposing preconditions, preventing the Palestinians from taking their rightful place in the peace process and marginalizing the role of the United Nations, in naked defiance of international legality.\nWe strongly support all the sincere efforts being made to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East to be held on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and from this rostrum we call upon the permanent members of the Security Council to force Israel to come to the negotiating table without arrogance or prevarication.\nEight must be upheld. Just as the international community implemented fully every single resolution adopted by the Security Council in the context of the new world order, we look forward to the same zeal in applying the same standards in the case of Israel which has uprooted the Palestinian people, usurped their land and violated every international norm and law.\nShall we keep silent forever? Shall we close our eyes forever? How long will favouritism continue at the expense of others? From this rostrum, we support the latest resolutions adopted by the PLO in Algeria. We do hope that the United States of America, the Soviet Union and all the other interested countries will be able to make a success of the forthcoming peace conference, and thereby restore the full rights of the Palestinian people and neighbouring Arab countries and re-establish peace, stability and security in the region.\nOther international and regional issues are still in abeyance. The situation in Afghanistan is still unsettled. We still hope for a broad-based Government and for the noble Mujahideen to unite, frustrate all foreign conspiracies and thereby enable the Afghani people to choose freely the political and social system they wish to live under.\nIn Cambodia, we hope that the spirit of Jakarta will prevail and enable the Supreme National Council, headed by Prince Sihanouk, with the help of the United Nations, to bring about a lasting and comprehensive political settlement.\nMy country takes great interest in the problem of the environment, in view of its close links with development. We wish to voice our deep concern at the deterioration of the environment in many areas. We refer especially to the depletion of the ozone layer, the unsettled climatic conditions which prevail in the world, drought, desertification, other natural disasters, the poisons released into the atmosphere by certain industries in some developed countries and the resultant damage to agriculture and development. We pin great hopes on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development scheduled to take place in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We hope the Conference will achieve concrete results that would lead to the preservation of the environment and indeed of human life. We in Sudan have established a national committee to prepare for the conference and to participate effectively in its deliberations.\nAt the economic level, the deterioration of the economies of the African continent has reached a critical stage. The important changes that have taken place in international relations have not led to a parallel detente in international economic relations. We know that the poor countries still suffer from their usual problems of indebtedness, adverse trade conditions and sluggish economic development. Africa has suffered one natural disaster after the other over the past few years. Those continuing national disasters have led to a severe plunge in its export revenues at a time when the continent stands in dire need of the resources required to finance imports whose prices have been inflated. Unless and until the terms of trade improve in a fair and equitable manner, the economic situation of the African countries will deteriorate further as most of them have to earmark about 90 per cent of their export earnings to finance the importation of absolute necessities at the expense of their ability to invest in development projects.\nThe debt burden has plagued both developing and developed countries alike, and has had a very negative effect on the development efforts of the developing countries. Foreign debts continue to swallow up most or even all of the revenues of those countries in many cases. Five years have passed since the United Nations adopted the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.\nWe now notice that the African countries have adopted the required policies and taken the necessary measures to make structural changes, despite the heavy social and political cost involved. However, the requirements of economic reform are not confined to austerity measures and structural reforms. It also requires financial inflows that measure up to the size of the problem.\nMy delegation is in complete agreement with the final review and appraisal of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Following the failure of the said programme, we call for the adoption of the proposal with regard to the implementation of the international agenda on cooperation with Africa in the 1990s. We also hope the current negotiations in Uruguay will succeed.\nThe Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries was held last year in an atmosphere of understanding and resolve to cooperate with those countries and assist them in overcoming their economic troubles through the implementation of the programme for revitalizing their economic development. The programme is based on a sound and comprehensive scientific understanding of the problems involved. All parties should be committed to participate in its implementation.\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Paris Declaration and calls upon on the least developed countries, the international community and the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UHCTAD) to play their full and positive roles in the implementation of the programme of action on the basis of shared responsibility and the consensus reached at that Conference.\nMy delegation would like to commend the programme for special economic and disaster relief assistance. The United Nations has contributed, through the assistance given by the donor countries and various organizations, in relief operations. In Sudan, the international community, as represented by the donor countries and organizations, has continued to play its humanitarian role in relief operations in some parts of the country, as well as for those who were uprooted and forced to leave their homes. In this respect, I can only hail the resolution adopted by the General Assembly in its last session with regard to the third phase of Operation Lifeline Sudan.\nMention should be made also of the visit to Khartoum by Mr. James Ingram, Executive Director of the World Food Programme and of the subsequent visits to Khartoum and Nairobi by Mr. James Jonah, Under-Secretary-General, Department for Special Political Questions. The purpose of those visits was to provide foodstuffs to the area of A1-Nasser and the Sudanese nationals who had returned to it after the collapse of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia.\nThe Government of Sudan has shown its readiness to enable the World Food Programme, international and non-governmental organizations and donor countries to provide that aid on humanitarian grounds, despite the fact that most of those returnees still carry arms against the State of Sudan.\nThe rebel movement still holds tens of thousands of children in camps with a view to training them to carry and use arms and uses them in transporting munitions and materiel in complete disregard of the repeated appeals by the international community. We must point out here the dangerous nature of such practices which should be unmasked so that the international community may be made aware of the acts perpetrated by that rebel movement.\nThe Government of Sudan has expressed its willingness to assist in the relief operations and agreed to United Nations proposals on phase three of Operation Lifeline Sudan. Up to the present and regardless of the non-compliance of the other party, the Government of Sudan, given its responsibility towards its people, has responded, now as in the past, and met all the requirements for the successful implementation of that important humanitarian programme. This will continue to be its policy.\nWhile we welcome the report on the United Nations programme on emergency assistance in the Horn of Africa and commend the implementation of part of that programme, we call upon the donor countries and organizations to continue to finance the programme for the present and the coming year.\nWe must reiterate here the readiness of the Government of Sudan to discuss all questions of emergency relief with all the Governments concerned, but without compromising the sovereignty of our country which has always cooperated in showing respect for the dignity of the people of the Sudan. In this context, I must refer to the statement of the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, who spoke on behalf of the European Economic Community, in which he expressed concern about the economic and the human rights situation in Sudan. I would refer in this respect to what I have already said a few moments ago, namely that the Government of Sudan is eager to allow relief to reach all those who need it throughout Sudan. This is a fact that the United Nations officials attest to and it proves that what was said in the statement by the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands was without foundation and not supported by factual evidence.\nAs for the comments by the representative of the United Kingdom at the pledging conference for the Horn of Africa, specifically with respect to the Darfur area, I wish to state that the food situation there is good; it is just that the state lacks an adequate transportation network. We would refer in this respect to the huge project of rehabilitating the railroad sector under International Monetary Fund auspices which could have been carried out were it not for the obstacles that some of the donor countries continued to put in its way even after the contracts were signed. The same type of obstruction has impeded our efforts in the area of agricultural inputs. Notwithstanding, the allegation that half of Sudan's population will starve is not to be believed; it is groundless. I am pleased to say that such over-pessimistic predictions will not come true and are without basis. The people of Sudan are alive and well.\nWe also wish to point out that some of the donor countries whose voices have been the loudest in criticizing us are those who have donated least: their donations which do not exceed a thousand tons of food have not reached us to this date.\nThere are many other human and social issues of great importance which continue to be in abeyance and which call for lasting stable solutions. One of such issues is the question of political asylum, a negative phenomenon which has been before us since the Second World War and the hotbeds of tension and political and military conflict that that war spawned in many of the countries of the developing world. If certain political, economic, social and climatic circumstances have contributed in the past to the intensification of the phenomenon in Africa, recent developments in the Horn of Africa have caused huge numbers of refugees to flee to neighbouring countries. Sudan has had a large share of that tragedy. We have received tens of thousands of our brethren from Ethiopia. Despite our limited resources and despite the fact that we are accommodating tens of thousands of refugees, we have spared no effort to give them refuge. We have entered into an agreement with Ethiopia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on accommodating those refugees, which proves our good intentions with respect to permanent cooperation with all our neighbours.\nThat agreement is a sign of the importance we attach to humanitarian cooperation in several fields. We wish to thank the Government of Ethiopia, the UNHCR and all the States and economic groupings that have contributed to the success of this humanitarian effort. The status of refugee is ft blot on the dignity of man, and is an anachronism in an age when we have achieved great progress in other areas. We hope that Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will visit the Sudan to see first-hand the situation there rather than depending for information on certain donor countries and non-governmental organizations. That would block the way in the face of the current attempts at justifying interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States under the pretext of protecting human rights.\nHuman rights, the right to live in peace and security and enjoy unhampered economic, social and cultural progress, should be among and no less than any of the major questions on the international agenda, such as the questions of disarmament, the granting of independence to colonized countries, technology transfers and the establishment of an equitable international economic order. The best resource on Earth is man; man is God's guardian of the planet. Because of economic, strategic and social circumstances, millions suffer from starvation and ignorance and are prevented from exercising the right to self-determination. Many people cannot lead a decent life or practice their religion because of policies imposed upon them.\nThings that may be valid for one society do not necessarily apply in the case of another; every system of thought and value should spring from the society itself. It should not be imposed from outside. Sudan has been accused of certain human rights violations; we want to make the truth known. We have established positive relations with the Commission on Human Rights and reported to it fully on the human rights situation in Sudan. Though we believe that the decision reached by the Commission is neither fair nor objective we shall cooperate with it as we have nothing to hide. We are committed to all human rights conventions to which we are signatories.\nHow can Sudan be accused of human rights violations when we have in fact brought dignity to the people of Sudan? We have applied the law, and have created circumstances favourable to the application of the rule of law. We have released all political detainees and have demolished the largest of detention camps, that which the colonial power built in the heyday of empire.\nWe ask all our critics to hear us out, to listen to the testimony of parliamentarians and representatives of humanitarian groups and to be willing to see the facts. We are proud that for the first time in the history of armed conflict we applied the concept of the right of safe passage with a view to saving many lives. The world can also see that we contributed food and medicine to the victims of torture who have fled to Sudan after the recent developments in Ethiopia, even though most of them were up in arms against the country. Their own country.\nThe application of Islamic shariah in the Sudan does not deprive non-Muslims of their rights. Nor does it compromise the dignity of non-Muslims or prevent them from enjoying all their human rights. The application of the shariah system enables everyone to enjoy his rights and submit to the will of God.\nAt this very important juncture in human and world history, we express our conviction that the new world order should be based on justice, non-interference and respect for self-determination. This system should be the means to preserve the dignity of man and it should be done through the international Organisation because it is universal and the only body capable of preserving international peace and security. We will spare no effort in upholding this system which we await impatiently.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, you are presiding over this session at a very crucial time in the international arena. I should like to express my congratulations to you upon your election to the presidency and my full confidence that under your able guidance our deliberations will be crowned with success. To your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, let me convey my deepest appreciation for his remarkable performance during the course of the last session.\nMy congratulations are also extended to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the wise manner in which he ha3 presided over the destiny of our Organization in the search for solutions to political, economic and social problems around the world. We warmly welcome the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic of Lithuania, into the family of the United Nations. Their presence among us reinforces the universal character of our Organisation and stimulates the ideals of democracy, peace, justice and freedom embodied in the Charter.\nUntil very recently, the rifts between East and Heat had created a world characterised by a climate of tension, confrontation, mistrust and the psychosis of war in international relations. At present, however, we witness a world where the end of polarisation and confrontation, as a result of ideological differences between the super-Powers, opens up excellent opportunities for the international community to join efforts in the search for adequate solutions to the many challenges still facing mankind.\nThis situation is reflected in the ever-increasing role of the United Nations and the earnest participation of the Organisation in its efforts towards the consolidation of the climate of detente and dialogue prevailing at the present time.\nWe note with appreciation and renewed hope that the political understanding reached between the United States and the Soviet Union has already contributed, in a relatively short period of time, to a positive resolution of complex issues which for many years have been the bone of contention between the super-Powers - the very issues that had entailed negative and global repercussions in the international arena.\nWe are therefore convinced that this climate of understanding will contribute decisively to the exploration of new horizons in the search for solutions to the remaining international issues to which adequate responses are still lacking. We remain concerned with issues like the consolidation of International peace and security, the disarmament process, the external debt crisis and the question of the development and protection of the environment, the reinforcement and strengthening of democracy, the promotion of human rights, the phenomenon of refugees and displaced people, the combat against terrorism and illegal drug trafficking, among others.\nThe end of the East-West confrontation constitutes a good reason for celebration and reinvigoration for a generation which has lived facing the spectre of war. This achievement, however, is nothing but the first step on the long journey through the avenues of peace, cooperation, progress and prosperity, for which we all yearn. It is within this context that we follow with keen interest the ongoing efforts and initiatives towards the solution to several regional conflicts. In the Middle East, for instance, my Government encourages and supports the current initiatives for the convening of an international peace conference in the region. We also believe that similar efforts should be deployed towards finding an early solution to the conflicts in Western Sahara, Cambodia, Afghanistan, East Timor, and elsewhere where conflicts still prevail. The recent experience regarding the crisis in the Gulf demonstrated clearly that appropriate solutions to various problems affecting international peace and security in the world can be found. \nThe President of the Republic of Mozambique, Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, said in his address to the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly last year that cooperation, solidarity and the emerging of a new consensus at the international level constitute the most eloquent examples of the universal dimension of our Organization. He went on to say:\n\\\"It is our understanding that this new trend in International relations should not be an instrument for the management of selective crises, but a systematic policy to confront the countless challenges in the world ...\\\"(A/45/PV, 13, p, 53).  \nThe end of the cold war opens up good prospects for the countries of the North and the South to work together on a common agenda focused on the resolution of the pressing issues which affect developing nations. Let us take advantage of the present political situation to work out adequate solutions to the problems of hunger, ignorance, poverty and misery, which constitute potential sources of conflict in the developing nations. Delaying further the resolution of these issues can undermine the efforts towards the democratisation process currently under way in the developing world. It is our belief that one can hardly build a full democracy in a world in which 15 per cent of the population consumes 70 per cent of the total production, in a world where 1.5 billion people lack basic medical care and in which illiteracy levels are dramatically high, just to mention a few examples. \nWe therefore concur with the Secretary-General's evaluation, contained in his last report on United Nations activities, that the revitalisation of North-South dialogue has become more urgent than ever. It is our understanding that this dialogue must accord priority to the issue of external debt, the problems of the Uruguay Sound and the question of the transfer of financial and technological resources to developing nations.\nThe degradation of the environment and the ecological system has merited increased attention on the part of the international community. International cooperation in the search for global measures and policies on the subject can guarantee effective solutions to the problems of environment preservation. We are confident and duly optimistic about the success of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is due to take place in Brazil in June 1992. We hope that this historic conference will establish the foundations for fruitful cooperation between nations in the search for adequate global solutions to the environmental problems that threaten the survival of mankind. We hope that the Conference will reveal common attitudes to the responsibility and capability of each State, as well as to the different economic issues arising from the environment question.\nThe winds of change in southern Africa begin to offer renewed hope for a future of peace, democracy, social justice and progress in the region. On this occasion we wish to salute the efforts that culminated in the signing, in Portugal on 31 May 1991, of the Angola Peace Accords. The signing of these Accords represents the end of a protracted conflict, which sowed death and destruction in Angola for 17 years.\nThe Republic of Mozambique - indeed, the entire international community - follows developments in South Africa with the utmost interest. The process of removing the pillars of apartheid brings with it an atmosphere of hope, and it represents a significant political development in the context of the creation of a democratic state and non-racial society in 8outh Africa. However, these developments have not yet been accompanied by similar measures leading to the creation of an appropriate climate for the free exercise of political activity in that country. In the interests of peace and harmony between all South Africans, we address a renewed appeal to the South African Government to undertake its responsibility to put an end to the violence, which has intensified in recent months.\nIn our view the National Peace Accord of 14 September 1991, signed by the Government and the main political organizations in the country, constitutes a valuable instrument aimed at securing the cessation of violence and the creation of appropriate conditions for the free exercise of political activity in South Africa. To this end, we urge the people of South Africa in general to exercise acute vigilance with a view to neutralizing the actions of forces still in favour of the perpetuation of the apartheid system as a means of protecting their privileges, to the detriment of the welfare and reconciliation of South African society as a whole.\nThe political stability of a democratic and non-racial society in South Africa is vital if peace, stability, progress and cooperation are to be secured in the region. Confidence-building measures and collective-security mechanisms must be deployed in order to prevent the resurgence of new conflicts in the region.\nThe southern African region has enormous economic potential, the potential to become a viable regional market in the near future, with the prospect of growing to be a strong partner in its trade relations with other regions.\nThe war in Mozambique continues to be a matter of great concern to my Government. For more than a decade Mozambique has known no peace. This is the result of war that has been imposed on the country. Last year the President of the Republic of Mozambique had occasion to inform this Assembly of the beginning of direct negotiations in Rome between the Government and RENAMO. The end of violence, the establishment of peace and the normalization of life for all Mozambicans continue to be the Government's highest priority.\nThe Government agreed to engage in direct dialogue convinced that the other side was ready to accept a minimum number of basic principles. It is against this background that seven rounds of negotiations have taken place since July 1990. The negotiation process has been difficult and sluggish. In a total of seven rounds, only a partial cease-fire agreement for the Beira and Limpopo corridors has been concluded. Nevertheless, in terms of the viability of this agreement, the Joint Verification Commission, created at the onset of this partial agreement and comprising eight countries, has already had the opportunity to denounce several violations perpetrated by RENAMO in those corridors. These violations constitute deliberate action aimed at violating the letter and the spirit of the agreement.\nOn the other hand, after 16 years of full independence in Mozambique, RENAMO seeks to question the legitimacy of the State, the Government and its institutions. In addition to its being absurd, this posture constitutes a clear demonstration that the negotiation process continues to be jeopardized by external interference and by interests other than those of the Mozambican people. The immediate cessation of this interference is called for.\nApart from that, RENAMO continues its indiscriminate crusade of massacres against defenceless people and its systematic destruction of the country's economic and social infrastructures. In spite of this negative behaviour, the Government will continue to exercise the necessary tolerance and responsibility and will work tirelessly to bring the war in Mozambique to an end. We are currently engaged in efforts to convene the eighth round of negotiations. There have been many postponements, at the request of the other side. Session after session, it has been the position of the Government that the negotiating parties should proceed to the discussion of substantive issues, including agreement on a general cease-fire. Actually, there is no reason today for continuation of the war and violence in Mozambique. Indeed, I must say that the efforts to restore peace in Mozambique find today an auspicious political atmosphere.\nA new Constitution of the Republic entered into force last November. This embodies the principle of democratic pluralism and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and association. In this context, the Political Parties Act establishes a legal platform for the activities of political parties. Meanwhile, we are preparing an electoral law that will govern both the legislative and the presidential elections planned for 1992. It gives me great pleasure to inform this Assembly that we shall welcome international observers to this process.\nHaving said this, I should like to reiterate that there is no justification whatsoever for the continuation of the war in Mozambique. In fact, all political forces in the country, including RENAMO, may pursue or defend their political objectives and strive to accede to power through the popular ballot, without having to resort to violence. \nIn the economic field, the implementation of the programme of economic and social recovery suffers from the direct affects of unfavourable international conditions, which are reflected in the curtailment of economic relations with some of our traditional partners and in rising oil prices on the international market. \nThis situation demanded that the Government adopt drastic austerity measures. However, despite the effects of the war and other economic constraints, economic growth levels continued to be positive in 1990, although last year's growth rate was relatively low compared to levels between 1987 and 1989, when annual growth averaged 5 per cent. The main constraint on economic and social development continues to be the acts of armed destabilization and the resulting social instability. As a result, thousands of peasants continue to be forced to abandon their places of origin and seek refuge in distant lands. This aggravates the emergency and hinders the development of the rural economy, which can no longer respond adequately to the economic incentives provided by the Government.\nThe Republic of Mozambique wishes to take this opportunity to express its high regard for, and gratitude to the international community for the emergency assistance and humanitarian aid it has accorded to the affected populations, both within and outside the country, in response to the appeals of the Government and of the Secretary-General. It is, however, a matter of fact that, even with the end of the war and the restoration of peace in Mozambique, the country's needs for humanitarian, technical and financial assistance will certainly increase.\nThe normalization of life, the social rehabilitation of children and adults traumatized by the war, the reconstruction and revitalization of the economy and social infrastructures, thus securing the development of the country, will require an enormous flow of financial and technical resources, requiring timely planning. At national level, the Government has already set up a special commission for the preparation and coordination of the plan for national reconstruction and resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons. For this, given the present situation, the country will also need to rely on the valuable assistance of the international community, which will be indispensable in our efforts for national reconstruction in the post-war\nperiod.\nMore than ever we trust in the ability and potential of the United Nations to serve as an ideal and privileged forum for the harmonization of the global interests of all nations of the world. We hope that the ongoing positive political change in international relations will be the catalyst for shaping a new world of peace, prosperity and cooperation among nations. As representatives of a peace-loving nation which has experienced the horrors of war, we look to the future with renewed optimism.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, at the outset I take pleasure in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. This election is a token of appreciation both to your person and to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which is a founding Member of this world Organization and continued to be a fervent supporter of its objectives. The role that the Kingdom plays in the area of Arab and Islamic affairs, being the host country to the Secretariat of the Islamic Conference Organization and the Secretariat of the Gulf Cooperation Council, are indications of the significance of your having been elected to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your leadership of this session will effectively contribute to the realisation of the goals to which the international community is looking forward.\nI take pleasure, too, in commending Mr. Guido de Marco, the President of the forty-fifth session, for the efficient manner, the capability and wisdom with which he conducted the affairs of that session. I should also like to express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his unstinting efforts to achieve peace, security and the well-being of all the peoples of the world under difficult international conditions.\nIt is only fair to record here that the Secretary-General has striven earnestly to restore to the Organization its credibility and effectiveness in its role as the guarantor of international peace and security.\nMy delegation welcomes the admission to membership of the Organization of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. We hope that their accession to the membership of the United Nations will contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of the world body.\nThe work of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is being conducted in a new international climate in which the credibility of the United Nations in dealing with crises and conflicts which threaten peace and security has been enhanced. This in turn has led to confirming the faith of the peoples of the world in the importance of the world body and the effectiveness of its role in preserving the peace and security of the world.\nThis development was particularly evident during the Gulf crisis, in which the world Organization undertook the most decisive role, which resulted in reversing aggression and returning legitimacy to the sister State of Kuwait under the relevant Security Council resolutions. The fact that the permanent Members of the Security Council acted unanimously to reverse aggression restored to the Council the fullness of its authority in preserving world peace and security. This development presages a new era in international relations and a continued effective role for the Security Council, thanks to the concord between the great Powers.\nThe responsibility for removing the remaining hotbeds of tension and conflict in the many parts of the world is that of the Security Council. It is highly desirable that the Council should persevere along the lines of its action in response to the Gulf war and resolve with the same positive approach the remaining international problems, foremost among which is that of Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict which has continued for far too long and which can be settled fairly and justly through the application of the principles of the Charter and the relevant resolutions in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). As far as we are concerned, the Palestinian cause is at the forefront of our preoccupations. This problem cannot be resolved without recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Similarly, the Security Council is called upon to implement its resolution 425 (1978), which called upon Israel to withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory.\nWe are fully confident that the Security Council has every intention of fully implementing all its resolutions with regard to the Middle East conflict, the Gulf conflict and other problems of the world in the same determined spirit which characterized the implementation of its resolutions on the Iraqi act of aggression against the State of Kuwait.\nThe events of August of last year confronted the Arab States of the Gulf region with their collective responsibility to preserve peace there and to ensure their territorial integrity. Those States have determined unanimously to work out, in participation with some other Arab and friendly nations.\nsecurity arrangements that would ensure the non-recurrence of what happened last year.\nMy country welcomes the serious and untiring efforts of the United States of America to reach a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. We command the joint call of the United States and the Soviet Union to convene a peace conference on the Middle East. He look forward to the convening of that conference on time and to its success in establishing in the region a stable peace based on justice and equal treatment. Only thus can the peoples of the region live in peace and strive towards the realisation of the hopes of development, progress and well-being, which they all share.\nThe remarkable recent developments on the world scene have resulted in radical changes in international relations and are truly among the most important developments we have witnessed in modern history. For the first time since the end of the Second World War, the nations of the world have realized that they share the same destiny and that the concept of collective security is indivisible and requires adequate common security mechanisms to deal with the political, economic and social problems which still confront our world.\nThe peoples of the world look forward to the formulation of a new world order that brings peace to the world on the basis of the rules of international law and the principles of justice, equality, cooperation, tolerance and fraternal relations. However, the new world order must avoid the negative aspects of the old order, which resulted in the formation of competing blocs and in polarization and which impeded international action in the fight against poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease in many parts of the world.\nThe framework of the new world order must also Include international cooperation in trade, in economic development, in disarmament, in dealing with the problem of third-world indebtedness, in the preservation of the environment and in the resolution of social problems. As the new world order it intended to govern all political, economic or social international relations, all the nations of the world have to participate on an equal footing in its formulation, so that it will be a truly universal, just and fair order.\nHowever, in the dawn of this new era of detente in International relations, we must recognise the fact that there are still intractable regional disputes which may not threaten international peace and security but are nevertheless obstacles on the road to the peace which all the world's people should enjoy in this post-cold-war era.\nMy country strongly encourages and appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in reaching solutions to these persistent regional disputes.\nThe international community still faces an ongoing arms race, compounded by the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons in an increasing number of countries.\nIn my country's view, the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons poses a danger that is in no way less than the danger posed by nuclear weapons. We therefore call upon the international community to reach agreement on the prevention of the manufacture, possession and proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Speaking of the danger posed by those weapons leads us to the topic of general disarmament. My country wishes to voice its satisfaction at the progress achieved in the area of disarmament, including conventional weapons.\nHere we must commend the recent initiative of President Bush aimed at affecting major reductions in nuclear arms. We hope that other nuclear powers will follow suit and emulate the United States.\nThe positive developments we are now witnessing in international relations will enhance the collective efforts being made in the area of economic and social development. There is undoubtedly a close link between the rates of economic growth and disarmament. Any progress towards disarmament will create positive opportunities for accelerating the process of economic development.\nThe problem of external debts which have overburdened the developing nations has impeded the progress of those countries towards achieving the goal of a better life for their peoples. This problem, as well as that of the terms of trade and the problem of transfer of technology to developing countries must be dealt with so that such problems may no longer obstruct and frustrate development efforts in the developing countries.\nThe problems of environmental pollution are a source of great concern to my country. We look forward to the convening of the United Nations Conference on Development and Environment to be held in Brazil next year. My country is all the more concerned because the Gulf war has aggravated the problems of the environment in our region due to the setting on fire of the oil wells, the resultant pollution of air and water and the threat to marine biology in the whole area of the Gulf. Similarly, the dumping of dangerous wastes and toxic materials in the developing countries has negative implications for the efforts of those countries in the areas of environment preservation and economic development.\nWe view with great satisfaction the international community's interest in social problems. My delegation is very much concerned at the increase in drug abuse by young people. We support all International efforts aimed at fighting drug abuse and hope that those efforts will lead to positive results.\nLast year's unfolding of events augured well for a new epoch in international relations. It behoves the international community to seize the opportunity of detente to grapple effectively with the numerous challenges posed by ignorance, poverty, backwardness and the deterioration of the environment. Then, and only then, will the lofty principles of justice, freedom and the equality of nations prevail and true peace and security for all the peoples of the world finally achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to speak with you as you open the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I should first like to congratulate the outgoing President, Guido de Marco of Malta, and salute our incoming President, Samir Al-Shihabi of Saudi Arabia.\nI also want to salute especially Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar, who will step down in just over three months. But let me say, Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar has served with great distinction during a period of unprecedented change and turmoil, and for almost 10 years we have enjoyed the leadership of this man of peace, a man that I, along with many Members, feel proud to call friend, and so today let us congratulate our friend and praise his spectacular service to the United Nations and to the people of the world, the Secretary-General.\nLet me also welcome new Members in this Hall, two delegations representing Korea, particularly our democratic friends, the Republic of Korea, the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and new missions from the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. Twenty years ago, when I was the Permanent Representative here for the United States, there were 132 United Nations Members. Just one week ago, 159 nations enjoyed membership in the United Nations, and today the number stands at 166. The presence of these new Members alone provides reason for us to celebrate. \nMy statement today will not sound like any you have heard from a President of the United States. I am not going to dwell on the super-Power competition that defined international politics for half a century. Instead, I will discuss the challenges of building peace and prosperity in a world leavened by the cold war's end and the resumption of history.\nCommunism held history captive for years. It suspended ancient disputes; and it suppressed ethnic rivalries, nationalist aspirations and old prejudices. As it has dissolved, suspended hatreds have sprung to life. People who for years have been denied their pasts, have begun searching for their own identities, often through peaceful and constructive means, occasionally through factionalism and bloodshed.\nThis revival of history ushers in a new era teeming with opportunities and perils. Let us begin by discussing the opportunities. First, history's renewal enables people to pursue their natural instincts for enterprise. Communism froze that progress until its failures became too much for even its defenders to bear, and now citizens throughout the world have chosen enterprise over envy, personal responsibility over the enticements of the State, prosperity over the poverty of central planning.\nThe United Nations Charter encourages this adventure by pledging to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, and I can think of no better way to fulfil this Mission than to promote the free flow of goods and Ideas, frankly, ideas and goods will travel around the globe with or without our help. The information revolution has destroyed the weapons of enforced isolation and ignorance. In many parts of the world technology has overwhelmed tyranny, proving that the age of Information can become the age of liberation, if we limit State power wisely and free our people to make the best use of new ideas, inventions and insights. By the same token, the world has learned that free markets provide levels of prosperity, growth and happiness that centrally planned economies can never offer.\nEven the most charitable estimates indicate that in recent years the free world's economies have grown at twice the rate of the former communist world. Growth does more than fill shelves; it permits every person to gain, not at the expense of others but to the benefit of others. Prosperity encourages people to live as neighbours, not as predators. Economic growth can aid international relations in exactly the same way.\nMany nations represented here are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round, the latest in the post-war series of trade negotiations, offers hope to developing nations, many of which have been cruelly divided, cruelly deceived, by the false promises of totalitarianism. Here in this Hall, we hear about North-South problems. But free and open trade, including unfettered access to markets and credit, offers developing countries means of self-sufficiency and economic dignity.\nIf the Uruguay Round should fail, a new wave of protectionism could destroy our hopes for a better future. History shows all too clearly that protectionism can destroy wealth within countries and poison relations between them. Therefore, I call upon all members of GATT to redouble their efforts to reach a successful conclusion for the Uruguay Round. I pledge that the United States will do its part.\nI cannot stress this enough: Economic progress will play a vital role In the new world. It supplies the soil in which democracy grows best. People everywhere seek government of and by the people, and they want to enjoy their inalienable rights to freedom and property and person. Challenges to democracy have failed. Just last month, coup plotters in the Soviet Union tried to derail the forces of liberty and reform, but Soviet citizens refused to follow. Most of the nations in this Hall stood with the forces of reform led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, and against the coup plotters.\nThe challenge facing the Soviet peoples now, that of building political systems based upon individual liberty, minority rights, democracy and free markets, mirrors every nation's responsibility for encouraging peaceful, democratic reform, but it also testifies to the extraordinary power of the democratic ideal. As democracy flourishes, so does the opportunity (or a third historical breakthrough, international cooperation. A year ago, the Soviet Union joined the United States and a host of other nations in defending a tiny country against aggression and opposing Saddam Hussein. For the very first time on a matter of major importance super-Power competition was replaced with international cooperation. The United Nations, in one of its finest moments, constructed a measured, principled, deliberate and courageous response to Saddam Hussein. It stood up to an outlaw who invaded Kuwait, who threatened many States within the region, who sought to set a menacing precedent for the post-cold-war world.\nThe coalition effort established a model for the collective settlement of disputes. Members sat the goal - the liberation of Kuwait - and devised a courageous, unified means of achieving that goal. Mow, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfil the United Nations Charter's ambition of working \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\". Those are the words of the Charter.\nHe will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents. In Europe and Asia, nationalist passions have flared anew, challenging borders, straining the fabric of international society. At the same time, around the world many age-old conflicts still fester. We see signs of this tumult right here. The United Nations has mounted more peace-keeping missions in the last 36 months than during its first 43 years, and although we now seem mercifully liberated from the fear of nuclear holocaust, these smaller, virulent conflicts should trouble us all.\nWe must face this challenge squarely - first, by pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes now in progress; secondly, and more importantly, by trying to prevent others from erupting. No one hare can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time, but we must strive to ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of border disputes.\nWe must also promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the Charter's pledge to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours. United Nations General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX), the so-called \\\"Zionism is racism\\\" resolution, mocks this pledge and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded, and I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy; it is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the State of Israel, and to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in the Second World War - and indeed throughout history. To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a Member in good standing of the United Nations. This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's right to exist. By repealing this resolution unconditionally the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.\nAs we work to meet the challenge posed by the resumption of history, we also must defend the Charter's emphasis on inalienable human rights. Government has failed if citizens cannot speak their mind, if they cannot form political parties freely and elect governments without coercion, it they cannot practice their religion freely, if they cannot raise their families in peace, if they cannot enjoy a just return from their labour, if they cannot live fruitful lives and at the end of their days look upon their achievements and their society's, progress with pride. Politicians who talk about democracy and freedom but provide neither eventually will feel the sting of public disapproval and the power of peoples yearning to live free.\nSome nations still deny their basic rights to the people, and too many voices cry out for freedom. For example, the people of Cuba suffer oppression at the hands of a dictator who has not got the word, the lone hold-out in an otherwise democratic hemisphere, a man who has not adapted to a world that has no use for totalitarian tyranny. Elsewhere, despots ignore the heartening fact that the rest of the world is embarked upon a new age of liberty.\nThe renewal of history also imposes an obligation to remain vigilant about new threats and old. He must expand our efforts to control nuclear proliferation. We must work to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.\nIt is for this reason that I put forward my Middle East arms initiative, a comprehensive approach to stop and, where possible, reverse the accumulation of arms in that part of the world moat prone to violence. We must remember that self-interest will tug nations in different directions, and that struggles over perceived interests will flare sometimes into violence. We can never say with confidence where the next conflict may arise. And we cannot promise eternal peace - not while demagogue peddle false promises to people hungry with hope; not while terrorists use our citizens as pawns and drug dealers destroy our peoples. He, as a result, must band together to overwhelm affronts to basic human dignity. It is no longer acceptable to shrug and say that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Let us put the law above the crude and cowardly practice of hostage-holding.\nIn a world defined by change, we must be as firm in principle as we are flexible in our response to changing international conditions. That is especially true today of Iraq. Six months after the adoption of Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991), Saddam continues to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction and to subject the Iraqi people to brutal repression. Saddam's contempt for United Nations resolutions was first demonstrated back in August 1990, and it continues even as I am speaking. His Government refuses to permit unconditional helicopter inspections, and right now is refusing to allow United Nations inspectors to leave inspected premises with documents relating to an Iraqi nuclear weapons programme. It is the view of the United States that we must keep the United Nations sanctions in place as long as he remains in power. This also shows that we cannot compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. And we will not compromise.\nThis is not to say - let me be clear on this point - that we should punish the Iraqi people. Let me repeat: our argument has never been with the people of Iraq. It was, and is, with a brutal dictator whose arrogance dishonours the Iraqi people. Security Council resolution 706 (1991) created a responsible mechanism for sending humanitarian relief to innocent Iraqi citizens. He must put that mechanism to work. Ma must not abandon our principled stand against Saddam's aggression. This cooperative effort has liberated Kuwait. Now it can lead to a just government in Iraq. And when it does - when it does - the Iraqi people can look forward to better lives, free at home, free to engage in a world beyond their borders.\nThe resumption of history also permits the United Nations to resume the important business of promoting the values that I have discussed today. This body can serve as a vehicle through which willing parties can settle old disputes. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar and his successor as we pursue peace in such diverse and divided lands as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador, and Western Sahara. The United Nations can encourage free market development through its international lending and aid institutions. However, it should not dictate the particular forms of government that nations should adopt. It can, and should, encourage the values upon which the Organization was founded. Together, we should insist that nations seeking our acceptance meet standards of human decency.\nWhere institutions of freedom have lain dormant, the United Nations can offer them new life. These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order, an order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty, an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to force, the cooperative development of disputes rather than anarchy and bloodshed, and an unstinting belief in human rights.\nFinally, you may wonder about America's role the new world I have described. Let me assure you, the United States has no intention of striving for a pax americana. However, we will remain engaged. We will not retreat and pull back into isolationism. We will offer friendship and leadership. In short, we seek a pax universalis, built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.\nTo all assembled: We have an opportunity to spare our sons and daughters the sins and errors of the past. We can build a future more satisfying than any our world has ever known. The future lies undefined before us, full of promise, littered with peril. We can choose the kind of world we want: one blistered by the fires of war and subjected to the winds of coercion and chance, or one made more peaceful by reflection and choice. Take this challenge seriously. Inspire future generations to praise and venerate you, to say, \\\"On the ruins of conflict, these brave men and women built an era of peace and understanding. They inaugurated a new world order, an order worth preserving for the ages.\\\"\nGood luck to each and every one of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
