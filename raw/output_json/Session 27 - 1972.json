        "file_text": "Mr. President, in calling upon you to lead the work of this session, the General Assembly has recognized in you the qualities required by such high responsibilities, which your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, carried out with competence and distinction. If that election is a tribute to your qualities and your experience, it is also a tribute paid to your country, whose fate for centuries was linked to almost all the painful changes that occurred in Europe through which its sons, generation after generation, did honor to the independence of peoples and the dignity of man.\n122.\tIt is also the consecration of the universality of our Organization, because all of the Member States without exception are entitled to assume the highest positions in it. This privilege is all the more deserved because Poland, of which you are one of the leaders, has with courage and equanimity made a signal contribution to the abatement of tension in Europe and to the strengthening of what we already call, with reason I hope, international detente.\n123.\tIt is not in order to exercise the demons of the hot war or the cold war that we like to call the present development in international relations a detente stage. Of course, the present state of the world still provides many serious reasons for concern, preoccupation and even anguish, and the road will still be long and difficult before the international community can feel that it is confidently moving towards that security and peace to which it aspires. But this evolution, timid and problematical as it may be, is already substantially changing the nature and quality of relations among the main Powers, whose antagonisms and confrontation were precisely the main source of the crisis which has marked the last 25 years. A series of events has occurred in the last two years which had been impossible to conceive of, at least not in the near future, in any analysis of the previous international situation.\n124.\tThe visit of Chancellor Brandt to Warsaw, the meetings between the leaders of the two Germanys, the Moscow summit and the ratification of the German-Soviet agreements are the most significant stages of this process which has made it possible to substitute dialog for mistrust, at least with respect to the problems of Europe, a region which was one of the most serious hotbeds of crises in the post-war period.\n125.\tAnother series of events has spread the same spirit to Asia and paved the way for making the most striking changes of our times. The restoration to People's China of all its rights and its admission to the United Nations, and the visit of President Nixon to Peking are in fact significant portents that the great Powers have realized the limits of the respective powers and have undertaken from now on progressively to normalize their relations.\n126.\tIn Asia again, the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan to China and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries at one stroke changed all the political considerations to which we had become accustomed and opened a new chapter in their history and in that of all mankind. The agreement between those two countries, the one with all its potential and the other with all its power, promises Asia an international role genuinely in keeping with its size and is a primary feature in the change in the world balance. Moreover, the constant readjustment of this balance, in our view, offers the best chance of safeguarding international peace and security.\n127.\tThe non-aligned countries, which had organized themselves during the most crucial years of the cold war and held out against pressure as well as persuasion, can today be legitimately proud of having been able, through the mere force of their conviction, to set themselves aside from the influence of either block. Their principles and their action were to a very large extent important factors in the evolution of relations among the great Powers. If they rejoice in seeing that detente is emerging in one part of the world or has already become consolidated in another, they remain watchful and sometimes apprehensive of the risk that the new balance established among the great Powers might confront those Powers with the temptation of engaging in a simple reapportionment of roles, influences and interests in the various parts of the world. They want this detente to be indivisible and beneficial to the whole of the international community. In this very hall over a. full decade they have made of this a profession of faith whose defense was not always without its dangers.\n128.\tIn this connexion, I should like to pay a tribute to U Thant, who had felt and shared in this aspiration and who contributed with remarkable patience to the emergence of this new political context which brought us from the cold war to detente. I also know, Mr. Secretary-General, what esteem and trust have been reposed in you, and I am convinced that with the qualities that you possess which have long since established your reputation that you will be able to lead us from detente to peace.\n129.\tA few minutes ago I spoke of the wish of countries such as mine to see this detente spread to all parts of the world, and despite the most natural feeling of national egoism, I have recorded Morocco's satisfaction at the emerging signs that peace is returning to some continents. But the continent of which Morocco is a part is still outside this charmed circle. The international community, which in the past quarter of a century has undertaken a deep reconsideration of the philosophies and values upon which it bases its behavior and which succeeded in changing its structure on the basis of a more tolerant ethic, still runs up against the colonial concept which, on the African continent, has assumed its most inhuman and most intolerable form since that phenomenon spread by successive waves over our continent during the last century. These foundations of colonialism, which were none the less solemnly repudiated within the framework of the new morality governing relations among peoples, still persist in Africa, where the process of decolonization which began in the 1950s has not been accelerated as we would have wished. And yet there are still nations with the most advanced civilizations which practice colonialism and others which support it, while both in the past either through their religion or their humanism have played a very important role in the changes brought about in relations among men. How are we to explain the indifference or the inertia shown by some Powers in this very Organization which sometimes, without any reason other than that of an alliance, ignore the courageous and desperate struggle of peoples aspiring to achieve their respect and dignity?\n130.\tAware of this immobility, if not of this helplessness, those peoples have been taking their fate into their own hands to an ever-increasing extent and have irrevocably chosen the narrow and painful road of struggle. This courage has earned them the sympathy and assistance of a large sector of the international community. But the African States in particular feel that it is their overriding duty to help and support these peoples. During the last summit meeting of the OAU, which my country had the honor of welcoming at Rabat, the member States demonstrated in the most striking terms their wide and effective support of these peoples. The liberation of Africa was the dominant theme of the meeting and practical measures were taken to ensure that the struggle will be supported wholeheartedly. But if they are determined to wage an all-out struggle because it has been forced upon them by their opponents, they know that this Organization, by reason of its Charter and its political action, could shorten that suffering. What can be the power of South Africa or Portugal which allows them to claim that they are and will remain Members of this Organization and sometimes to behave here in an arrogant fashion while they contemptuously and disdainfully ignore the innumerable resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly with the support of most of the great Powers? What is Southern Rhodesia compared to the power of Great Britain in the first instance, and of the international majority 14\nwhich has condemned its secession and the policy of brutal segregation which followed thereon.\n131.\tIt is true that the Secretary-General recently traveled to South Africa and Namibia and that he engaged in difficult talks with the Pretoria leaders. Without underestimating the positive nature of that initiative and of the new mission now being undertaken by the Secretary- General's representative for Namibia, we shall not harbor any illusions until we become convinced that because of these efforts the South African authorities will consent to engage in a dialog within the meaning of international decisions defining the legal status of that Territory, and within the terms of the resolutions clearly clearly setting out the steps for its liberation. Ambassador Escher, the representative of the Secretary-General, enjoys our confidence. I hope that he will provide us elements likely to make us less skeptical.\n132.\tAs for Portugal, which is waging a total war in three regions of Africa, it should begin by realizing that, despite the means placed at its disposal, the resistance movements in Guinea (Bissau), as in Angola and Mozambique, have succeeded in establishing themselves in those Territories with a remarkable organization that makes it possible to associate with them all of the liberated populations in a venture that becomes more effective day by day. What indication could Portugal give us to make us understand that this country is finally ready to engage in a dialog with the United Nations which could progressively substitute politics for war? The nationalist leaders confronting it have proven their courage, their authority and their ability and are able to shoulder all their responsibilities. Africa has also clearly assumed its responsibilities: it supports their resistance, it determinedly and tirelessly pursues its political action at the international level and within this Organization. However, this same Africa which is still plagued by difficulties inherent in its rapid change and which is still confronted, both at home and abroad, with problems that are at times insurmountable, has proved at Rabat that it was capable of overcoming the problems inherent in its evolution and in the clarification of its interstate relations, just as it has shown itself able to cope with its responsibilities at the international level with the realization that it is an important factor in international life and that, for the world to feel concern for its problems, it must, in its turn, join ever more closely in the settlement of the world's affairs. These are the factors which the friends of Africa, as well as its opponents, have called the spirit of Rabat. We hope that next year this spirit will live again in another African capital.\n133.\tBut to this analysis which, at the start of this statement, I intended to be a positive one, I must add that Africa is not the only area where the situation obliges us to recognize the persistence of .tensions and dangers still threatening security and peace. It has by now become a chronic phenomenon, especially during the last five years, for this Organization to consider the situation created in the Middle East by the Israeli against several States in that region at a pace which does away with the myth of the cease-fire and brutally reminds us that the aggression is continuous and generalized. This Organization has taken a whole series of decisions, at the level of both the Security Council and the General Assembly, establishing a framework for the search for a solution aimed at eliminating the results of the aggression of 1967, and especially at evacuating the occupied Arab territories and recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestine people.\n134.\tNumerous approaches were undertaken both within the framework of these resolutions and among the great Powers in their talks, or through the initiative of one country or another. The Arab States have constantly lent their support to these approaches and have set up no obstacles in their way. But Israel has, invariably, on one pretext or another, blocked all such action and every such initiative. It rejects the resolutions of the Security Council, it refuses to engage in any co-operation no matter how slight with the representative of the Secretary-General, it denounces agreement among the four great Powers, it even opposes the Rogers plan. What is more, while opposing any search for a just and equitable solution, it continues its attacks, on an increasingly violent scale, against Syria and Lebanon, in particular. Convinced that it can rely on the requirements of a particular combination of circumstances in the internal life of a great Power, in one single week it launched two attacks against Syria and bombed and invaded the territory of Lebanon. And when the Security Council meets to consider these deliberate aggressions, the exercise of the veto by one permanent member guarantees the absence of any Council decision against Israel.\n135.\tIt is particularly dangerous to international peace that a situation such as the one now prevailing in the Middle East should continue without being given serious attention, as if this Organization and the international conscience that it is supposed to represent had abdicated before a fait accompli carried out with inexplicable impunity. What does Israel hope for? Is it hoping that, once it is assured of this indifference and this impotence on the part of the United Nations, it could, at will, launch its aggression against any country it chooses, for which it is free to define the objective and determine the duration? Well, this is now the fact, and the vetoes in the Security Council will henceforth assure it that it can repeat these aggressions without any risk to itself.\n136.\tOn several occasions the leaders of the Arab countries directly concerned have clearly announced their readiness to support any initiative that, with full respect for existing resolutions and while preserving their dignity, would serve to set in motion a process capable of facilitating the restoration of peace to the area. After five years, this show of goodwill and patience has been put to the test and these States, conscious of their responsibilities to their own peoples find themselves constrained to resort more and more to other possibilities that certainly do not bring peace any closer.\n137.\tThis situation was vigorously denounced this year by all of the African States meeting in June at Rabat, and by the 62 non-aligned countries meeting in August at Georgetown. The persistence of the crisis and its unforeseeable future course can be laid only at the door of Israel and those members of the international community whose indifference is interpreted by Israel as tacit encouragement. In the face of such a clear-cut situation there can be no alibi. Especially not the alibi called terrorism.\n138.\tWe do not hesitate to declare solemnly that we are opposed to all forms of violence, that blood shed by violence must be deplored, whatever the nationality, the race or the religion of the victim. For several decades we in fact have always been on the side of the victim of violence rather than on that of its perpetrators. And if today the explosive power of certain words is deliberately being intensified, it is exclusively for the purpose of adjusting them to their intended use. First of all, what is terrorism? We exclude from the definition that people are now trying to work out any act motivated by the defense of a legitimate and inalienable right which the law has failed to protect. This principle, in our view, applies as much as to an individual as to a group and, a fortiori, to an entire people. An objectively violent act, may have legitimate motivations and, speaking of the actions of Palestinians, let us clearly say that this involves the expression of one of the most painful aspects of the crisis in the Middle East, namely, that where there is aggression there is necessarily resistance.\n139.\tThe Palestine people was coldly and cynically abandoned in 1948; half of that people remained as hostage to those occupying its country; half was driven from its houses, its lands, beyond its border, to yield its place to foreigners coming from every corner of the globe. That people for a long time hoped that those supposedly assisting it would help in the recovery of its homeland and its dignity. The Arab countries for 25 years have tried to denounce the flagrant injustice committed against their people with the blessing of those who today criticize them. They have failed so far. But a new generation, raised in frustration, often in poverty, has, on coming of age, at least regained the moral and unalterable inheritance of which nothing can deprive a great people: its dignity. To express this thirst for justice and dignity it has tried the only ways and means which the political order existing in the world has left at its disposal. These were ineffectual, since its rights continued to be ignored. This international community, from which it sought justice, apparently did not understand its despair and its cry for help, while like all people in history, it used the sublime recourse which is the gift of life itself to remind the world of its existence. There is no need to seek elsewhere, other than to understand the actions of the sons of this lost Palestine.\n140.\tThat truth, which we painfully feel and which we express with the utmost regret, is also useful in our opinion to the search for a true peace in this area, a vital part of the Mediterranean basin. And, we, at the opposite end of the Mediterranean are trying to work out and agree, with our neighbors of the south and the north, on the basis for a co-operation likely to ensure to all of us permanent security and prosperity. The Maghreb, if it has not yet succeeded, is progressing happily with confidence in and respect for that unity which is the deep aspiration of all its peoples.\n141.\tOn the shores of Europe, the Common Market is expanding and Europe is working on a political unity which we think could be a positive factor in the stability which Europe has been seeking since the end of the war, the stability necessary to ensure to it its rightful role in the world. Linked by history, convinced of the similarity of our interests and desirous to the same extent of avoiding falling under the hegemony of the great Powers, we are formulating together the hope of finding around this sea sufficient motivation to strengthen our ties in a solid and lasting way.\n142.\tWe rejoice in the possibility, which we hope will come about very soon, of a conference on European security. The peoples of Europe, who throughout history have often had a common destiny, can reasonably expect today to build together a world in which they will recover their true vocation and their common hope. If we greet this conference with joy, we also think that European security would be incomplete and fragile without security for the Mediterranean and for all the peoples living along its shores. That is why we are most interested in having our problems taken into consideration at that conference.\n143.\tIf Europe thinks that the Rhine or the Elbe are the axes of its destiny, we believe equally strongly that the Mediterranean is ours, and that we are seriously concerned about this. In Morocco we are gratified by the relationships we maintain with all the countries of the northern coast. There are so many affinities and so many interests binding us together that our will co co-operate with them is an inevitable element in our destiny. I should like to say especially to one of those countries with which we have had a kind of centuries-old historical intimacy, that we are aware of the fact that our positions in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean could in future lead us to establishing closer co-operation then in the past; and while the reservoir of friendship accumulated during that common history is an important factor in any calm consideration of such cooperation, I must say just as frankly that the road towards this common action must be cleared of anything that might give rise to conflicts and misunderstandings.\n144.\tThe rather serious dispute which existed between us and Spain has appreciably lightened in recent years, but it still involves fundamental divergences which continue to be a source of concern. I have in mind the problem of the Sahara. The desire to preserve the potential benefits of the future has consistently led us to seek in frank and loyal dialog a solution which would redress the consequences of past phenomena which are no longer valid in our present day world, and which Spain has from this very rostrum strongly condemned when it claimed the legitimate return of Gibraltar to its national territory. We have carried forward a dialog for many years and action at United Nations level in which Spain is no longer facilitating our progress towards a solution, as it did in the past in accordance with our admission.\n145.\tTrue friends know how to overcome quarrels. Both sides must also be aware of their duty not to sacrifice such important prospects for co-operation to misunderstandings which in the long-run may imperil the deepest friendship.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Canadian delegation looks forward with hope and determination to the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session, over which you will preside. We count upon you for that same wisdom and judgment which characterized your distinguished predecessor's term of office. Your election is a mark of our high regard for you and for your country. Poland symbolizes for the world the unquenchable flame of national will blazing out after centuries of darkness. We remember that the terrible war which brought this Organization into existence began in the defense of Poland's national independence. We remember, too, the debt every country in the world not least my own owes to the Polish people in all the arts of civilization. How fitting it is, Mr. President, that the year of your election should be the five hundredth anniversary of the birth of that towering genius, Nicolaus Copernicus, to whom all mankind stands debtor.\n23.\tMay I welcome you also, Mr. Secretary-General, to the indispensable duties upon which you have embarked so vigorously. With the whole world as your province, you have already traveled widely. Canada was honored by one of your first visits as Secretary-General, as it was some years ago by your first appointment as ambassador of your country.\n24.\tYour concern for both the authority and the efficiency of the United Nations has been evident from the outset in the measures you have taken to assert the one and enhance the other. You have our admiration and our support. It is a current commonplace to take a dark view of the performance and prospects of the United Nations. One respected international commentator observed just the other day that \\\"the United Nations has never been weaker than it is now\\\", while your predecessor, Mr. Secretary- General, has called the phase through which the Organization is now passing \\\"a time of trials\\\".\n25.\tThere is ample evidence to justify a sense of defeatism. The international community often seems incapable of preventing war, powerless in the face of acts of terrorism, apathetic at the spectacle of starvation and misery, and irresponsible in its willingness to risk permanent damage to the environment. We seek to explain this by observing that in a world of sovereign nation-States, the United Nations is bound to reflect the weaknesses of the international society which produced it. Time and again, national egotism seems to be the ruling principle of that society.\n26.\tThis is at the root of the world's deep anxiety. For the better part of this century, we have known that nationalism has imperfections. Yet mankind is not about to do away with sovereign States. Indeed, the events of the century, by breaking up old empires and multiplying new sovereignties, have acted as a stimulus to nationalism. New States are not willing to deny themselves the advantages they believe older States have gained from national independence. Certain great tasks of social and economic construction are indeed impossible except in conditions of independence and, while some advantages of independence may prove illusory, even this is irrelevant since the Charter establishes national sovereignty as a fundamental principle.\n27.\tThose are powerful considerations. In the face of them, it is unrealistic to plan for an international order in which the system based upon sovereign national units has been replaced. Instead, it is more hopeful and more sensible to work to transform the existing system, encouraging it when necessary to produce the antidote to its own poisons.\n28: There have been encouraging developments in this sense recently. Even in the brief space of time since last we met, relationships between the great Powers have undergone' a remarkable transformation. Earlier this year, the two nuclear super-Powers signed a declaration on basic principles governing their relations,  an agreement limiting anti-ballistic missile systems,  and an interim agreement on the limitation of strategic arms.  Furthermore, the Soviet Union and the United States have reaffirmed the undertaking in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] to pursue their negotiations to end the nuclear arms race and bring about actual measures of nuclear disarmament.2 The nuclear sponsors of the non-proliferation Treaty have a particular responsibility to adopt measures to curtail the nuclear arms race and thereby prevent further nuclear proliferation. One such measure would be a ban on all nuclear testing. Surely it is time for the two super-Powers to end underground tests, for the two States which continue to test in the atmosphere to cease their testing, and for a complete test ban to be concluded.\n29.\tThe international community has a right to expect that the agreements concluded in Moscow will open the way to more far-reaching nuclear arms control and disarmament measures. But it by no means under-estimates the historic significance of what has already been accomplished. Surely this amounts to a recognition that the search for a one-sided strategic advantage has become self-defeating and illusory and that the way ahead lies through a stabilized nuclear balance to nuclear disarmament itself.\n30.\tIn this same brief space of time to which I have referred, the People's Republic of China has, to Canada's great satisfaction, taken its rightful place in the United Nations. Relations between China and the United States and between China and Japan have witnessed a dramatic improvement. In Europe, breeding-ground of two world wars, the most significant steps in this generation have been taken to reconstruct relations between the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and the German Democratic Republic, Poland and the Soviet Union on the other. The first general negotiations on co-operation and security in Europe since before the Second World War, as well as negotiations to bring about a mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe, will soon begin.\n31.\tCaution says of course that all these developments are only beginnings. But they could mark the greatest change in the international order since the United Nations was founded. If we are right to say that the United Nations reflects the international order on which it is based, can we be wrong to hope that these beginnings will sooner or later transform the United Nations as well? There are other hopeful developments. Dialogs have now begun between the two halves of Germany and Korea. These face enormous difficulties. But we can expect that in the not-too- distant future the universality of the United Nations will be strengthened through the extension of membership to the peoples of the divided countries. It will be strengthened also as self-determination brings the era of colonial empires to its final end, especially in Africa, where the most intractable problems of securing human dignity and freedom are posed. Although the recent proceedings of the Security Council give little support to the view, surely it is no longer visionary to conceive of situations in which the Council will function as was originally intended, by consensus of the permanent members and of the United Nations as a whole, through co-operation rather than through confrontation.\n32.\tWe founded the United Nations, as the Charter says, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". More has been accomplished in this past year to remove that danger than in any year since this Organization was created. Certainly so far as the risk of a general nuclear war is concerned, the hopeful evolution of great-Power relationships evokes deep feelings of relief, gratitude and satisfaction from us all.\n33.\tIt would be a bitter irony if the safer, saner world which seems at last a possibility rather than a dream should turn instead into a world in which the stream of violence simply cuts new channels.\n34.\tTime and again, the smaller countries have called for an end to the nuclear arms race, an end to nuclear confrontation. We have sought an international order in which the great Powers conceived it neither as to their interest nor as their obligation to police the world. Now the great Powers, in their own interest and in the interest of us all, are moving in this direction. Is the new security and freedom which will thereby be available to all countries, large and small, to be dissipated in new forms of violence? Must we admit that only the fear of nuclear escalation has allowed us some limited success in the past generation in controlling recourse to force? Yet the international community still has no answer to the dilemma of deciding at what point local violence has such wide and obvious international implications that it can no longer be accepted as a purely domestic matter. We struggled with this problem last year during the crisis in Bangladesh. Even where violence is plainly international from the outset, our means of dealing with it are often pitifully weak. There are those in the world who appear to believe that the norms of civilized international life are not for them. They consider that they have a right to pursue their grievances by kidnapping, piracy, murder and wholesale terror and violence.\n35.\tThe problem is growing. It has become world-wide. My own country has had its tragic experience of violence of this sort. Canadians instinctively share the horror and shock which these acts produce wherever in the world they may occur. The Canadian Government understands only too well the agonizing choices Governments face when called upon to deal with a sudden nightmare of violence.\n36.\tTerrorism takes many forms. It is called forth by a wide range of complex situations. The rights and wrongs of these situations are bitterly contested. It is simple realism to recognize all this. But the problem cannot be ignored because it is difficult. There must be no truce with terror. Some acts of terror are the work of deluded and demented criminals, others of frustrated and desperate men willing to sacrifice their own lives and the lives of innocent people in what they regard as a noble cause. When we agree that the cause is noble, we are tempted to condone the terror. But are we wise to do so? The act we condone today may be the one we regret tomorrow, when it is turned against us, for terrorism in the end affects everyone: it is an attack on civilization at large. Violence breeds violence, murder answers murder, and order dissolves in chaos.\n37.\tTherefore, we approve the Secretary-General's initiative in seeking to have the subject placed on the agenda [A/8791 and Add.lJ. A number of delegations have reservations about the debate upon which the Assembly is to enter. Some fear it will be too diffuse to be useful; others that it will be too narrow to be constructive. It need be neither. The Canadian delegation looks upon the debate as a way to focus international concern upon the whole range of acts of terror and to stimulate action both by international bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Red Cross and by Governments acting within their o vn powers or under bilateral agreements.\n38.\tThe means of dealing with the problem will be as varied as its forms. Some international legal instruments already exist for the purpose. Those should be quickly strengthened through ratification by as many States as possible. Perhaps new international machinery and new international legal instruments will be necessary as well. Then let us create them. How can the world, which has declared slavery, piracy and the drug traffic beyond the pale of civilized life, fail to outlaw terrorism? The Canadian Government, which has already amended its domestic law, entered into bilateral negotiations to limit terrorism in the form of hijacking and ratified the international conventions concerned, stands ready to contribute to the strengthening of international law to outlaw terror.\n39.\tThe task is formidable. But the United Nations has responded to challenges of equal difficulty in the past. Since we cannot expect national loyalties to disappear, we must work to temper those loyalties by a growing sense of responsibility on the part of individuals and Governments to the international community at large. I suggest that a consciousness of this responsibility is growing in ways unknown to previous generations.\n40.\tConsider the field of human rights. It would be easy to multiply examples of violations of human rights throughout the world. The task of creating and ensuring respect for agreed international standards ha^ been daunting. Deep historic and cultural differences have produced widely differing views of the true source and proper extent of individual rights. Those differences are profound. How can we legislate them out of existence? Yet and I would draw this to the Assembly's attention the international community has successfully legislated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex]. In doing so, it has recognized that there are limits to the exercise of State sovereignty and that certain rights attach to individuals among others, the rights to life and freedom, to liberty and personal security, to fair and prompt justice, to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the right to leave any country, including one's own.\n41.\tThe task now is to ensure that these rights are honored in practice. So far as my country is concerned, I am glad to say that the constitutional difficulties which have delayed Canadian ratification of the human rights Covenants are well on the way to being overcome. Through national experience and international example, Canadians have come to appreciate that the field of human rights is another sphere in which national and international obligations reinforce each other.\n42.\tAmong the most serious challenges to the honoring of human rights today are those that lie in Africa. In South Africa the very system of apartheid does violence to the concepts embodied by the international community in the two Covenants on human rights. In Rhodesia an illegal regime continues to deny the majority of its citizens even the hope of the basic rights to which they are entitled, and now, in Uganda, a new form of danger has arisen. I do not wish to enter into the substance of the question. Obviously, however, the situation in Uganda requires the exercise of the greatest restraint on the part of the Ugandan Government if the Asian community is to be allowed to leave in conditions of reasonable dignity and security. Humanity on the part of other Governments is required as well, so that the tens of thousands who may ultimately be affected by enforced expulsion may have a generous reception in the many countries of the world where their talents could find new and useful expression.\n43.\tThe great programs for economic co-operation' between the developing and the industrialized world are another instance in which a growing sense of obligation to the international community has become an expression of enlightened nationalism. The whole notion that this world venture should be undertaken at all has become part of general public consciousness only in the last 20 years. And once again those who are looking for reasons to be discouraged after a relatively brief effort find their case ready made. From the statistics of the first United Nations Development Decade we know that per capita incomes in the developed countries-already far higher than in the third world have been growing at not much less than twice the rate of incomes in the developing countries. We know that in the developed countries the consumption of energy per capita is 5 to 10 times the world average and that, quite apart from the difference in protein content, the intake of food in calories is almost twice as much per capita as in the developing world.\n44.\tThose gaps are great. Some of them are growing. Meanwhile, the efforts of the developing countries to strengthen their economies are partially absorbed in supporting populations which in Asia, Africa and Latin America are growing at the rate of between 2 and 3 per cent a year-double or more the rate for Europe and North America.\n45.\tThe resources devoted to attacking these problems of development and disparity are undeniably inadequate. If they are to be increased in quantity and quality the developing countries must continue their heroic efforts while the developed world finds ways of increasing the measure of its participation. The attack must focus equally on social issues, given the interdependence of social progress and economic growth.\n46.\tIn Canada, I am glad to say, sustained public consciousness of these problems has permitted the Government to make steadily increasing resources available for programs of economic co-operation. I expect this trend to continue. It will be combined with an intensified search to ensure that the co-operation is extended in the forms we are best fitted to provide and our partners are best fitted to use. Hand in hand with this will go measures to improve the terms on which the developing countries have access to our markets.\n47.\tIn economic relations generally, discouragement at some current tendencies would be justified. There is will an inadequate international framework within which to adjust the trading relations of the developed with the developing economies, and the market with the socialist economies. Among the major trading nations there are distressing tendencies towards protectionism, associated in part with the growth of trading blocs.\n48.\tInternational monetary machinery labors under extra-ordinary strains and urgently requires strengthening. Yet all these problems are recognized. They are under repeated attack in the Economic and Social Council, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the regional economic commissions and elsewhere, and not without success. In the last analysis a sense of common purpose leads gradually to overcoming national differences.\n49.\tIf we wish to measure our progress we have only to recall the economic chaos of the period between the two world wars. Then rampant nationalism combined with economic ignorance to bring the world economic system down in ruins. How many of the political failures of that period can be traced to economic failures? For all their faults, the present world economic structure and the institutional framework for economic co-operation which has grown up under the United Nations are an infinite improvement.\n50.\tBut perhaps the most dramatic example of the rapid development of an international conscience and a sense of international responsibility concerns the protection of the environment. Even 10 years ago threats to the balance of nature were a matter for specialists. The public generally, and governments generally, were hardly aware that problems existed. In a matter of a few years we have awakened to the risk that we may be doing irreversible harm to the** natural order which sustains life upon the planet.\n51.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was the world community's first response to that challenge. It will undoubtedly take its place as one of the major conferences in United Nations history. Through its Declaration  the Conference has established a kind of \\\"environment charter\\\", providing a sound basis for the development of international environmental law and other co-operative measures for the protection and enhancement of the human environment. The recommendations for action agreed to by the Conference  demonstrate the willingness of Governments to work towards that goal. The endorsement of those recommendations consistent with the spirit and sense of purpose displayed in the Declaration will, in the Canadian view, be one of the major achievements of this Assembly, for the Stockholm Conference enunciated'.fundamental principles of international environ-mental law.\n52.\tThe international community now has an opportunity to make a further advance in strengthening the international legal regime as it affects the environment. This is in relation to the law of the sea. Canada, like many other countries, is in favor of convening the third law of the sea conference in 1973, but only if preparations are adequate. This will be possible if the sea-bed Committee  is able to hold two further sessions during 1973. Then the conference could be formally launched with an organizational meeting in the fall of 1973.\n53.\tThose who wrote the Charter of the United Nations had certain clear ideas about what was needed to preserve international peace and security. They inherited some social, economic and legal machinery, and devised more. But the most foreseeing of them could not have anticipated many of the problems that have preoccupied the United Nations since. The whole range of exercises in peacekeeping; the transition to the post-colonial world; the machinery for economic co-operation between the developed and the developing countries; the extended protection of human rights; the work accomplished in relation to the environment, the sea-bed and outer space all these endeavors have called forth activity unimaginable in 1945.\n54.\tIn a remarkable way this Organization has risen to these demands. It has done so by creating a large and complex family of agencies-so large and complex, indeed, that strong administrative leadership is as crucial to the continued authority of the United Nations as political leadership itself. To ensure that the machinery functions at maximum effectiveness on a sound and equitable financial basis is a problem of the first order. The Canadian delegation will work to ensure that this problem receives the steady attention it deserves. Considerations of cost and complexity are, however, a reminder that a price has to be paid if the United Nations is to be flexible and dynamic.\n55.\tI contend that it has displayed these qualities. The successive challenges of the last generation have been met with only two changes in the Charter: the increase in the membership of both the Security Council and of the Economic and Social Council. Apart from this, we have built upon the Charter machinery, giving a living interpretation to the Charter itself. While it has been difficult in practice to secure the required degree of agreement to amend the Charter, this does not seem to have prevented the United Nations from keeping up with the times. Canada is ready to look seriously at any specific proposals to amend the Charter or make it work better if these have broad support among Member States. But I am not convinced that a new Charter that could be agreed upon would be better than the Charter written in 1945.\n56.\tI have struck a hopeful note, and I may be criticized for that, but I am convinced that this is the right perspective. We have to concentrate on the problems of the day. This Assembly will have to concentrate on measures to prevent terrorism, consolidate our first advance in the environmental field, secure administrative and budgetary reform, protect human rights in Africa and elsewhere, and develop international law, especially the law of the sea and the law governing air piracy. Meanwhile the Security Council may well be obliged to deal with threats to peace-for example, if the current tension in the Middle East rises dangerously. All these matters are sources of deep concern. To deal with them successfully to deal with them at all-will, we know, lead us at times into anger, frustration and despair.\n57.\tIt is therefore a healthy corrective to lift our heads above these problems on occasion, to remind ourselves of the great work the United Nations has accomplished in the past and to seek to trace those currents in human affairs which give hope chat its greatest accomplishments lie ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, before addressing this twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly, may I congratulate you on your election as President. Your qualities of energy and flexibility, understanding and experience, are a firm guarantee for the success of our work. To these words of tribute I wish to add the tribute of my people to the Polish people, to which we have traditionally felt linked by ties of friendship and understanding.\n126.\tThis session is the first to be held since Mr. Waldheim took up his duties as Secretary-General. Therefore I cannot fail to state publicly our deep satisfaction and extend our sincere congratulations to him. Since Austria and Spain shared an unforgettable period of their histories a few centuries ago, I am well aware, as a Spaniard, of the promise of success in the hard and difficult task of being Secretary-General implied by the election of Mr. Waldheim, who is devoted to the service of peace and international justice.\n127.\tOnce again voices throughout the world are bringing to this hall expressions of hope and disappointment; once again we are reckoning the balance-sheet of successes and failures, of encouraging signs and ominous portents. These expressions of light and shadow reflect not only the fact that the work of the United Nations, like every human endeavor, is marked equally by successes and shortcomings but also a much more deep-rooted and disturbing fact. We all know the aims and purposes of the Charter, but after 27 years we continue without having found the precise picture of how our Organization should act as an instrument of peace and co-operation. We all want peace, but we have not been able to find the instrument for peace. We all recognize the value of co-operation, but we have not been able to create effective tools to be placed in the hands of man to achieve this.\n128.\tPerhaps the reason we have failed to find the proper course for this Organization should be sought in our indefinite and exaggerated appraisal of its historic role. Sometimes we have insisted on considering the United Nations as a panacea for all ills, as our universal savior. At other times we have tried to reduce it to a forum for the discussion of minor issues, a congress or seminar of modest technicians. Never have we tried to follow the middle course between exorbitant and chimerical ambition and sterile and selfish realism. Let us try to achieve realism and effectiveness within a framework of good faith.\n129.\tIt is of fundamental concern to us to achieve and preserve peace. By all possible means and from the very outset, Spain has been maintaining a consistent attitude of support for the idea of convening a conference on security and co-operation in Europe, which might serve as a useful instrument for the creation of a new order, through the acceptance of formal commitments, on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of all European States.\n130.\tThe ratification of the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties, the signature of the final protocol on Berlin and the agreements signed by President Nixon during his visit to Moscow permit us to set out on the preparatory multilateral phase of the conference, in which we shall be present and animated by the utmost desire to co-operate. In this phase and in the conference itself, Spain will make every effort to ensure that the agreement which seems to be dawning on the items with which we are dealing now, with our gaze fixed on the idea of encouraging a relaxation of tension in Europe and creating conditions of true peace and co-operation in economic, scientific and cultural spheres, will be worked out.\n131.\tAs a result of this agreement, we should study the related problem of the reduction of armed forces, within the world context, looking particularly at the Mediterranean. There would be no sense in reducing tension in one geographic region in order to raise it in others.\n132.\tFor some time now heightened tension in the Mediterranean has led the riparian States to formulate an expression of the need to ensure that the system of security now obtaining in that area a balance based on mutual dissuasion between two super-Powers be supplemented through an agreement between the States whose shores are washed by this sea. We should try to grant the riparian States a growing participation in the determination of their own destiny, which is obviously the result of situations that they do not control and in whose formation they do not participate or participate to only an inadequate degree.\n133.\tSpain, a Mediterranean country, whose history is linked to the destiny of that ancient sea, accepts these ideas with the utmost interest and co-operates in creating self-awareness and intends to consider all initiatives which, with a sense of realism and the desire to turn them into facts, may emerge in this forum.\n134.\tIn the Middle East a very dangerous situation continues, a situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\". The international community must, through the United Nations, redouble its efforts so that an equitable and stable peace can be reached in the area through the application of Security Council resolution 242(1967), which will take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n135.\tSpain is a firm supporter of the peaceful settlement of international conflicts and repudiates the use of violence, whether it is used by States or by individuals or by national or international political organizations. But this just condemnation of violence will not be sufficient unless the causes are uprooted, unless we provide a remedy for the injustices and frustrations which engender it. Peace is not the absence of acts of violence but rather calm and order, and there can be no order when displaced populations do not see a clear future before them but see rather the shadows of a possible conflict or at all times their continued destiny as exiles.\n136.\tFrom this lofty rostrum a year ago [1949th meeting] we stated that we should give special attention to Jerusalem. Spain will give favorable consideration to any efforts which may be made along these lines. Ever since 1948 the Organization has sought to find a formula that would guarantee the inviolability of Jerusalem as a Holy City. It is urgent to work out such an arrangement through which Jerusalem would preserve its character and the different beliefs could be practiced in a system of freedom, equality, security and dignity.\n137.\tThe doctrine established by the United Nations on various occasions, with the support of the overwhelming majority, recognizes the right of Spain to the decolonization of Gibraltar, which, as long as it remains in the hands of the United Kingdom, is an anachronistic residue of a colonial policy which has no meaning in current times. I can inform this General Assembly that throughout this year the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom and I have held three full and frank conversations, which we intend to continue.\n138.\tThe Spanish Government hopes that the United Kingdom will understand the necessity for these conversations as quickly as possible to lead to a negotiated solution which will put an end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar and restore the territorial integrity of Spain while respecting the interests of the people of Gibraltar. Thus it would become possible, looking towards the future and not to the past, to have a new and lasting relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom based on friendship and co-operation within the framework of a united Europe.\n139.\tI should like to reiterate in my statement this year the interest that Spain has in the work being done by the expanded Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, which is preparing the updated law of the sea in terms of the mandate which it received from the General Assembly [resolution 2750 C (XXV)], taking into account the interests and rights of all the States of the international community and the new realities which the last decade has witnessed.\n140.\tMy Government is pleased that at the two sessions held by that Committee this year its work has progressed satisfactorily in terms of the importance of its task.\n141.\tThroughout its sessions the Committee on the sea-bed has confirmed the justice of the thesis which my country shares with many other countries concerning the legal regime of the territorial sea belonging to States, and specifically concerning the basic concept of innocent passage, a concept of universal interest to protect the security and the vital interests of each and every State. We are opposed to the discriminatory attempts to alter this concept to the detriment of the riparian States which border on certain straits. Any seaman can in good faith satisfy his legitimate interests by respecting the sovereign rights of the State in whose waters he is traveling. The alleged freedoms that some are now seeking are only strategic political demands which will be translated sooner or later into attempts against peace and security. They are therefore unacceptable to us.\n142.\tThe safeguarding of peace is the primary objective of this Organization. For the full realization of his destiny, man needs peace and freedom. He requires that his peace should not be threatened nor his freedom limited by insuperable obstacles. Of all these limitations, none is more unbearable than subjugation by terror.\n143.\tWhen we seem to be closer than ever to seeing ourselves freed from the domination to which we have been subjected by our physical environment, when we have available to us the means which enable us to push back the frontiers of disease, sorrow and death, a scourge of violence and terror is spreading throughout the world, actions carried out by man against man which should not be legitimized as a means of attaining what may well be noble goals.\n144.\tEverywhere we hear voices asking for an end to violence and terror. Spain, well aware of the value of peace, which we regained after decades of sterile convulsions, is ready to associate itself with others in the search for effective solutions which will do away with terrorism.\n145.\tThe hope and illusion that mankind will be saved from terror cannot blind us to such a degree that we cease to be realistic in appraising the difficulties which will confront us in finding appropriate means for achieving that goal. Areas of tension, ideological conflicts, struggles between groups and classes, persistent injustice, and the passion and intolerance they engender make it difficult to achieve the unanimous acceptance of the possible proposals for a solution. The eradication of these tensions, conflicts, struggles and injustices should be the ultimate goal of our activities. If these are not done away with, there will be no peace or freedom in the world.\n146.\tThe United Nations should take appropriate and effective measures at the international level to achieve the following objectives.\n147.\tFirst, it should formulate a definition of terrorism.\n148.\tSecondly, it should ensure that all States fill the existing gaps in their legislations to combat new forms of delinquency, not only by adjusting their domestic legislation, but also by accepting existing international conventions. Thus, when the hijacking of aircraft began, the great majority of countries realized that their penal codes did not contain a description of the crime of aerial hijacking. Even today there are many countries that still have not incorporated into their domestic legislation the agreements of Tokyo, The Hague and Montreal,  and it seems to me inadmissible that we should agree to a situation in which day by day it is made more humiliating for passengers to accept some improvised security measures and which gives aircraft crews the impression- that we do not adequately value the high responsibility of their profession.\n149.\tThirdly, at the same time we should succeed in working out regional and sectoral agreements for the prevention and punishment of terrorism.\n150.\tFourthly, we should discuss a draft international convention or conventions which at the world level would contain the necessary means for putting an end to this plague which afflicts us today.\n151.\tTerrorism is a fresh challenge to our will to act. Calmly but with firmness and urgency we must confront that challenge. Let us not convert the suffering of so many people into rhetoric or propaganda. Let us return to suffering mankind its dignity and freedom and men will again place their hopes in and turn their eyes to our Organization.\n152.\tOne of the most important developments this year in the field of international co-operation has been, beyond question, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which was held in Stockholm last June. It implies that there is a formal awareness on the part of the international community of a series of almost new problems in the life of mankind. We are dealing here with serious threats which affect us all equally. This latter point should be emphasized: it is not valid for each of our countries to feel that it is protected because it stands at a greater distance in time or space from this or that specific polluting agent or from this or that specific process of the degradation of nature. In a \\\"compact world\\\" such as is rapidly emerging before our eyes the reality of our immediate natural environment is already rigorously unitary and in the common endeavor to protect it, either we all act by common accord and effectively or we shall hurl ourselves in the course of a few decades into a disastrous situation.\n153.\tThe Spanish Government is fully aware of this problem. We are aware of it domestically, where a process of industrialization carried out over a brief span of time, a deep-rooted social transformation and the rapid urbanization of areas and populations that were by tradition rural are constantly creating problems of changes in ecological balances which had been unchanged for centuries and the restoration of which, within the new and more lofty demands of the population, should be provided for as far as possible. Without going into the details of the principal measures we have been taking in recent years, I shall merely say that in terms of institutions we created this year a delegated commission of the Government, made up of 14 ministers, which co-ordinates all the legislative and governmental action relating to the defense of nature and the environment, Very advanced legislation in this field is in the stage of final drafting, and we hope that it will serve immediately as a guide-line for administrative action at all levels.\n154.\tThe immediate concern of the Spanish Government is directed towards common action for the defense of the natural environment of the Mediterranean. This area is subject today to a process of continuing degradation of nature, which is of deep concern to all the riparian States. As we fully share this concern, Spain has undertaken or is participating in various regional activities to improve our knowledge of the problem and to seek practical solutions. Among other efforts, I shall only mention the convening of a congress on ecology and tourism in the western Mediterranean, which will be held in Madrid early next November, and the proposal presented by Spain to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] for the realization of a pilot project on the Mediterranean region, which is the object of intense attention at the national level and which will be carried out in collaboration with the remaining riparian countries of OECD on the Mediterranean.\n155.\tA large Spanish delegation, which included all the affected sectors of the life of our country, was present at the third session of UNCTAD that was held in Santiago, Chile, from 13 April to 21 May of this year. I should like particularly to emphasize the wise decision taken by UNCTAD to enlarge the Trade and Development Board, and the belief that this body, since it will be more representative, will be able to cope with the vast tasks that are entrusted to it with better guarantees of success.\n156.\tIf we should like to draw up an assessment of the third session of UNCTAD, we would have to conclude that it has not lived up to all of the hopes that had been placed in it, but that none the less it has succeeded in strengthening the move of international public opinion towards co-operation in the settlement of these problems and at the same time in the adoption of a series of specific decisions which are also directed along these lines.\n157.\tIt is true that within the concept of under-development there are varying degrees and that there are pressing and urgent measures the adoption of which will admit of no delay. My country considers it wise to wish to single out the least advanced of the developing countries. We believe that the work done is praiseworthy, but we also believe that the criterion for classification followed heretofore may in some instances be considered inadequate and may leave out of this category certain Latin American countries whose needs are at least as pressing as those of some of the countries already included on the list. It is not only for reasons of brotherly ties but also because of an elementary concern for justice that we would hope that the aspirations of these countries will be taken into account.\n158.\tAs is known, Spain still has not reached a full measure of economic development. None the less, within the limits of our potential, we are making a notable effort to help countries which are less advanced than we are. This assistance is being rendered in the form of gifts, direct investment, export credits, dispatch of technicians and experts, fellowships, organization of lectures, seminars, and so on. This constant but quiet work of my country will be continued and increased, and we shall preferentially direct it towards those countries which for various reasons are specially close to our concerns.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me, first of all, to associate myself with the preceding speakers in extending the sincere and warm congratulations of the Mauritanian delegation on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The confidence unanimously shown in you by all States Members of the United Nations constitutes a deserved tribute to your talents and to your statesmanlike qualities and also striking proof of the esteem that the international community holds for your country, its people, and its distinguished leaders. In the accomplishment of your difficult but important mission, my delegation wishes to assure you of its entire and loyal co-operation.\n79.\tMy delegation also wishes to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, for the skill, impartiality and patience, and also for the subtlety, dedication and tact, he displayed in presiding over the long and difficult debates of the twenty-sixth session.\n80.\tI should also like to express to our Secretary-General our satisfaction with his efforts to help bring peace to the world and in particular with his eagerness to help the countries of the third world in their struggle to resolve their many problems. We are also following closely his initiatives in reorganizing the Secretariat out of a concern for efficacy and economy.\n81.\tWe are also particularly happy to see among us today the delegation of the People's Republic of China, whose presence in this hall we hail after a long wait. I should like to pay a tribute of admiration and sympathy to that delegation and to the great Chinese people. My delegation welcomes the presence of China, and I am happy to say so publicly and sincerely. We are convinced that the presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will contribute to the settlement of many problems confronting the Organization.\n82.\tDespite the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China, despite the elements of detente that have emerged in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the United States and China, the twenty-seventh session is meeting at a time when grave problems continue to threaten international peace and security.\n83.\tMurderous wars in the purest colonial style continue to rage in various parts of the world. The absence of any real will for general and complete disarmament and the disappointing results of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] are a matter of concern to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and to all countries that love peace and justice.\n84.\tThus, the African peoples continue to suffer under the savage yoke of Portuguese colonialism, aided by inter-national imperialism. To be sure, these people are organizing themselves and every day the national liberation movements of Guinea (Bissau) and the Cape Verde Islands, Mozambique and Angola, testify to their determination to fight to the end to bring down the illegal Portuguese rule.\n85.\tIn Zimbabwe, in South Africa, in Namibia, colonialism is compounded by the contemptible system of apartheid, which arbitrarily condemns the majority of the population to languish in moral and material wretchedness and permits the racist white minority to live with impunity on the natural and human resources of the majority.\n86.\tIt is high time that the international community took effective steps to put an end to this intolerable situation prevailing in southern Africa. The United Nations, if it is not to condemn itself for good, cannot fail to take up the continuous challenge thrown down to it by South Africa, Portugal and the racist regime of Rhodesia. No responsible country, no man of good faith, can feel free so long as millions of human beings remain deprived of their most elementary right to a life of freedom and dignity.\n87.\tSimilarly, international peace, security and concord can never validly be established so long as all peoples have not had recognized their inalienable rights to freedom, independence and dignity.\n88.\tConfronted with this extremely painful situation, imposed on our brothers in southern Africa by the colonialists and racists, with the effective support of international imperialism, my country would like once again forcefully to reaffirm its support and militant solidarity with our African brothers in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, in Mozambique, in Angola and in\nGuinea (Bissau), in their heroic struggle against injustice and arbitrary rule, for freedom, in peace and dignity.\n89.\tThis arduous but determined struggle will surely triumph despite the fanatic stubbornness of Portugal and the white minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia which refuse to look reality in the face while continuing to offer insolent defiance to the United Nations.\n90.\tBefore leaving decolonization, I should like to mention a final problem to which my country attaches special importance since it is of direct interest to ourselves. I refer to the question of the Sahara under Spanish rule.\n91.\tThis problem is indeed one of the major concerns of my Government since it is a problem which intimately and deeply affects the Mauritanian people. It concerns us by reason of every kind of tie-historical, geographical, human and cultural-which binds us to this part of the Sahara. It also affects us because between our people and the brother people of the Sahara there is more than one reason for common feeling, more than one link of solidarity and common life. It is precisely because of this common past, this community of life and destiny that my Government, back in 1957, made the decolonization of this north-west part of the Sahara one of the fundamental objectives of its policy, but decolonization in all friendship and cooperation with the administering Power. This policy, decided on immediately following the formation of the first Mauritanian Government still under the colonial regime, has always been ours and we have made it known constantly and consistently.\n92.\tSince our accession to independence and since our admission to the United Nations, we have never ceased, particularly from this rostrum, to make known our determination to safeguard the territorial integrity of our country and to consolidate the unity of our people. It is therefore for valid and legitimate reasons that independent Mauritania concerns itself and must concern itself primarily with the decolonization of the north-west part of the Sahara, known both as Rio de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra. But despite the legitimacy of our position, we have thought and continue to think that the settlement of this problem by peaceful means\u2014that is to say, in understanding and co-operation-remains the path most in conformity not only with the principles and purposes of the Charter, but also with the interests of peace and stability in the African north-west subregion. It is our loyalty to these principles and objectives and our devotion to peace which naturally impelled us to accept the prospect for a peaceful solution through the implementation of the United Nations resolutions concerning this territory. That is why we hope tjiat the Spanish Government, within the framework of the good relations, old and new, which bind our two countries, will at last implement, as it has undertaken to do, the relevant provisions of these resolutions. Such an attitude on the part of the Spanish Government would further strengthen the traditional friendship and the bonds of every kind which exist not only between Spain and Mauritania, but between Spain and each of the other countries in our north-west African subregion.\n93.\tFor it was in the framework of this quest for a peaceful solution that my country had the honor to receive at Nouadhibou, in September of 1970, His Majesty Hassan II and Houari Boumediene. The three heads of State, from Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, resolved to co-ordinate their efforts with a view to bringing Spain, through dialog, entente and co-operation, to implement the resolutions of the United Nations regarding the territory. As far as we are concerned, in Mauritania we remain true to the spirit of that conference of Nouadhibou and to the undertakings there entered into and we continue to believe that this attitude remains that of the other parties to the policy of co-operation and good neighborliness.\n94.\tIn other words, Spain, which in the past has conducted itself positively in the matter of decolonization, has every interest in heeding this spirit of understanding between the States of the subregion, and also in accepting the irreversible nature of the decolonization of the Sahara.\n95.\tThe continuance in Africa of this dangerous situation must not make us lose sight of another hotbed of tension, which is in the forefront of our concerns: namely, the Middle East crisis.\n96.\tIn the Middle East the Zionist authorities of Tel Aviv continue to trample underfoot the fundamental principles of the Charter and the decisions of our Organization. Their troops continue to enjoy the fruits of their cowardly aggression. The vast territories of the Arab Republic of Egypt, of the Syrian Arab Republic, of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, continue to suffer under the most barbaric military occupation. The criminal burning of the famous Al Aqsa mosque over two years ago aroused the indignation of almost all the world. This burning, for which the Zionist occupation authorities are entirely responsible, reminds the world of the very grave threat to the holy places of Islam, Christianity and Judaism represented by the completely illegal decision taken by the Zionist authorities regarding the annexation of the Arab part of the city of Jerusalem.\n97.\tMore than five years have elapsed since the Israeli aggression of June 1967. Since that date vast Arab territories have been occupied by an unscrupulous and inhumane army. The Arab population which has not been expelled is living an unendurable calvary. Houses are destroyed and fields are transformed into barracks or military bases. Colonies of Zionists are replacing Arab villages. A major campaign is under way in Europe and America to get the greatest possible number of Jewish immigrants to come and settle in the occupied Arab territories. This colonialist policy was denounced in Israel itself at a protest meeting-held at Kibbutz Kerem-Shalom, where it was emphasized that the Bedouin farmers had been expelled to make way for Jewish settlers. The writer- journalist Amos Kenan stated:\n\\\"We must stop using these euphemisms such as 'creation of Jewish agricultural agglomerations' when the correct term is 'colonization'.\\\"\nHe continued:\n\\\"If we want to stop the growth of this colonialist, militarist and Pharisaical Israel that we see taking form before our eyes, we must here and now declare to the\nleaders of our country that we will not fight in the next war which they are preparing with their own hands.\\\"\nI repeat: this was not an Arab speaking; it was a distinguished Jewish writer and journalist, Amos Kenan.\n98.\tFurthermore, in support of what Amos Kenan said, a member of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, Mrs. Shulamit Aloni, wrote the following in an article in Yediot Aharonot on 18 April 1972:\n\\\"... Jewish farmers newly installed in the Gaza zone are employing in the fields Bedouins expelled from their lands.\\\"\nShe concluded: \\\". .. here we are confronted with a colonialist-type annexation\\\".\n99.\tThe barbarous action of the Israeli army is not confined to those violations of the jus gentium; on the contrary, Israel is still daily violating the air space of neighboring Arab countries. Its naval units regularly bombard peaceful Arab villages, killing innocent civilians. Its incursions across frontiers of this or that neighboring Arab country have become art everyday practice. This situation constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of justice, equality and territorial integrity of States and absolute respect for their sovereignty principles which are the life-blood of our Organization.\n100.\tEveryone in this hall now knows that for the Zionists of Israel principles have no value except in so far as they can use them in the interest of their dark designs. If the authorities of Tel Aviv had the least respect for principles they would have applied the pertinent General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the Middle East question, particularly Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which they have nevertheless accepted. If the Tel Aviv authorities had the least respect for principles they would have co-operated with and assisted in the smooth functioning of Ambassador Jarring's mission instead of blocking it. If the authorities of Tel Aviv had the least respect for principles they would have accepted the mediation of the 10 members of the Committee of African Heads of State, members of a committee appointed by the OAU and chaired by the Head of State of Mauritania, then President of the OAU. If the authorities of Tel Aviv had the least respect for principles they would have permitted the United Nations commission appointed to investigate the lot of Arab prisoners to do its job.\n101.\tIt is clear to us all that Israel has the utmost contempt for the United Nations. As we have seen, Israel remains deaf to all appeals and all memoranda. Today the international community can no longer doubt that this state of affairs exist. Confronted with this situation, the international community must do everything possible to impel Israel, in the interests of international peace and security, to implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)-the only way of definitively and peacefully solving the question of the Middle East.\n102.\tThe legitimate liberation struggle carried on by the Palestinian people to recover their usurped homeland enjoys the active support of Mauritania and all peoples who love freedom and justice. The courage and self-sacrifice of the valiant Palestinian people, which is carrying on the liberation struggle in extremely difficult conditions, merit the admiration and encouragement of the international community. For too long there has been a desire to ignore the Palestinian people and to reduce them to inhabitants of refugee camps. Today they exist and are organized as a dynamic and embattled liberation movement. They are on their feet, weapons in hand, and have taken charge of their destiny. Henceforth it will therefore be futile to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict without their essential participation.\n103.\tNo authority-whatever it may be-is empowered to speak or deal on behalf of the Palestinian people. This responsibility will henceforth be incumbent on the liberation organization of Palestine alone.\n104.\tIn his speech to the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Mauritanian Head of State said:\n\\\"We all know that a final and durable solution cannot be found, whether voluntarily or not, if the Palestinian people are put into brackets. We must also cease using euphemisms and referring coyly to 'refugees'. The Palestinian people, chased from their lands by the Zionists who have taken over those lands by force, has a right to its existence. That people does exist even if this fundamental right, enshrined in the Charter which governs our life, is denied it. The Palestinian people, therefore, is courageously waging its fight for national liberation and refuses the role of accepting international charity and living in camps. There is no doubt whatever that its cause will triumph. Therefore, wisdom and realism demand that we should hasten the realization of that goal, which is inevitable and which will put an end to misery, bereavement, suffering and death, and bring about the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people.\\\" [1877th meeting, para. 13. J\nThere is the only realistic solution, the only wise solution to the Palestinian tragedy. Any other approach will be doomed to failure. The Zionists must be convinced of this.\n105.\tIn a recent book Le pays du cerf, edited by Am Oved, Deputy Arie Eliat, member of the leadership of the Labour Party the Party in power draws up the most complete and most damning indictment of the official line, as follows:\n\\\"An attempt to ignore this problem is vain, since it is impossible to pass over in silence such a tragedy, both human and national...; the Palestinian problem is at the source of the conflict; it is the root of the evil which has given rise to the Jewish-Arab hostilities. It is a festering and bleeding wound, from which their blood and ours flows.\\\"\nEliat adds: \\\"There will be no real peace, no end to the Israel-Arab conflict, until the Palestinian problem is solved.\\\"\n106.\tThe Palestinian liberation movement, like any other liberation movement throughout the world, will continue by every means at its disposal the struggle imposed upon it, until it has recovered all its rights. The attempts of the\nZionists and their accomplices to alienate from that movement the sympathy of Western public opinion will not weaken its resolve; quite the contrary.\n107.\tAll those not blinded by racism and by the taste for domination, all those who believe in equality and fraternity among men, in the right of peoples to self-determination and to live in freedom, all those who cherish peace, all those who reject oppression and the law of the stronger, all those who are aware of the crimes that have been committed and are still being committed by the Israeli Zionists against the Palestinian people, all those will understand that the Palestinian patriots are completely\n' different from the image that the militarist Zionists of Israel give of them.\n108.\tThe terms \\\"terrorist\\\" and \\\"saboteur\\\" now used to describe those who are struggling in Africa and the Middle East for the independence of their countries and the dignity of their peoples cannot distort the reality they conceal. That is also the view of Deputy Arie Eliat, a member of Mrs. Meir's governing party. Eliat protests against those who describe the Palestinian fighters as \\\"bands of terrorists\\\" and he writes:\n\\\"Israel should not ignore or underestimate the Palestinian armed resistance ... It must no longer under-estimate the morale and the courage of the Palestinian organizations...\\\"\nAnd the author adds: \\\"... the Palestinian Arabs are our fiercest enemies, but that is no reason for not calling them by their name . ..\\\"\n109.\tThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania cannot but be indignant at the taking of innocent human lives, but it has the right and the duty to say that those who are truly responsible for such acts are those who, by their policy of domination and intolerance, by their policy of the massacre of civilian populations, the destruction of peaceful villages and the kidnapping of persons, those who by their policy of racism and colonialism lead peoples to despair and violence.\n110.\tThe United Nations, if it is to be realistic and consistent, must root out the evil or face the consequences.\n111.\tThis tragic and dangerous situation in Africa and in the Middle East must not make us forget the extremely grave situation prevailing in South-east Asia, where the peoples of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos are carrying on, with a determination never belied and a courage never equaled, a heroic struggle to secure respect for their sacred right to an independent, free and worthy life.\n112.\tDespite the Paris negotiations and the hopes they have aroused, the Viet-Nam war becomes daily more barbaric, more murderous. The mining of the ports of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the stepping up of the indiscriminate bombing of its territory constitute a particularly grave escalation in the war which the United States is waging against the industrious Vietnamese people.\n113.\tConfronted by this situation, in which a small people is in danger of being annihilated by the greatest Power in the world, which insists upon trying at all costs to impose its will on that people, the international community has the urgent duty to do everything possible to put an end to the war so that the people of Viet-Nam may at last live in peace.\n114.\tHowever, peace will never be effective until the American troops and those of other foreign countries have accepted the peace proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in its statement of 11 September 1972.\n115.\tI take particular pleasure here in reiterating to the valiant people of Viet-Nam the unreserved support and militant solidarity of the party, Government and people of Mauritania. We would like to take this opportunity of expressing our deep conviction that its just cause will inevitably triumph over all the obstacles in the path to its independence and freedom.\n116.\tOur unfailing and unreserved support and solidarity go also to the people and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in the courageous and self-sacrificing struggle they are waging for the dignity and freedom of man in Viet-Nam.\n117.\tThe situation in Cambodia deserves, as much as any other, the attention of the international community.\n118.\tIn that country, foreign forces are obstinately op-posing the aspirations of the valiant and peaceful Khmer people, struggling for the triumph of their noble ideals of peace, justice, freedom and dignity.\n119.\tThe Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, under the enlightened leadership of Prince Sihanouk, today controls over 80 per cent of the territory and the population of the country. It ought to have been possible to liberate the rest of the country by now, had it not been for the foreign forces in the country. Therefore, anyone can see where legitimacy lies, and who represents the will and aspirations of, if not the whole, then at least the over-whelming majority of the Khmer people.\n120.\tThe international community should draw the necessary lesson from this incontestable reality. For our part, we should like once again to assure the people and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia of our unfailing support and entire solidarity, at the same time expressing our deep conviction that their just struggle will surely triumph.\n121.\tIn regard to Korea, my country welcomes recent developments in relations between the South and the North of the country and earnestly hopes that the contacts already made will continue and will result in the peaceful reunification of the country. Nevertheless, it is clear that such reunification, so eagerly awaited by every Korean and by all who love peace and justice, is the exclusive concern of the Koreans themselves and, consequently can only be validly achieved after the cessation of all foreign interference in the affairs of Korea.\n122.\tThe United Nations has the right, and above all the duty, to assist in the course of the present session in creating conditions favorable for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. Independent reunification means without any foreign intervention, but peaceful reunification also through the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea, whose presence is not likely to create a peaceful climate in which the talks now taking place between the two parties can usefully proceed.\n123.\tIt was the duty of the General Assembly for it had the right and the opportunity, at this session-to help remove all the obstacles to the essential reunification of Korea. It could, at this session, have decided that the flag of the United Nations should no longer be used to camouflage the presence of foreign occupation troops in Korea. It could also have re-examined the mandate and the activities of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, since it is now clear that that Commission, far from promoting rapprochement, is a divisive element and also represents a heavy and unnecessary burden on the Organization's budget.\n124.\tIt is therefore exceedingly regrettable that the General Assembly has decided to postpone consideration of this important question of Korea to a later session. My delegation deeply regrets that the* General Assembly did not take the opportunity offered to it of contributing to the solution of a painful problem whose existence is due essentially to political and military intervention by the United Nations.\n125.\tThe concerns of my delegation are not confined to the grave problems I have just mentioned; far from it. We think that the problem of disarmament is very urgent, and its importance escapes no member of our Organization. The stockpiling and further improvement of weapons of mass destruction represent a grave danger to development and even to the survival of mankind. The vast sums devoted to armaments dangerously reduce the investments available for the economic and social progress of the developing countries. My delegation, for its part, will therefore support any international effort to bring about genuine general and complete disarmament.\n126.\tIf the grave problems I have mentioned are important, since they bear in themselves the seeds of conflict and therefore directly threaten international peace and security, if those grave problems require our attention and the search for solutions in conformity with the principles and purposes of our Charter and the aspirations of peoples, there are others, too, which must also be the object of our concern.\n127.\tMy delegation finds it impossible indeed to address this Assembly without referring to the grave economic and social problems with which the developing countries tragically find themselves confronted. It is regrettable that, on this fundamental level of mutual assistance which should characterize relations between peoples and nations, the co-operation of the wealthy countries is cruelly lacking.\n128.\tThe disappointing results of the third session of UNCTAD, the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade, the decision-making monopoly held by certain developed countries as regards the international monetary system-all this testifies to the absence of a political will to take the necessary measures to establish, in the interest of all Members, a genuine international economic co-operation profitable to all.\n129.\tIn such circumstances, with fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and constant increase in the prices of manufactured products, the already scandalous gap is continually widening.\n130.\tOur Organization has the duty to redouble its efforts and to ensure that the rivalry among the great Powers is confined to the peaceful and elevating field of scientific research in the service of improving the lot of mankind.\n131.\tAs has been emphasized from this rostrum, close to $200,000 million are spent annually on armaments, whereas the flow of capital from the rich countries to the poor barely amounts to $10,000 million. This is a scandalous disparity that should not be tolerated in our day and age.\n132.\tFor its part, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is convinced that no country can truly triumph over under-development without having a vigorous grasp of the truly gigantic efforts and sacrifices required of both the nation and the individual.\n133.\tThat is why from this rostrum we wish to say that we are fully aware of the necessity of bilateral and multilateral assistance, but no less aware that we must first of all count on ourselves before counting on others. In this regard, Mauritania believes that the countries of the third world must not allow themselves to take the easy but dangerous way out, that of looking to foreign assistance for everything.\n134.\tThe industrialized countries, in both their own long-term interest and that of mankind as a whole, of course have the duty to work out a genuine international economic co-operation that would serve as a base for peace and understanding among peoples, and also as a powerful factor for a real implementation of the rights of man, whoever and wherever he may be. But as we have just said, such co-operation must be accompanied on our part by an awareness of the obligations of work and sacrifice.\n135.\tWith regard to the continent of Africa, the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania see in the rallying of countries around common objectives a potent means for speedily advancing their economic growth. We believe, therefore, in the usefulness of groupings at the subregional, regional and continental levels. Such groupings, through the markets they create, through the opportunity they provide for the member States to harmonize their development plans, represent an adaptable and useful framework the creation of which deserves to be encouraged by the United Nations. Such activity is perfectly consistent with the social and economic programs of our Organization.\n136.\tReference to the political and economic difficulties and the conflicts that sometimes darken the international horizon should not cause us to forget the positive role played by our Organization in the restoration and maintenance of peace in the world.\n137.\tWe express the sincere hope that we may see every Member State work for respect for the principles of the Charter and for application of the decisions taken by our Organization. Thus there will be a rebirth of the confidence now somewhat shaken-of peoples in this world Organization, for the greater good of all humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "The Republic of Haiti takes particular satisfaction in extending its warm congratulations to Mr. Trepczynski on his election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n127.\tWe were happy to contribute to his election, recalling the significant gesture of the Polish battalion which, arriving in the colony of Santo Domingo with a Napoleonic expedition under the orders of General Leclerc, refused to bear arms against the Negroes of Haiti, who were fighting fiercely for their freedom and independence. To applaud this lofty sense of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the Founder of the world's' First Black Republic, forthwith conferred Haitian nationality on the Polish soldiers, who subsequently were among the most ardent defenders of their adopted fatherland.\n128.\tThis historic memory, dear to the heart of all Haitians, sufficiently expresses the pride the Haitian delegation takes in offering the President its most loyal cooperation for the success of his mandate.\n129.\tI should also like to hail the President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly who, despite numerous difficulties, managed with competence and tact to carry out his delicate mission to the satisfaction of the Members of the Organization.\n130.\tI am speaking on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Jean- Claude Duvalier, President-for-life of the Republic, and of his Government, when I address my most earnest thanks to the members of the General Assembly for the support they offered the Haitian candidate for one of the vice- presidencies of the General Assembly. We see this gesture as a token of appreciation of the ceaseless efforts of the Government of the Republic to improve the living conditions of our people while contributing to the maintenance of a climate of peace, harmony and understanding in the Caribbean.\n131.\tAs we begin the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly under the aegis of the great principles which, immediately following the last war, brought together men and nations in a single surge of brotherhood, the world is darkened by the Viet-Nam war, which continues in blood, horror and destruction; the armed conflict between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, which has inflamed a large part of Africa and is threatening the equilibrium of the continent; the Middle East, where the atmosphere remains explosive while a wave of terrorism is spreading over the world: kidnapping, assassinations, hijackings of aircraft, attacks against persons and property, sequestrations, blackmail with hostages. Terrorism itself leads to counter-terrorism and murderous acts provoke reprisals of the same kind in other words, terror is met with terror. There is an uninterrupted chain of victims which stretches from Lod Airport to the Olympic Games in Munich, to the villages burned in Lebanon and practically to all continents.\n132.\tIf these acts have a more immediate impact on the conscience of mankind and underscore the responsibility of each State of the international community, they must not be allowed to obscure the drama of the large majority of the world's population, which is deeply marked by poverty, undernourishment, unemployment, ignorance and sickness.\n133.\tThe problem of development, which is closely bound up with the independence of Latin America, has assumed new dimensions with the emancipation of the colonial peoples and has become a demand of the poor countries. The initial phase of piecemeal struggle against the major economic Powers has given way to a sense of solidarity, of common destiny, among the disinherited peoples; to an awareness of the identity of the problems and a more realistic grasp of under-development; an awareness of the need to present a united front in the defense of essential interests, thus emphasizing the weight of the third world in the destiny of our earth. How many distinguished voices have been raised in the defense of this cause! \\\"The price of primary commodities, above all that of coffee, copper, cocoa and sisal, continues to decline on the international market, whereas at the same time the cost of manufactured products constantly rises\\\", wrote Dr. Francois Duvalier in 1969. The assistance granted by international organizations is proving to be parsimonious and insufficient in the face of the agonizing problems of development confronting Governments and peoples. These disenchanted considerations of a statesman were echoed three years later at the session of UNCTAD held in Santiago, Chile.\n134.\tThe inadequacy of action undertaken in the field of trade and aid policy derives from the attitude of the developed countries, which are preoccupied by the complexity of their own problems: spiraling inflation, pollution, arms policy tied to the will-to-power. And it must be recognized that the rate of transfer of know-how and capital necessary for the third world's economic and social development is proving clearly insufficient.\n135.\tIn fact, the third world's economic and technological dependence on the great Powers is becoming more and more marked in the twentieth century.\n136.\tThe international community is still confronted with the task of giving practical expression to new trade and aid policies, of finding reasonable solutions to the growing indebtedness of the under-developed countries, of offsetting the burden of debt servicing and its impact on development efforts. No agreement has been forthcoming to date on the vital question for the countries of the third world of preferential access to the markets of the industrialized countries, or on the diversification of agricultural production tied to an increasing volume of assistance. Nevertheless, there are certain things on the plus side: the recognition of the developing countries' right to participate in any reform of the international monetary system, the recognition of the necessity for a transfer of technology to the nations of the third world, and the drafting of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States.\n137.\tIn Latin America, in Africa and in Asia the voices of many millions of men are being upraised to claim the right to education, health and happiness. They look to the Second United Nations Development Decade to improve their living conditions.\n138.\tThose who bear the responsibility for the world's destiny must surely be aware that the urgent problems of economic development and disequilibrium between nations and between different social groups within nations are a source of chronic tension and one of the greater threats to peace. With the ever-widening gap between the industrialized and the under-developed countries, a feeling of frustration and despair is overtaking the disinherited of the earth. The moral argument, as well as the clearly understood interest of peoples that are guided by a sense of the future, point to the need to adapt economic and political structures to the new requirements of contemporary thinking while remaining true to the principles of law and solidarity of the United Nations Charter.\n139.\tIt is with bitter disappointment that the Republic of Haiti notes that 1971, proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations as \\\"The International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination\\\" [resolution 2544 (XXIV)], has passed without any effective measure being taken to eliminate these brazen practices in South Africa and Rhodesia.\n140.\tThe United Nations Charter proclaims the fundamental rights of man, the dignity and worth of the human being, the equality of rights of men and women as well as of nations great and small. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights goes further, recalling that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\n141.\tYet, since 1946 the General Assembly has had before it the case of South Africa, where the majority of the people are oppressed by a minority oh the ground of supposed racial superiority. Yet racism persists with its inevitable genocidal component and threatens to become, as former Secretary-General U Thant wrote, a hideous monster ready to devour everything beneficial mankind has thus far succeeded in achieving and of reducing men to a bestial level of hatred and intolerance.\n142.\tTo extirpate this virus of racial discrimination, which is tirelessly eroding the international community, means harnessing the progress of science and technology, which are irresistibly drawing humanity towards a universal civilization that will destroy backward and outdated particularisms. It means accepting and respecting the diversity of men in the complexity of their cultural and social- political evolution. It means struggling for social, economic and political justice, for equality of opportunity and for a brotherhood which will guarantee the dignity of man and the effective exercise of his rights.\n143.\tFor, when all is said and done, we must realize that racial discrimination does not result primarily from mistaken notions, but is rather an ideological mask for more real conflicts based on the will to enslave and on relations of force. In other words, racism is one of the most abhorrent and degrading vestiges of colonialism, which, unfortunately, mankind has not yet extirpated, despite the profound changes which have taken place since the Second World War.\n144.\tThe Republic of Haiti reaffirms the urgency of measures both national and international to implement the instruments of the United Nations aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in order to foster harmonious relations among all races.\n145.\tThe General Assembly, and the Security Council in its resolution 310 (1972), have already condemned this year the refusal of South Africa to withdraw from Namibia. It is urgent that the Secretary-General, in conformity with Council resolution 309 (1972) should be authorized to contact the interested parties so that the Namibian people may freely exercise its right to self-determination and independence.\n146.\tThe ethnic and cultural ties that bind the Republic of Haiti to Africa make us still more sympathetic to the desperate lot of those peoples. The delegation of Haiti appeals to the conscience of all Members of the Organization to demand respect for the resolutions and the fundamental principles of the Charter.\n147.\tUpon the inauguration of the proceedings of this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, your spontaneous choice of the Republic of Haiti to occupy one of the vice-presidencies of the Organization, testifying to delegations' appreciation, and sympathy vis-a-vis the Government of our President-for-life, Jean-Claude Duvalier, stimulates our efforts, strengthens our faith in the glorious destiny of our fatherland and encourages us to do still more to assist the United Nations to discharge its delicate and important mission.\n148.\tAlmost 18 months ago President Duvalier inaugurated a new international policy based on peace and international co-operation, in respect for the principles of non-intervention, self-determination and the inalienable right of peoples freely to decide their destiny.\n149.\tThe particular and close ties that history and geography have forged over the centuries between our country and the Dominican Republic explain wV' we should have looked first to that country. The converse ions which took place both in port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo have created a climate of confidence and harmony which took practical form in agreements on cultural exchange, while new economic and trade conventions are now being negotiated by experts of the two countries. Their signature will reaffirm the bonds already existing between the two States and at the same time help to strengthen their political stability. The Republic of Haiti invites all the peoples of the Caribbean ardently struggling to better themselves at this crossroads of races and civilizations to join in this co-operation for the full flowering of our rich potentials.\n150.\tIn March of this year a Haitian good-will mission left for Washington, where it set forth the main lines of the policy of social justice of its Government, of progressive harmonization of interests of different sectors. At the State Department, at the Pentagon, the Haitian plenipotentiaries were received with warmth, and with their American counterparts laid the basis for a new era of co-operation between these two oldest independent republics of our hemisphere. In return, representatives of the Agency for International Development and an American military mission came to Port-au-Prince to discuss practical conditions for collaboration between the two Governments in the fields of the economy, arms, and technical assistance.\n151.\tAt the same time the deep linguistic and cultural affinities between Haiti and France, which go back more than three centuries and which found such happy expression in the brilliant intellectual qualities of Dr. Francis Duvalier, encouraged a rapprochement between France and Haiti at a time when the policies of the late General de Gaulle, seeking to restore to France its place in the world, were bearing fruit. There was an important exchange of letters between Presidents Jean-Claude Duvalier and Georges Pompidou. At the invitation of the French Government a sizable Haitian mission went to Paris for talks on economic and financial matters and signed a specific agreement for the development in Haiti of French cultural and technical co-operation services. In the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Israel and Lebanon, this same delegation continued its cordial talks that promise much for the future of our relations with these friendly countries.\n152.\tVis-a-vis Latin America, President Duvalier has adopted a policy of openness and understanding inspired by our highest pan-American traditions. The misunderstandings and misinterpretations perpetuated by factions blinded by their own interests, wealth and privileges and, insensible to the physical and moral sufferings of the great majority of the people, were thus dispelled. The humanitarian nature of the Duvalierist revolution, the strength of its ideology which has aroused in the nation psychological stimuli capable of engendering the hope, energy and enthusiasm that are essential to the effort for a new start-this Christian revolution, as was attested by the happy negotiations with the Holy See-was presented in its true light. The nobility of its purpose in seeking to improve the human lot in Haiti was properly understood.\n153.\tIn December 1971, the Republic of Haiti resumed diplomatic and consular relations with Costa Rica; in April 1972 with Ecuador; and on 8 June of that same year with Venezuela, to which we are bound by fraternal relations which go back to the time when Bolivar was struggling for the independence of Latin America.\n154.\tThus, less than two years after his inauguration, President Jean-Claude Duvalier has given, in the concern for the honor and dignity of his country, a dynamic impetus to the pan-Americanism of which Haiti was the cradle.\n155.\tSince the object of all international co-operation, as of all development policies, remains the human being and the satisfaction of his needs, both physical and moral, the Government of the Republic of Haiti has resolutely pursued the establishment of a national infrastructure, the construction of roads, schools, dispensaries and hospitals; with the Francois Duvalier hydro-electric plant at Peligre the production of electric power has been doubled. New channels of co-operation have been opened with the international finance agencies: the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. To illustrate these new relations, I shall simply mention the latest loan of $10 million granted by the World Bank to help improve our drinking water supply.\n156.\tThanks to this political stability that only the confidence and the dedication of the people can maintain, a favorable climate has been created for private investment, tourist complexes, hotels, the development of beaches, factories, and sugar plants. All the parameters of the Haitian economy confirm this improvement, this renaissance, the fruit and the result of our revolution of social justice.\n157.\tThe policy of openness, reconciliation and entente that President Duvalier inaugurated, holding out the hand of friendship to erstwhile adversaries and enemies, is reflected in the return home of former diplomats, parliamentarians, politicians and soldiers, where they are freely going about their business under the protection of the law and administrative authority.\n158.\tThe explosive nature in the situation in the Middle East is now evident to us all. From the war in Sinai, to the Six-Day War, from the bloody days of Munich, which stripped the Olympic Games of their symbolism of peace, to the reprisals against towns in Syria and Lebanon, the conflict is going beyond the Middle East and a bewildered world is now asking itself where this chain of passions and violence will stop.\n159.\tFor five years now Ambassador Gunnar Jarring has been working with zeal and dedication in the quest for a practical solution within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Faced with this situation, which is developing so dangerously and in which certain great Powers dream of satisfying their ancient dream of hegemony, in the face of this crisis where alliances, misunderstandings and ruptures succeed one another, it is necessary to appeal to the wisdom and comprehension of the parties concerned, and thus to spare the civil populations and war prisoners further suffering. Is there no other way but war, between the resolve of the Arab countries to force the Israelis to abandon the occupied territories and Israel's determination to seek safety within secure frontiers? In any event, it is certain that the escalation of violence leads nowhere.\n160.\tA resolute champion of peace, the Haitian Government, as President Jean-Claude Duvalier has said, supports the theory of secure frontiers for all States including Israel. If they did not feel for ever hostages to a past marked by struggle, hatred and confrontation, the two parties could undertake, under the aegis of our Organization, a constructive dialog which could lead to peaceful coexistence and which would meet the wishes of all men of goodwill.\n161.\tWould it not be a good thing-and this is the wish of the Republic of Haiti -at this time, when the unhappy peoples of the Middle East are chafing at the fate that condemns them to a state of war, exhausts economic resources and prevents the flourishing of any social life, for the United Nations to intervene and revive the Jarring mission so as to advance the cause of peace and encourage the parties to re-examine the problem with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution of the conflict?\n162.\tIt was in this same spirit of dialog and in the conviction of the desirability of bilateral conversations that our delegation noted the new relations between South and North Korea. At this stage of the negotiations, which hold out hope for a happy outcome, the Government of Haiti considers that public debates based on ideological opposition would risk closing the way to the necessary reciprocal concessions and provoke a hardening of positions. Therefore, my delegation is in favor of the proposal that the two parties should be left free to carry on their bilateral conversations in a spirit of mutual understanding derived from their common origin. In the light of these considerations, the Republic of Haiti is absolutely in agreement that the question of Korea should be postponed to the next session of the General Assembly.\n163.\tThe Government of Haiti has also followed with keen interest the new Ostpolitik of the Federal Republic of Germany and the initiation of new East-West contacts in Europe with a view to restoring the peace, reconciliation and fraternity of sports of which Chancellor Willy Brandt had hoped to make Munich the symbol. The Moscow Treaty, the recognition of the Oder-Neisse frontier between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the complementary arrangements are all positive steps in this policy, at the same time as the continuance of conversations between the two Germanys for the normalization of their relations.\n164.\tThe United Nations can achieve its universal vocation only with the representation of all nations that make up the international community. Ideological conflicts bound up with political rivalries have thus far kept outside it human entities which have displayed their vitality in the building of modern civilization. This seems to be the case with the two German States, whose admission to this Organization the Assembly may be led to consider at this session. The admission of one to the detriment of the other would, we believe, be no solution to the problem. On the contrary, it would tend to widen still further the gap between these two States and would impede progress towards a satisfactory solution of the German problem. What the United Nations needs is less a broad range of State delegations than a continuous determination, constantly renewed, on the part of its Members, to COP tribute to the welfare of agonized humanity. The delegation of the Republic of Haiti believes that it would be a good idea to postpone consideration of the admission to the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic until such time as the parties directly concerned have found adequate solutions to the problems that have arisen from the division of Germany.\n165.\tIn the struggle of the peoples of the third world for better living conditions, the sea and the immense riches it contains have aroused new hopes. In this regard one may rightly recall the importance of the decision taken within the strict framework of their sovereignty by most countries of Latin America, which have fixed the limit of their territorial waters at 200 nautical miles.\n166.\tAt the initiative of Venezuela, almost all the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, including the Republic of Haiti, met at Caracas in order in the spirit of Bolivar -that is to say, of pride, independence and pan- American solidarity- to consider the problems of the law of the sea, scientific investigations into the natural resources of the sea and the sea-bed and technological co-operation in that zone, taking into account the geographical characteristics of the region. The idea was to review the possibilities of exploiting the biological and mineral resources of the Caribbean sea, of deep drilling and also of guaranteeing the common and specific interests of the coastal countries.\n167.\tIn June 1972 the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on the Problems of the Sea met at Santo Domingo. The participants, while underlining the urgent economic needs of the peoples of the region, stressed the fact that the renewable and non-renewable resources of the sea help to raise the living standards of the developing countries and to stimulate and accelerate their progress. They also pointed out that the maritime resources are not inexhaustible, because even living species can decline or disappear as a result of irrational exploitation or contamination. The essential points of the conclusions of that Conference, called upon to play a certain role in the development of the Caribbean countries and in their mutual relations, specified that all States had a right to fix their territorial waters at the limit of 12 nautical miles measured from the base line. Furthermore, the coastal States should exercise the rights of sovereignty over the natural resources, renewable or non-renewable, located both within the patrimonial sea and on the continental shelf, that is to say, the sea-bed and the subsoil of the submarine zones adjacent to the shore, or to a total distance of 200 nautical miles from the shore line. These conclusions, to which the Republic of Haiti fully adheres, respect the maritime interests of the international community and the regime of the high seas and the sea-bed, which are part of the common heritage of mankind. Thus, the countries of the Caribbean are demonstrating that economic and technological co-operation are possible and essential between under-developed peoples. They offer this example to the brother countries of the third world and emphasize the immense unexploited riches which are to be found in their local seas and which could powerfully contribute to their economic development and the strengthening of their independence.\n168.\tIt must be recognized that among the problems of concern to mankind that of disarmament is one of the most important and most agonizing. Despite the reiterated appeals of the General Assembly, the arms race, which threatens the world with the specter of a nuclear war that could destroy all life on the planet, is continuing. We note with concern that the nuclear Powers are continuing indefinitely to strengthen their military arsenals, while others are engaging in nuclear and thermonuclear tests, in the atmosphere and underground, the better to enhance the destructive power of the atom.\n169.\tThe United Nations should intervene decisively to put an end to this insane competition, which is a serious threat to world peace and which is swallowing up considerable resources in order to maintain what is known as the \\\"balance of terror\\\". The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] the Moscow Agreement limiting anti-ballistic missile systems and strategic offensive weapons, signed in May, and the Tlatelolco Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America are among the initiatives which are to be encouraged and supported.\n170.\tIt is clear that all the money which is futilely spent on armaments could be used to attack the fundamental problem of our time, that of under-development.\n171.\tBilateral and multilateral co-operation would make it possible to restore a fairer balance in expenditures, which would certainly have a positive effect on terrorism and would help to strengthen peace, the peace which His Holiness Pope Paul VI thought would be possible only through \\\"generalized development\\\".\n172.\tTerrorism, which has now become an international issue, is a matter of growing concern everywhere. Violence, which used to be limited in character, thanks to modern communications, has now spread to almost all continents, and the situation is aggravated by the use of modern arms and technology. Going beyond mere individuals, terrorist groups are now setting up full-blown organizations. They have their agents and representatives in various cities; they have their budgets and their sources of arms supply. They know the addresses and habits of their victims; they know the times of arrival and departure of aircraft, and they are present at international meetings.\n173.\tThe political aspect of terrorism is complicated when it is associated with national, racial and ideological claims or with the struggle of guerrilla forces, or when it is the alleged last resort of those who are beset by poverty and have lost all hopes in national and international institutions.\n174.\tTerrorism in its full scope is part of the moral erosion of mankind, characterized by unlimited competition, by the unleashing of egoisms, and it is a threat to the permanent values of the modern world. Are these signs of the imminent downfall of our civilization, as seen by Paul Valery when he judiciously recalled that civilizations, too, are mortal?\n175.\tOur age, which has seen the curious coexistence of science and illiteracy, is growing exhausted, as once did ancient Rome, on the one hand foundering in wealth and luxury, and on the other in poverty and physical and moral destitution. Recently a voice of great authority noted that we are now entering upon a phase similar to that which preceded the fall of Rome.\n176.\tFollowing the Munich tragedy, President Duvalier condemned terrorism in general and acts of barbarism which arouse the reprobation of the international conscience and imperil the peace, comprehension, solidarity and fraternity which should characterize relations between peoples and races.\n177.\tThe Republic of Haiti considers that collective measures, supported by all Governments no matter what their ideology, could put an end to these kidnappings, seizures, assassinations and aerial hijackings, which are infringing the rights of individuals and nations. We therefore offer our undeserved support to the resolutions to that end which will be submitted at this twenty-seventh session.\n178.\tThe panorama which we have just sketched would leave little room for hope did we not believe in man's capacity to see obstacles as a challenge to fetch up, from the roots of his humanity, the conscience and energy necessary to transcend particularism and feed the hopes of universal fraternity and solidarity in the reconciliation of man with himself, of man with nature, and of man with his neighbor.\n179.\tIf the specter of under-development and its painful aftermath continues to hunt four fifths of the world's population, intermittent violence punctuates international relations and creates a general atmosphere of insecurity, there are still some glimmers of hope to light the path of mankind. First of all there is the fact that we are gathered together in this hall to discuss questions of common interest. It is true that for 27 years now we have been coming from all over the world to take part in this exchange of views and even though the results rarely meet our expectations, each year we take up the task again as if to signify our determination to keep alive the United Nations, which, when all is said and done, represents the supreme body for the maintenance of peace and security.\n180.\tWe must not overlook the importance of the East-West detente, which seems to be relegating to history what used to be known as the cold war.\n181.\tThe Tlatelolco Treaty, which definitively established the denuclearization of Latin America, represents an encouraging precedent for all peoples that love fertile and constructive peace. Against the same background we should also consider the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, which represent a milestone in the efforts to safeguard the values of our civilization.\n182.\tThe present efforts are not confined to the mere preservation of the status quo. They are also directed towards the improvement of the quality of life. The impassioned debates on ecology and the environment mark a growing awareness of the problems posed by the consumer society and may usher in a new era of civilization in which man will rediscover his sense of proportion and natural equilibrium.\n183.\tIt is no less important to emphasize the formation of large economic groupings as a factor for peace and progress. The European Economic Community has become a power to be reckoned with in the great debate for the survival of mankind. Its existence is changing the balance of force which once made the future of the world dependent on an extreme ideological polarization. It has shaken up the rules of the game, introducing an element of equilibrium which broadens horizons and multiplies possibilities for the peoples of the third world wishing to safeguard their national identity and their cultures and wishing themselves to determine the conditions for the exploitation of their natural riches. Of course the European Common Market has not yet reached its full power, but its weight can decisively influence major international decisions.\n184.\tThe countries of the third world are following the example of Europe. Groupings and sub-groupings have been, or are being, formed in various parts of the world. In Latin America, the concepts of economic integration and of a free exchange area are finding practical expression and giving pan-Americanism a new dimension. In Africa similar associations reflect the determination of the African States to surmount their deferences and consolidate their independence.\n185.\tThe outlines of a new world are taking shape before our eyes. In addition to the great economic groupings formed by States whose territories constitute natural geographic regions, other broader ensembles are aborning. We should like to mention here the association of all the peoples that are bound together by the French language and culture, without distinction as to race or ideology. Quickened by the breath of France, this association is based on the common desire of the member countries to exploit the wealth of their cultural experience in a spirit of solidarity and fraternity.\n186.\tAll these manifestations of goodwill reflect our concern to harness the aspirations and anxieties of youth in order to build a world commensurate with twentieth- century man. But the Republic of Haiti, whose entire history constitutes an illustration of the maxim that nothing great can be achieved without sacrifice, cannot take refuge in exaggerated optimism. It has resolutely taken the road of national effort. In accordance with the Charter of Algiers,  according to which it is for the developing countries themselves to assume responsibility for their development, our revolution of social justice is changing the economic and social structures, mobilizing the capacities, energies and resources and guaranteeing the participation of all in the benefits of the collective effort.\n187.\tIf we have emphasized the steps being undertaken to preserve mankind from decline and catastrophe, mentioning the signs for hope, it is to exhort us all to go on opening new paths and to mount a vigilant guard around the United Nations. In spite of its limitations, its inadequacies, and even its failures, the United Nations represents the highest political conscience of mankind. I also take this opportunity to reaffirm the unshakable dedication of the people and Government of Haiti to the ideals of peace and development inscribed in the Charter.\n188.\tThat is why the delegation of Haiti wishes to convey to this Assembly the fraternal greetings and the fervent hopes of His Excellency Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier, President-for-life of the Republic of Haiti, for the full success of the twenty-seventh session.\n"

        "file_text": "197.  It gives me great pleasure to extend to the President my warm congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. I hope that this session of the General Assembly over which he presides will be able, with more vigor and tenacity, to achieve the noble principles proclaimed by the Charter.\n198.\tI have pleasure also, in my capacity as the first Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar, to address the representatives of the world community for the first time since the independence of my country, which has enabled us to adopt a policy of domestic reform and to establish foreign relations in the hope that Qatar would take its rightful place in the world community in order to pursue constructive social progress, economic advancement and fruitful co-operation with other nations for the mutual benefit and welfare of all mankind.\n199.\tBefore my country joined this Organization last year, it was associated to it by its belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter and by the practical contribution it was making to its field of work. My country follows with great interest the activities of the United Nations in all fields, particularly those fields of work of concern to the specialized agencies related to it.\n200.\tOur belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations was forcefully expressed by H.R.H. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, on the eve of our independence, when he said:\n\\\"The State accepts the obligations contained in the Charter of the United Nations, and believes in the purposes and principles of the Charter, which advocates the right of peoples to self-determination, international co-operation for the welfare of mankind, the prevalence of peace and security all over the world, and the obligation of nations to solve their differences by peaceful means and to establish relations between themselves on the principles of justice and equality according to the principles of international law.\\\"\n201.\tThe State of Qatar joined the United Nations in the hope that the United Nations would concert its efforts in order to fulfill the purposes and principles of its Charter. But a number of this Organization's resolutions have never been implemented. There was an armed aggression against Arab countries, Members of this Organization, launched by Israel in 1967, during which Israel occupied by sheer force Arab lands. Despite the several United Nations resolutions condemning Israel, Israel still refuses to implement those resolutions and refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. Israel also frustrated the mission of Mr. Gunnar Jarring, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General; but in spite of all that, the United Nations did not take any action in fulfillment of the Articles of the Charter to repel the aggression.\n202.\tThat is not all. The hand of Israel reached to the Holy Places for the purpose of destroying and altering holy Jerusalem. Then occurred the burning of the Al Aqsa Mosque, which led the Security Council in its resolution 271 (1969) to condemn Israel strongly for the measures it was adopting to change the status of Jerusalem.\n203.\tWe all know that the United Nations has recognized the established and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and proclaimed that full respect of these rights was essential for the establishment and prevalence of a permanent and just peace in the area. But Israel, which was responsible for the displacement of the Palestinian people from their homes, is still pursuing its expansionist policy and uses all methods to oppress the people of Palestine. The resolutions of the United Nations regarding the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are disregarded and blocked, a matter which, to our regret, creates doubts about the effectiveness of this Organization as an instrument for maintaining peace.\n204.\tWe therefore strongly advocate and insist that the United Nations see to it that its resolutions are implemented according to the Charter; hence it should force Israel to withdraw from aL the Arab territories which it occupied in 1967 and restore all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people so that the United Nations can work with dignity as an effective instrument for the preservation of peace.\n205.\tMy country admires the great tasks which the United Nations is performing in the economic, social, health and educational fields, and we believe that an expansion of work in these fields and the securing of the necessary funds for them would be the best and most constructive means for the creation of a better international community in which all people can live prosperously and in peace and security.\n206.\tThe Charter of the United Nations is a grand Charter. It contains all the principles cherished by man for a free, peaceful and secure life. But that goal cannot be achieved unless the spirit of justice encompasses all nations and unless all nations abide by the principles of the Charter and implement the resolutions based on it. Then and only then can freedom, equality and international peace and security prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am glad to have the opportunity today of extending to you, on behalf of the South African delegation, my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. At the same time, I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Malik of Indonesia, who so successfully guided our deliberations during the twenty- sixth session of the Assembly.\n2.\tMay I also pay my respects to our new Secretary-General and wish him every success in the discharge of his heavy responsibilities?\n3.\tChange is inevitable, and nowhere is this more true than in the field of international relations. We contemplate today a world different from the world that existed at the time of the last session of the General Assembly, for the past year has witnessed changes of more than ordinary significance, including the evolution of what may be termed a new relationship among the major Powers. It is true that the legacy of the Second World War, the polarization of the nations of the world into different power blocs, is still with us today more than a quarter of a century later. But recently, important developments have begun to ease at least some of the tensions of the past.\n4.\tThese developments have followed a series of initiatives on the part of several of the major Powers, leading, it would seem, to a degree of reconciliation and a lessening of animosity between some of them. We find ourselves in a new situation, and axiomatically a new situation brings with it the prospect of new opportunities. There is, in particular, the promise of better understanding and theft- fore of a more peaceful world.\n5.\tWe in South Africa hope that this promise will be realized. We welcome any development which tends to lessen international tension and which leans in the direction of defusing, rather than accentuating, international confrontation-confrontation which in this day and age could lead to catastrophe for the world. We welcome the approach of the major Powers which, after all these years, are moving increasingly, albeit cautiously, from a posture of mutual recrimination towards one of negotiation. We are glad that the negotiations which have already taken place provide support for the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations, large and small.\n6.\tWhat conclusions are to be drawn by an onlooker from these developments? In the first place, it is striking that, although the internal political and social systems of the major Powers are often widely divergent, this has not deterred them from reaching an accommodation with one another on the issues which have hitherto divided them. None has found it necessary to change its own system or to try to impose such an adjustment on others. It has, in fact, been specifically stated in communiques and conference documentation that essential differences in ideology, social systems and even foreign policies should be no bar to the conduct of relations between States, based on such universal principles as respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, non-aggression against States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. It was also recognized that international disputes should be settled without resort to the threat or use of force.\n7.\tIn the second place we should note that, despite the significance of the recent developments to which I have referred, the progress so far made is unfortunately only marginal in comparison with the awesome magnitude and complexity of the problems that still remain. These problems, which vitally affect not only the larger nations but every nation in the world, include such issues as economic development, the preservation of our global environment, famine and over-population, disarmament, and so on. Any advance in these spheres is encouraging and it is indeed gratifying to acknowledge in passing that a measure of progress has this year been recorded in some of them. It is regrettable, however, that even on such cardinal matters as the environment and economic development, political considerations, for reasons frequently not even remotely relevant to the central issue, are allowed to intrude into the proceedings.\nA/PV.2046\n8.\tHow are the smaller nations affected by the new fluidity in international relations? It is clear that the developments in the past year or two involving the major Powers have acted as a catalyst for the reassessment of many existing political situations. No country can wisely disregard them altogether. It seems to me, furthermore, that the smaller Powers now have an incentive to show that \nthey, too, can relax tension among themselves. The lesson is that consultation and negotiation are more rewarding for all the parties concerned than confrontation leading to possible conflict, destruction and suffering; the lesson is that differences in internal social systems are no deterrent to accommodation between the parties; the lesson, furthermore, is that an essential prerequisite to a climate of mutual trust and confidence, leading to the settlement of differences, is acceptance and implementation of the principles of non-aggression, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and peaceful coexistence. It is my hope that the smaller States will heed this lesson, strive for cooperation and thus lay the basis for the progress and advancement of their peoples.\n9.\tIn the face of the great problems with which the world as a whole is confronted, and with particular reference to me immense task of development which faces the smaller developing countries, none of us can afford the luxury of international bickering and dispute, which distract our attention from the fundamental problems and detract from our ability to solve them.\n10.\tLet us in this regard briefly consider the record of the year which has just gone by. We find that progress has in fact been erratic. In some areas improvement has been registered; in others, however, an atmosphere of armed hostility survives in the aftermath of a regional war; elsewhere we have witnessed military coups d'etat, assassination attempts, massive loss of life in communal conflicts, hijacking and terrorism in its different manifestations. Only some of these activities have received the attention of this Organization. This is the darker side of the picture, but I mention it because these are activities which gravely undermine international order and progress, and history will harshly judge the international community and this Organization if they continue unchecked. In the economic and social fields progress has also been uneven and the world has had to live through a further period of financial crisis and instability. It is clear that progress will not come easily.\n11.\tAgainst this background of shifting international attitudes and uneven accomplishment, may I sketch some of the principles governing South Africa's approach to international intercourse. As a starting-point, let me reiterate that we fully subscribe to the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. We shall continue to apply this principle in the conduct of our relations with our neighbors in southern Africa, where the principle has most relevance for us. We have given solemn undertakings in this regard. Our aim is to exist peacefully with each of them to out mutual advantage. We have no aggressive intentions or expansionist ambitions.\n12.\tWe believe also in the peaceful settlement of disputes, which is the fundamental message of the Charter, and we reject the use of violence and force as a means to an end. Instead we favor dialog and negotiation, contact and communication. We can point in this regard to our contacts with the Secretary-General on the future of South West Africa. We remain ready to enter into dialog with anyone who reciprocates our genuine interest therein. Let me make it clear once again today that we are prepared to discuss even South Africa's internal policies in the course of such a dialog. My country practices and lives dialog and sees in it a positive approach to world problems and an effective way of promoting peaceful coexistence and world harmony.\n13.\tAccordingly we have on several occasions shown our readiness to seek solutions to current problems within this framework. I am convinced that the development of dialog between South Africa and African nations can lead only to improved relations to the benefit of all. There is already evidence that this is so. I may mention in this regard, for example, the historic state visit of the President- for-life of Malawi to South Africa during 1971, which was followed by an equally successful return visit by the South African State President earlier this year. We believe that reciprocal visits of this nature, conducted at all levels, are important from the point of view of breaking down prejudices and increasing understanding.\n14.\tThen there is the question of internal dialog. It has been asserted in some quarters that South Africa should conduct a dialog with its own people before attempting to engage in a dialog with independent States, particularly those of Africa. This assertion appears to be based, as in the case of so many attitudes towards South Africa, on a fundamental misconception of the situation. There is, in fact, a continuing dialog with the various peoples in South Africa, which has been and is being conducted at all levels, from the lowest to the highest. The self-governing nations emerging in South Africa are producing leaders and representatives who are empowered by their own people to conduct a dialog at the highest level with the South African Government and this they have been doing. Ministers and officials of my Government are in constant touch with ministers and their officials in the homelands, all of which enjoy some form of self-government. Last year the South African Prime Minister himself conferred with leaders of all the different peoples of the Republic, some of which, namely the Xhosas and the Zulus, total as many as 4 million each, and these meetings have continued this year. Moreover, these leaders travel overseas extensively and exchange views and ideas with a wide cross-section of world opinion. What is all this, if it is not dialogue in the truest sense of the word?\n15.\tIt is a strange phenomenon that dialogue in any form should be discouraged in this Organization. The Organization, whose raison d'etre is the maintenance of peace in the world, is the largest and most universal forum of the community of nations for the exchange of points of view. Implicit in the concept of the United Nations is that disputes are better settled by words than by force. It is therefore inexplicable and unforgiveable that the membership should actively or even obliquely support in any way programmes of force, violence and terror, while at the same time disavowing dialogue. We hope that all Members will adopt a positive approach to dialogue and that dialogue itself will not become a source of discord among the nations of the world. It would be tragic if it were to be used by some for divisive purposes to split us into opposing groups or blocs.\n16.\tThe repudiation of dialogue leads to reliance upon uglier means of settling differences, none more ugly and abhorrent than terrorism. Recent incidents of terrorism have horrified the world. But terrorism is not new. It has existed for years. During the past decade or more, indiscriminate terrorism has spread to virtually every corner of the globe, bringing in its wake suffering, destruction and death. The terrorist outrages committed at Munich and elsewhere have been widely condemned, here and elsewhere. This is very proper, but it is not enough. Terrorism is a universal evil which must be stamped out everywhere. There can be no differentiation between types of terrorism. In all its forms it is a disease which respects no frontier. None that ignores it abroad is immune to it at home.\n17.\tThis Organization in particular must be consistent. It cannot shirk its duty and discard its Charter in regard to terrorism. We must speak with one voice on this scourge, without equivocation, because terrorism, no matter where it may erupt or what its current guise, cannot shed its essential characteristics: it is beyond the pale of order, of law, of decency, of society and of humanity. We cannot for selfish or regional reasons move to stamp it out in one form or in one region, while encouraging it in another. It is obvious that this merely guarantees its survival and its spread. And yet, the records of this Assembly abound in expressions serving as encouragement to those committed to violence as a means of achieving their political objectives. Furthermore, at the very time of the Munich outrage, plans were openly being laid for stepping up terrorism in Africa. Terrorism will survive so long as this and other Organizations continue not only to condone the use of force and violence as a means to an end but, in certain circumstances, to support and even to subsidize it.\n18.\tWe deplore this attitude. South Africa cannot and will not compromise on the issue of terrorism. We have not hesitated to take drastic action against it in the past, and we shall fight it with all means at our disposal in the future. I much regret, I might add, that even while the Secretary-General and the South African Government are engaged in discussions on the future of South West Africa, with progress already registered, some individuals and organizations, and even some Governments represented here, should still openly advocate the use of force and violence in that Territory.\n19.\tSo far as the contacts between the Secretary-General and my Government are concerned, this is obviously not the opportune moment for me to speak on them at any length. There is no denying that the gap to be bridged is wide and deep, and it cannot be expected that a solution will be found overnight. Time, perseverance and patience will clearly be required. Nevertheless, we sincerely hope that goodwill, mutual trust and understanding will prevail on all sides and that in this atmosphere progress will be possible. I want again to reaffirm that, so far as South West Africa is concerned, the South African Government is firmly committed to the principle of self-determination and independence with all that this implies, and we shall continue to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in the search for a solution.\n20.\tIn the meantime, South Africa is continuing to assist in the development of the Territory and the advancement of its peoples in all spheres so that they may achieve the declared goal of self-determination and independence as rapidly as possible. During the last two generations we have made a considerable contribution to the Territory's development. I may also mention that, by virtue of South African legislation, all revenue collected in South West Africa, including taxation on foreign investments, is applied there exclusively for the benefit of all the inhabitants. In addition, South Africa itself annually contributes directly and indirectly a substantial amount to the Territory's development. In 1972 this additional contribution by the south African Government, on current account alone, is estimated at $80 million, an amount which very nearly equals South West Africa's own estimated revenue receipts. We shall be more than prepared to continue to assist the peoples of the Territory after independence, if that is what they desire; and we are in a good position to do so, because of our close association with South West Africa over many years, our geographic proximity and our links in numerous fields; but it will be clear that our assistance then cannot be on the same scale as it is today. Even now the growing needs of the indigenous peoples can hardly be met from local and South African resources combined.\n21.\tAfter independence, therefore, as in the case of most newly independent States, they will inevitably continue to look beyond their borders for assistance.\n22.\tIn all the circumstances, we simply cannot understand the motives of those who discourage new foreign investment or call for the cessation of existing foreign investment in South West Africa. It cannot be in the interest of the peoples of the Territory to deprive them of the contribution to their welfare which overseas investors make in the context of their business operations there, for it is the inhabitants themselves who gain from such investments. And it must surely be clear that, the closer we move in the direction of self-determination and independence, the more important foreign investment becomes in developing the essential economic launching-pad which new States need in order to get off to a sound start. An attempt to retard the economic growth of the Territory simply means a prolongation of its economic dependence upon others. I would ask those discouraging, or advocating a withdrawal of, investments in South West Africa at least to take account of the wishes of the inhabitants of the Territory, and to cease arrogating to themselves exclusively the privilege of deciding what is in their best interests.\n23.\tFrom what I have said today, it should be clear that South Africa has adopted an approach to its problems and its relations with other countries which is not out of tune with the current trend of negotiation and detente now influencing international relations. This applies both to the conduct of South Africa's internal affairs and to the wider international sphere.\n24.\tI have in mind, in this regard, relations, with our neighbors as well as with the United Nations. We subscribe to this policy because we are convinced that, provided our efforts are not undermined by external influences, it will promote peace in our part of the world.\n25.\tIt should not be necessary to commend a similar approach to Members of this Organization, since that approach is implicit in the Charter. But a return to the Charter in this respect might lead the Organization to higher levels of achievement in the pursuit of its principal objective: international peace "

        "file_text": "During the past few years the world has made remarkable advances toward the Charter goal of practicing tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbors.\n45.\tIn 1972 alone, the United States and the Soviet Union have undertaken with each other to do their utmost to avoid military confrontations, to respect the sovereign equality of all countries and to promote conditions in which no country would be subject to outside interference in its internal affairs. The Soviet Union and the United States have also placed precise limitations on our defensive and, at least for the next five years, on our offensive strategic missile systems. The United States and the People's Republic of China have undertaken to broaden the understanding between our peoples, to improve relations between us in the conviction that this would be in the interests of all States, and to oppose any efforts to establish hegemony in Asia or toward division of the world into spheres of influence. The United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed on specific provisions to ensure unimpeded movement to and from Berlin by road, rail and waterways. The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have opened negotiations on a treaty to normalize their relations. And North and South Korea have intensified their talks on the plight of divided families and have agreed to establish a joint committee to examine problems of unification.\n46.\tThere have been many other accomplishments in pursuance of the Charter's objectives in 1972. I mention these merely to illustrate how old patterns of hostility are being eroded. If continued, this process will in time find positive reflection within the United Nations itself.\n47.\tWe are encouraged, too, by calls in both Eastern and Western capitals for a more secure and open Europe. A step toward realizing this goal would be the creation of a more stable military balance in central Europe through negotiation of mutual and balanced force reductions. We are currently in consultation with our allies, and we believe exploratory talks on this subject could begin within the next several months. We trust they will be productive.\n48.\tIt is equally important to move toward more normal relationships in Europe relationships which have not existed since the end of the Second World War. Toward this objective, a conference on security and co-operation in Europe, if it is carefully and constructively prepared, could play a crucial role. A conference whose over-all effect was to put a stamp of approval upon the rigid divisions of Europe would only prolong the problems of today into yet another generation. On the other hand, a conference which promoted a more normal relationship among all of Europe's States and peoples would reinforce the trend toward better \nrelations on other levels. That is why we believe that the conference must take practical steps to promote the freer movement of people, ideas and goods across the breadth of the continent.\n49.\tWe are also now studying alternative approaches for the forthcoming Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The United States will pursue the following general aims. First, our endeavor will be to negotiate on offensive weapons. In so doing we shall seek to expand the scope of strategic offensive weapons included in the limitations and to establish an equitable balance in the major delivery systems. Second, we shall wish to examine carefully qualitative limitations which could enhance stability. Third, we will aim to reduce levels of strategic arms. As President Nixon said to this General Assembly in 1969, our objective is \\\".. . not only to limit the build-up of strategic arms, but to reverse it.\\\"\n50.\tOf course we also attach importance to the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which has now turned its attention to preventing the accumulation of chemical weapons for use in warfare. Work in that Committee has come a long way towards resolving some of the important and complex issues related to possible significant restraints in this area. The United States is intensifying its study of all proposals and we look forward to responding to them at an early date.\n51.\tIt is clear from what I have said that the United States believes that a practical step-by-step approach is the best way to achieve genuine progress m disarmament.\n52.\tLet me take note of other areas in the world in which progress needs to be accelerated.\n53.\tIn Africa, this Assembly must continue to champion the efforts of all peoples of all races to secure human dignity, self-determination and social justice. The United States will continue to lend its full support to all practical efforts to those ends.\n54.\tIn Latin America, while growth rates in recent years have far exceeded Alliance for Progress targets, economic development is still a primary concern and a primary need. The United States Government remains committed to a substantial program of economic assistance, particularly through regional organizations. And, in recognition of the importance of trade to development, we are actively supporting the participation of Latin American and other developing countries in the coming negotiations on a new international monetary system.\n55.\tIn Viet-Nam the United States has reduced its armed forces from about 550,000 to 35,000. President Nixon has proposed a cease-fire in all of IndoChina under international supervision, an exchange of prisoners of war, and a total withdrawal of United States forces. Under this proposal the political future of Viet-Nam could be negotiated by the VietNamese themselves. President Nixon has also pledged a major effort to assist both VietNamese States in post-war reconstruction. In such circumstances it is hard to understand why the other side persists in believing that the war should be continued.  \n \n56.\tAnd in the Middle East, the momentum towards a peace settlement must be regained. We should take note of two positive elements. First, the cease-fire is now in its twenty-sixth month. Second, the climate for a settlement seemed to improve very much as 1972 progressed. We must, however, recognize that the Munich killings have set off deplorable patterns of action and reaction and I emphasize that the United States believes that both action and reaction are deplorable-and that these patterns have seriously clouded the prospects for early progress. Nevertheless, neither side has permanently closed the door to future diplomatic efforts. We believe that the forces favoring a peaceful settlement still have the upper hand. Our task in this Assembly, our task individually as representatives of nations, is to do everything possible to see that the forces that favor a peaceful settlement are supported.\n57.\tThe \\\"no war, no peace\\\" situation which prevails now in the Middle East does not and will not serve the interest of anyone in the area. Certainly a stable, just and durable peace agreement based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967) continues to be the objective of the United States. But this, we believe, cannot be achieved without the beginning of a genuine negotiating process between the parties concerned. No settlement imposed from the outside can long endure. Negotiation is not capitulation. Negotiating activity among long-standing antagonists across the world is occurring at present. Why should the Middle East be an exception? When North Korea can talk to South Korea, when East Germans can talk to West Germans, when Indians and Pakistanis can meet in the immediate aftermath of war and prior to the withdrawal of troops, then surely the Middle East should be no exception to the general rule that differences should be reconciled through an active dialog between the parties concerned.\n58.\tLet me hasten to add that we do not hold that the process need necessarily begin through direct negotiations. We understand that other diplomatic avenues exist. Ambassador Jarring remains available to help the parties negotiate the terms of a peace settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n59.\tAnother-and in our view the most promising-first step would be proximity talks leading to an interim Suez Canal agreement. What would such an agreement do? It would separate the combatants, restore to Egypt operation of and authority over the Suez Canal, involve some Israeli withdrawal, preserve the cease-fire, and provide momentum for further efforts towards an over-all settlement.\n60.\tIt is encouraging that both sides agree that such an interim agreement would be not an end in itself but rather the first step towards an over-all peace settlement. Such a practical test of peace on the ground would be in the interests of both sides, and the United States remains prepared to assist in achieving it, if that would be helpful to the parties. Moreover, an over-all settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must meet the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Governments on both sides as well as of the Palestinian people.\n61.\tIn considering some of the great political developments of the past few years, one cannot help but observe as the Brazilian Foreign Minister has just done- that the United Nations has not been directly involved. This fact has often been cited in attacks against it.\n62.\tWe are all aware, of course, that the Charter does not intend the United Nations to be the center of all diplomacy. Still, as the Secretary-General puts it temperately in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, . . in the political sphere the Organization's place is . . . uncertain\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 1]. With that thought most of us would agree.\n63.\tAs we look to the future, it is well to keep in mind that it is not so much in institutional reforms-and we are certainly not opposed to such reforms-as in national wills that the solutions to the problems must be sought. The future of this body, the future of the United Nations, depends on national wills, on the ability of nations to work together, accommodating themselves to each other's problems, if you will. Yet to the extent that better work methods and more realistic institutional arrangements will help, we also must bring them about.\n64.\tFor example, we believe that for the Security Council to maintain its influence and authority, ways must be found to ensure the representation of States, other than the present permanent members and I am speaking about States whose resources and influence are of major importance in world affairs. The absence of Japan, for example, is notable in a body designed to engage the responsibilities of the world's principal Powers.\n65.\tWe believe in greater recourse to fact-finding commissions, to good offices and to quiet preventive diplomacy.\n66.\tWe believe that the increase in bloc voting, often without independent regard for the merits of the issue, is leading increasingly to unrealistic results.\n67.\tThe discussion of the United Nations weaknesses in dealing with political problems has reached its peak just at a time when its contribution to economic development and scientific and technological co-operation is making great strides.\n68.\tLong before economic development became a major matter of international concern, the United Nations initiated efforts to reduce the economic gap between developed and developing countries. From the start the United States has supported that effort. It is an encouraging fact that during each of the last three years the per capita growth in production has finally achieved a higher rate in the less developed than in the developed world. Still, as the recent World Bank report showed, there are serious problems of income distribution, high rates of infant mortality, low rates of literacy, serious malnutrition and widespread ill health.  The United States intends to continue to devote serious efforts to solving such problems through the improved United Nations Development Program, and through other channels of economic assistance. \n69.\tUnited Nations activities related to science and technology are also having an impact.\n70.\tThe landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has proposed a world monitoring of levels of pollution in water, air, earth and living beings, measuring levels of specific chemicals, such as hydrocarbons which poison the air of the world's cities. To launch this and other important programs without delay, we urge this Assembly to establish the secretariat and the proposed $100 million fund for the environment.\n71.\tThe United Nations can also make a substantial contribution in the fight against drug traffic, particularly heroin traffic. A revised Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs will give the International Narcotics Control Board authority to reduce poppy cultivation and opium production in countries shown to be sources of that traffic. The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control is helping States to improve their drug administrations, to train police and customs officials, to develop other means of livelihood for opium farmers, and to prevent and treat drug addiction. As President Nixon said last week, \u201cEvery Government which wants to move against narcotics should know that it can count on our country for our wholehearted support and assistance in doing so'.\n72.\tJust last week the Secretary-General announced that 1974 will be the World Population Year and the time, of a major United Nations population conference. It is our hope that the conference will lead to the setting of concrete goals of reduced population growth.\n73.\tThe General Assembly at this session will review the progress of its sea-bed Committee? in preparing for a conference on the law of the sea [item 36]. It is important for us to use this opportunity to help make the oceans an example of international co-operation rather than an area of future conflict.\n74.\tSuch activities as pollution, narcotics, the sea-bed and population control-most of them connected with new applications of science and technology will increase in importance in the future. We believe that they must acquire a greater focus and priority in the United Nations.\n75.\tI have spoken today about some of the United Nations weaknesses as well as some of its strengths because I believe we must look at this Organization realistically so that we may contribute to its future prospects. In that spirit, the United States will continue to support the United Nations. We remain committed to making it stronger and more effective.\n76.\tDuring this session the United Nations will have an opportunity and an obligation to take action of vital importance to the international community. The United Nations must deal effectively with criminal acts of international terrorism which have so tragically touched the lives of people everywhere, without warning, without discrimination, without regard for the sanctity of human life. \n77.\tTwenty-four years ago the United Nations, in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirmed that every human being has the right to 'life, liberty, and the security of person'. Yet what is happening in the world today to that security?\n78.\tIn Sweden, 90 people boarding an international flight are held hostage and held for ransom by Croatian terrorists.\n79.\tIn London an Israeli diplomat is killed by a bomb sent through the mail. In New York colleagues in the United Nations narrowly avert a similar fate.\n80.\tIn Cyprus 95 persons of many nationalities narrowly escape death on a Venezuelan plane when a bomb is discovered just in time.\n81.\tIn New York shots are fired into the apartment of a member of the Soviet mission where children are playing.\n82.\tIn Munich 11 Olympic athletes are kidnapped and murdered in a day of horror witnessed throughout the world.\n83.\tIn Czechoslovakia a Czechoslovak pilot is killed and his plane hijacked and diverted to West Germany.\n84.\tIn Israel 26 tourists, 16 of them American citizens, are slaughtered in an insane attack at an international airport.\n85.\tIn this year alone 25 airliners from 13 countries have been successfully hijacked, and 26 other attempts have been frustrated. In this year alone 140 airplane passengers and crew have been killed-140 have been killed-and 97 wounded in acts of terrorism. In five years 27 diplomats from 11 countries have been kidnapped and three assassinated. In New York, Arab and other missions have been threatened with violence.\n86.\tIs there anyone here in this Assembly who has not had the occasion, as he has journeyed by plane from around the globe, to be concerned about his own personal safety? Is there any one of you here who has not wondered what terrorist might strike next, or where he might strike?\n87.\tThe issue is not an issue of war-not war between States, not civil war or revolutionary war. The issue is not the strivings of people to achieve self-determination and independence. Rather, it is whether millions of air travelers can continue to fly in safety each year. It is whether a person who opens his mail can open it without fear of being blown up. It is whether diplomats can safely carry out their duties. It is whether international meetings, like the Olympics, like this General Assembly, can proceed without the ever-present threat of violence. In short, the issue is whether the vulnerable lines of international communications the airways and the mails, diplomatic discourse and international meetings can continue, without occupation, to bring nations and peoples together. All who have a stake in this have a stake in decisive action to suppress these demented acts of terrorism.\n88.\tWe are all aware that, aside from the psychotic and the purely felonious, many criminal acts of terrorism derive from political origins. We all recognize that issues such as self-determination must continue to be addressed seriously by the international community. But political passion, however deeply held, cannot be a justification for criminal violence against innocent persons. Certainly the terrorist acts I have cited are totally unacceptable attacks against the very fabric of international order. They must be universally condemned, whether we consider the cause the terrorists invoke noble or ignoble, legitimate or illegitimate.\n89.\tWe must take effective steps to prevent the hijacking of international civil aircraft.\n90.\tWe must take effective steps to prevent murderous attacks and the kidnapping of diplomats.\n91.\tWe must take effective steps to prevent terrorists from sending bombs through the mails, or murdering innocent civilians. Just a few hours ago, I am pleased to note, the International Criminal Police Organization [INTERPOL], by a vote of 58 to none, condemned such acts and decided to gear up its machinery to help cope with this very difficult problem.\n92.\tThe United States welcomes the initiative the Secretary-General has taken to place this matter on the agenda [A/8791 and Add.l]. Two years ago, before the problem had reached its present dimensions, the General Assembly took the first step, the step that must guide us now. In the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex], which so strongly-keep this in mind reaffirmed the right of self-determination, the General Assembly also unanimously declared that each nation has a duty to refrain from assisting or in any way participating in\n\\\"... terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts...\\\"\n93.\tThe time has come to make that obligation, which this General Assembly solemnly undertook, more specific and more meaningful. In the past two years the international community has taken certain steps in the field of hijacking. Conventions have been concluded prescribing severe penalties for the hijacking and sabotage of aircraft and requiring States to extradite or prosecute hijackers and saboteurs. We urge all States which have not ratified these conventions to do so.\n94.\tWe are now faced with an urgent need to deter and punish international crimes of violence not only in the air but throughout our societies. The United States urges this Assembly to act, and act at once, to meet this challenge.\n95.\tFirst, the draft treaty to prosecute or extradite those who attack or kidnap diplomats or officials of foreign governments or international organizations should be completed and opened for signature at this session of the Assembly. The draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons are already before the Assembly in the report of the International Law Commission [A/8710/Rev.l, chap. II, sect. C]. \n96.\tSecond, a treaty providing for suspension of all air service to countries which fail to punish or extradite hijackers or saboteurs of civil aircraft should be promptly completed and opened for signature. We repeat that such a treaty should provide for the suspension of all air service to countries which fail to prosecute or extradite hijackers or saboteurs of civil aircraft. It is our view that a nation which provides a safe haven for hijackers should be outlawed by the international community. A draft of a treaty to do this has already been considered by a sub-committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization. To achieve early action, the process of deliberation should be accelerated and a diplomatic conference to complete the treaty should be called without delay.\n97.\tThird, a new treaty on the export of international terrorism should be concluded and opened for signature as soon as possible. It should include universal condemnation of, and require the prosecution or extradition of, persons who kill, seriously injure or kidnap innocent civilians in a foreign State for the purpose of harming or forcing concessions from a State or from an international organization. To complete such a treaty, we believe a diplomatic conference should be convened as soon as possible. The United States Government is today circulating the first draft of such a treaty.  We urge all governments to give it their earnest consideration. We refer to this as a first draft, because we are sure that many suggestions for changes will be made. We are perfectly flexible on the form of the treaty, but we think this is a subject that deserves our earnest attention.\n98.\tWe have also embodied these various proposals in a draft resolution which we submitted to the Secretariat this morning for distribution. \n99.\tThese actions would mark a major advance in the struggle against international terrorism. Surely, it is in the collective interest of every nation represented in this hall to arrest the growing assault on international order with which we are all faced. Let this General Assembly be the driving force for the specific and vigorous steps that are required. Let it prove that the United Nations can meet this test. Let it show people everywhere that this Organization, here, now, is capable of the concrete action necessary to bring us closer to a world free of violence-the kind of world which is the great goal of the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government, and on my own behalf, I wish to express to you, Mr. President, our sincere and cordial congratulations on your election. Under your distinguished guidance our task of fulfilling the purposes and principles of the United Nations promises this year to be most fruitful.\n2.\tGuatemala is attending this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly moved as always by a desire to take part in the work of this lofty world Organization and with a faith that has been confirmed in the noble principles which uphold it. We are fully convinced that, despite the great difficulties encountered since its birth, the United Nations has increasingly asserted itself in the maintenance of peace, the preservation of future generations from the scourge of war, and the protection of all mankind in the social, economic and human rights fields.\n3.\tNo one can be unaware that in the first area, notwithstanding the persistence of the Viet-Nam conflict and the delicate situation in the Near East, the United Nations has remained active in its efforts to maintain peace, which is the fundamental requirement for the development of all forms of international co-operation which ensure solidarity among men and nations.\n4.\tWe must not fail to realize that part of this general and constructive activity has been the resolutions on general and complete disarmament, the Treaties relating to the nuclear test-ban and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which inspired the recently concluded agreements among the great Powers. Consideration has also been given to the elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and to the peaceful use of the sea-bed and outer space, and to policies to halt the arms race, the economic and social consequences of which have been delaying the integral development of the largest portions of the world's population. Of great significance for peace too are the efforts and achievements of the United Nations in the liberation of peoples under the colonial yoke. In Korea its efforts, together with those of the Korean people, have done much to reunify that great nation. In the human rights field, we here reaffirm our faith in the work of the United Nations and in the principles of its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and we condemn all policies of racial discrimination which denigrate the human person.\n5.\tGuatemala, therefore, reiterates both its support for the purposes which inspired the establishment of the United Nations as an Organization of the entire international community and its full respect for the legal principles incorporated in the Charter; we also support compliance with all the obligations which that legal instrument imposes on the Members of this Organization. Specifically, we reaffirm the competence of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security, and we believe there is a need to strengthen the Organization so that it may attain this common objective of mankind.\n6.\tAs for the growing effort to develop universal co-operation under United Nations sponsorship in an effort to preserve and improve the human environment, I wish to say that Guatemala participated with great interest in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June of this year, at which my delegation was honored to represent the fraternal Governments of Costa Rica and El Salvador.\n7.\tIn the light of the results of the Stockholm Conference, Guatemala expresses its intention to co-operate internationally in implementing the standards and principles incorporated by world consensus in the historic Declaration of the Conference.  At the same time, the Government of my country intends, at the national level, to take all measures it deems appropriate to improve the quality of the environment and to preserve the ecological balance as part of its programs for economic and social development, the ultimate purpose of which is the continuous improvement of the Guatemalan standard of living.\n8.\tConsistent with its traditional position, my Government will support in this Assembly any action to permit the participation of the developing countries in the machinery and programmes of the United Nations related to the human environment, and will promote all international \nefforts in this field, as long as they equitably respond to the aspirations and needs of the developing countries.\n9.\tMy Government has also endorsed General Assembly resolution 2750 C (XXV), in which the Assembly decided to convene a conference on the law of the sea in 1973, recognizing \\\"the need for early and progressive development of the law of the sea\\\". The peoples of America are fully aware that we depend on natural resources for our subsistence and regionally we have proclaimed the right to protect, preserve and develop those resources and to ensure their use and exploitation, including primarily those of the sea, the legal regime for which in the Americas was consolidated in 1956, by the Principles of Mexico on the Juridical Regime of the Sea, which are recognized:\n\\\"... as the expression of the juridical conscience of the Continent, and as applicable between the American States\\\"; \nand more recently by the following:\n\\\"That the economic and social development of all the peoples and the assurance of equal opportunities for all human beings are essential conditions for peace;\n\\\"That the renewable and non-renewable resources of the sea contribute to improve the standard of living of the developing countries and to stimulate and accelerate their progress;\n\\\"That such resources are not inexhaustible since even the living species may be depleted or extinguished as a consequence of irrational exploitation or pollution;\n\\\"That the law of the sea should harmonize the needs and interests of States and those of the International Community\\\". [A/8721, pp. 70-71.]\nThe American States, meeting last June, laid down in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [ibid., pp. 70-73] the legal standards for the territorial sea, the patrimonial sea, the continental shelf, the international sea-bed, the high seas, pollution of the sea and regional co-operation, which are to prevail as a protection and safeguard of the rights and interests of our peoples.\n10.\tThe present Government of Guatemala is the result of an election held in accordance with the constitutional and legal procedures of our country and in keeping with the purest democratic processes and the free interplay of political parties. The people of Guatemala exercised their right to self-determination and elected the government of their choice. And yet my Government has had to face the problem, now widespread throughout the world, of subversion and terrorism by extremist and clandestine minority groups. My Government, with the resources available to it under its Constitution and laws, has proceeded to bring to the country peace, which is indispensable to continuing the irreversible task of improving the social, cultural and economic life of the nation in order to attain the development level necessary in the world during the times we live in. The constant action of terrorism, which weakens peoples, together with defects in the factors for development, led the President of the Republic, on celebrating our independence, to declare:\n\\\"The sum of many weaknesses produces only inferior countries, and if we have no strength or resolution to improve the quality of our life in our national community, independence will merely be a symbol, but not a reality.\\\"\n11.\tOur Government has viewed with concern the intensification of terrorist activities in various parts of the world characterized by kidnapping and coercion with a continuous threat to the lives and property, of our own citizens and of foreigners; this in some cases has led to the criminal and unspeakable assassination of the victims. This is a breach of the most sacred human right, the right to life, and is particularly reprehensible because of its cruelty and cowardness and because it shows total scorn for the legal institutions which have been created to bring about harmony and the common good of society. We consider that a state of law cannot accept such crimes and extortions by attributing to them apparently political motives when by their commission what is intended is to create a general atmosphere of insecurity and collective fear, and a lack of confidence that public order will officially be ensured, thus provoking a crisis in the rule of law and bringing about political and social chaos.\n12.\tGiven that situation, my Government reiterates its complete support for resolution 4 (I-E/70), which was adopted on 30 June 1970 by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, at its first special session, in which acts of terrorism, and especially the kidnapping of persons and extortion connected with that crime, were condemned as crimes against humanity. That resolution also establishes that those acts constitute grave common crimes and recommends that Member States adopt such measures as they may deem suitable, in the exercise of their sovereignty, to prevent and when appropriate to punish crimes of this kind, and to facilitate the exchange of information that will help in the prevention and punishment of crimes of this kind.\n13.\tMy Government considers that kidnapping and other attempts upon the life, physical integrity or freedom of persons constitute common crimes, whatever the motives for which they are committed and that acts of terrorism, including the kidnapping of persons for purposes of blackmail, do not constitute either political crimes or their related common crimes.\n14.\tMy delegation will support any draft resolution submitted to this General Assembly the purpose of which is to develop international co-operation in order to preserve the community of nations from terrorism which threatens the stability, democracy and the security of our institutions and the well-being of our peoples.\n15.\tOn another subject but in connexion with the internal and regional action of my Government, I wish to declare that in our desire for economic improvement we are continuing to implement the five-year integral development plan, land reform and institutional and fiscal reforms intended to raise the standard of living of the nation. Regionally, Guatemala continues to participate actively in the Central-American Common Market, which, despite the various crises which have arisen in the past years, continues its forward march. The' process of industrialization is continuing, but in order to bring about the economic well-being which we aspire to for the people of Guatemala, we need the co-operation of the international community, and particularly that of the highly industrialized countries.\n16.\tAt the important third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], held at Santiago, Chile, in April and May 1972, we pointed out that there was a lack of understanding for the problems which affect countries such as ours, which are at a relatively low stage of development. We' observed this lack of understanding not only among the industrialized countries but also in some of the more advanced developing countries.\n17.\tExports of farm and agricultural products are and will continue to be very important in earning foreign exchange in Central America. Guatemala is convinced of the need to strengthen the international agreements on commodities, such as coffee or sugar, but we believe that for the least developed countries different criteria should be applied from those that are applied to the other developing countries which have reached a more advanced level of economic progress. In determining quotas, the index of industrial development must be taken into account, as well as dependence on the product in question, the nature and availability of natural resources and, in general, the degree of socio-economic development of the country.\n18.\tOne of the major obstacles we are confronting in the path towards development is the unjust, arbitrary and artificial payment of our labor in the international markets. To be able to move ahead it is necessary that there be established some machinery whereby we shall be able to obtain an equitable price for our commodities.\n19.\tIt is also imperative to proceed to greater liberalization of the tariff barriers of all the industrialized countries so as to permit the growing participation of the goods of the developing countries in their markets.\n20.\tThe establishment of a new international monetary order, in which the developing countries will participate fully, is indispensable for economic development. Small countries should not have to suffer the consequences of economic imbalances for which they are not in the least responsible.\n21.\tWe reiterate our complete support for regional economic integration, being convinced that it is only through it that we can achieve full development. This integration, however, must be carried out taking very much into consideration the socio-economic disparities in various countries. Central America is made up of five least developed countries, a category which has been accepted in the Central American subregion as well as at the Latin American level. Worldwide, the additional criteria should be adopted to identify least developed subregions, which could be considered as a unit, so that special measures could be applied to them to promote their economic development and integration.\n22.\tAs regards peace in the region of Central America, my country has carried out intense diplomatic activity intended to make it easier for two brother countries, which have in the past had tragic moments of armed conflict, to return to cordial relations by a settlement of their differences on the basis of the standards of international law, living together in peace, co-operation and solidarity, with full respect for the sovereignty and independence of States in their quest to carry out their legitimate interests.\n23.\tLastly, I wish to affirm that the Republic of Guatemala has had with the United Kingdom a dispute of more than 100 years over our territory of Belize, which is occupied by that Power. Years ago Guatemala agreed to submit this dispute to the peaceful means for the settlement of disputes established in international law and prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations as mandatory for States Members of the Organization. Good Offices, mediation and direct negotiations have occupied our special attention in seeking a just and equitable solution which will make it possible to restore the territory of Belize to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Guatemala while not ignoring the interests of the population living there. My Government reiterates that it will oppose any change in the legal and political status of Belize without a prior and complete settlement of the problem of the rights of Guatemala over that territory.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the outset I wish to congratulate you on your assumption of the stewardship of this session of the Assembly, a responsibility upon which you have embarked with tact and dynamism. Our congratulations also go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, who is approaching the close of his first full year with us. To you we pledge unfailing co-operation, to him unflinching support.\n74.\tThere have been two recurring themes in the general debate this year, terrorism and detente two seemingly irreconcilable phenomena. In this statement I wish essentially to address myself to those two questions.\n75.\tSince the Second World War, which gave man the impetus to organize along international lines in the hope of controlling dangers to peace and security at various structural levels, the world has witnessed radical changes which have revolutionized concepts of time and space and therefore given new dimensions to the global interdependency of man. What happens in another country, even in a village of peasants, is no longer the isolated concern of those immediately involved but is the concern of all.\n76.\tThe world has also witnessed the awakening of man to Ms birth-rights and the realization by nations that no people is good enough to be another people's master.\n77.\tBut in spite of this awakening and interdependency, violence is still rending the world. This violence in the world only constitutes a small part of a much more pervasive problem of disorder resulting from human indignities and tragedies that now afflict the larger portions of mankind across the globe but which rarely find adequate representation in media that are often motivated by self-seeking ends exclusively. Indeed, only when remote problems leave a sign on our door-steps do we seem to realize that we are not on an isolated island of peace and security, that we are in the midst of a sea of human indignity, suffering and tragedy.\n78.\tThe world is plagued by terror -terror within and terror without the bounds of our countries; terror by individuals as well as terror by groups of individuals and States. Within, it is often a reaction against inequities of birth or inequalities of worth or repulsion against the moral asphyxia of a decaying civilization. Without, it is a revolt against colonial servitude, territorial aggression or national humiliation. In all those cases, terror is motivated neither by an innate disposition to violence nor by a propensity for spite. Instead it is a response to inner torments born out of inequity and frustration. In all those cases nothing is wanton. Wanton terror by individuals or groups of individuals stands condemned. At the national level it is a grievous affliction; at the international level, an unmitigated disaster. No Government that believes in a better world order and the well-being of man can wink at the former or license the latter.\n79.\tIf we are genuinely seeking to deliver mankind from violence in all its forms, we had better address ourselves not only to its consequences but also to its genesis. The failure to realize fully the interdependency of the local, national and regional interests of the world community has generally resulted in the inability of the world Organization to appreciate the root-causes of problems often grounded on the lower and intermediate levels of the world structure.\n80.\tIf we have opposed, therefore, the inclusion of this item [item 92] in the agenda of this Assembly, we have not done so because we are challenging either the initiative of the Secretary-General to deal with a universal adverse phenomenon or the duty of this Organization to handle willful actions that threaten the very fabric of civilized society. What we have wished to guard against is the exploitation of the item and the occasion by those whose convictions are suspect and whose virtue is questionable. The way in which this debate has unfolded has borne us out.\n81.\tIt is revealing that of all those that have spoken on terror the three countries that have chosen to make the subject a major theme of their statements are those that have flouted every single resolution relating to them passed by the competent organs of this Organization, including the supreme peace-making organ, the Security Council, in their efforts to establish peace and order. Need I say that the unholy trinity I am referring to is South Africa, Portugal and Israel?\n82.\tSouth Africa devoted one-quarter of its statement [2046th meeting] to telling the world that terrorism derives from the rejection of dialog and must be condemned whatever the motivations leading to it. Portugal, with one-third of its statement [2048th meeting] on the subject, chose to preach to the world that no desire for justice or reform and no eagerness for liberation could justify the use of force. Israel, with over half of its statement [2045th meeting] on terrorism, tried to talk this Assembly into believing that the most rampant terror in the world today is that which has its roots in Arab hostility to Israel and that in the rest of the world all is milk and honey. It is declarations such as those that explain the position of many of us who advised caution; and it is declarations such as those that make us ask whether words really mean what they say. The term \\\"terrorism\\\" becomes overloaded. In fact it is so overloaded that it has become vacuous. Perhaps it is here that we should start: by defining the meaning of \\\"terrorism\\\", Wisdom, in the words of Socrates, begins with the definition of terms. Oratorical virtuosity, consummate fabrications and insolent demagogy cannot lead us very far.\n83.\tYes, let us deal with terrorism. Let us deal with it as we see it: in the pestilence of colonialism that pollutes our continent; in racialism, that defiles our societies; in the tragedies suffered by the innocent peoples of Asia, where bombardment is incessant and armies, despite all the peace overtures, are still marching on with drum and fife; in the willful attacks from the air and land on the peaceful hamlets and innocent women and children of Lebanon. The speakers who have decided to try to keep this Organization during this session in a spasm of anxiety cannot tell us that individual deaths are tragedies and mass murders are only statistics.\n84.\tIt is colonialism, racialism, territorial aggrandizement and the wanton use of force by States that are the mortal enemies of peace and the conduct of civilized human intercourse among peoples and nations.\n85.\tIn Africa, for example, if the United Nations were to be judged only on its record in questions of decolonization and racial discrimination there would be little reason for gratification over its achievements. It is now exactly 26 years since the Organization became involved with African problems, when India in 1946 raised the question of racial discrimination in South Africa.  Since then the General Assembly and the Security Council have between them passed about 130 resolutions, while the International Court of Justice has delivered not less than half a dozen opinions, all on questions of decolonization and racial discrimination in Africa. Many of those resolutions and opinions have disappeared into the morass of good ideas that \\\"might have been\\\". For all its involvement in those questions, spread over a quarter of a century, the United Nations has not been able to improve the lot of Africans and thereby halt the now accelerating drift towards a major conflict and the escalation to more violence; and the extent of this spiral is any body's guess.\n86.\tIn Rhodesia a rebellious white supremacist clique representing only 4.9 per cent of the population is growing in arrogance and reveling in repression. Its racialism is too deeply implanted to abdicate its place to charity and reason,\n87.\tIn the Portuguese Territories about one half of the still dependent 30 million people of the world live. Portugal has yet to learn that the invariable purpose of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)] was the hastening of independence.\n88.\tAll these are not isolated incidents and the United Nations has not failed to relate them to world peace and order. The Security Council and the General Assembly have since 1961 resolved that apartheid would endanger international peace and security and requested all States to consider such steps, singly or collectively, as were open to them to get South Africa to abandon its policies.\n89.\tThe United Nations has also committed itself, since 1968, to economic sanctions under Articles 42 and 43 of the Charter, having determined that the situation created by the Rhodesian rebellion \\\"constitutes a threat to peace\\\". If Africa resorts to force, as indeed it has, and with the blessing of its heads and elders who decided at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] at Rabat to double their support of the liberation movements, it is doing so only to rid the world of an affliction which is insidiously undermining civilized society and to lance a festering sore that is about to pollute its whole body.\n90.\tIn the Middle East, where territories of three Member States have been under foreign occupation for over five years, where a whole people has for nearly three decades been suffering the indignation of forced refuge, and where ceaseless bombardments are carried out on the innocent, violence also is rampant.\n91.\tThe Foreign Minister of Israel, by the prevarication of established historical facts acknowledged by this Organization and reaffirmed repeatedly by different organs, wanted to relate this violence to what he considers the villain of the play. He asked:\n\\\". .. is it true that there is a distinct people\\\" meaning the Palestinian people-\\\"deprived of self-determination, languishing in poverty, squalor and humiliation, dependent on organized violence as its sole prospect of redemption? \\\" [2045th meeting, para. 109.]\nAnd without taking a breath Mr. Eban replied, unabashedly, to his own question: \\\"Nothing could be further from the truth.\\\" [Ibid.] Here again we have an example of the futility of this debate on terror, where words mean different things to different people.\n92.\tBut we do not have to quibble with words to establish the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, their existence being a reality denied only by Mr. Eban. Mr. Eban is the last person to be unaware of the reason why the General Assembly resolution of November 1947 [resolution 181 (IIj] -to which Israel owes its very existence- was called \\\"the partition resolution\\\". Partition of what? And partition between whom?\n93.\tThis very Assembly resolved, by its resolution 194 (III), that the Palestinians had a right to return to their homes or to be compensated if they chose not to do so. That resolution has recurred at every ensuing session. But neither repatriation nor compensation has taken place, because of Israeli intransigence, which Mr. Eban crowned last week with his negation of the very existence of the Palestinian people. Such an outlook is not conducive enough to a rational consideration of the question at issue.\n94.\tThe crowning irony comes when Israel requests this Organization to engage in a process of law-making banning international terrorism. And the irony is doubled when this request is made in the very statement telling us, in dealing with the Arab-Israeli question, that the United Nations atmosphere-and I quote Mr. Eban is hot \\\"congenial to the craftsmanship of peace\\\" [2045th meeting, para. 68]. That statement is the supreme contribution of Israel to the demise of the United Nations peace-keeping effort in the Middle East.\n95.\tIt was therefore no surprise to anybody that the Israeli statement, in addition to its disdain for all United Nations resolutions relating to the rights of the Palestinian people, was devoid of any reference to Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which the Foreign Minister of Israel himself described last year as the only basis of United Nations jurisprudence in the matter [2015th meeting]. For the rest of us, Mr. Maurice Schumann spoke lucidly and aptly when he said\n\\\"... does any people or country of the Middle East not understand that for its independence to be definitively ensured it must be sheltered from the interplay of outside scheming or rivalries? To this fundamental question there can only be a definitive and sure answer here, not elsewhere\\\" [2041st meeting, para. 80.]\n96.\tIt takes a lot of courage for a plaintiff to come to equity while engaged in unconscionable practice, one basic maxim of the law of equity being; he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. And it takes a lot of arrogance to seek justice while showing contempt for the bench and ridiculing the jury.\n97.\tOn the same theme, the United States has come to this Assembly with a draft resolution[A/C.6/L.851]. The basic defect in that draft resolution is that it ends where it should have begun. The main point should be to urge Member States to address themselves to the sources of tension. As long as there is subjugation and inequity people will always resort to violence to reach goals that are unreachable otherwise.\n98.\tRevolutions have never been concomitant with the sanctity of human life. This mode of social behavior is neither African nor Asian. It was the United States itself that won its independence through violence, years before Robespierre delivered to the world his dictum that in revolution \\\"terror is justice, prompt, secure and inflexible\\\" and that revolution should \\\"conduct people by reason and enemies of the people by terror\\\". And unless flagrant injustices are removed, unless gross inequities are eradicated, unless bitterness is basically extirpated from the hearts of men, the concept of people and enemies of the people will remain to be determined by subjective measuring rods depending on whom and what you relate to. And unless a better and more civilized system of world order is established, in which states breaking the law of nations are brought to account, incidents of wanton terror can neither be isolated nor adequately controlled.\n99.\tA world organization that does not address itself to those objective realities of multiple yet interdependent and interactive dimensions is likely to be fragmented and preoccupied with the visible manifestations of problems on the international level, while leaving their root-causes embedded in the deceptively remote and even isolated national or regional corners of foreign lands. Such an organization will be not only ineffective, but indeed shaken by the undercurrents of frustrations and discontent in those remote corners.\n100.\tthe phenomena of violence as a mode of expressing a grievance or rebelling against an injustice, and that of detente as an outcome of new alignments among States, are not necessarily paradoxical. The dynamics of human endeavor are now revealing new trends of realignment in search of alternative methods of tackling problems. We are witnessing a narrowing gulf between the big Powers in their attempt to solve their problems and promote their mutual national or regional interests, thus averting violence on their soil while continuing it, by proxy, on foreign soil. In other words, violence is being exported to us.\n101.\tDetente and the composition of differences are welcome as long as they do not reflect a preoccupation with problems of immediate national interest, to the exclusion of international problems, or degenerate into a conspiracy of silence. The absence of a single reference to Africa in the Moscow Declaration that mapped out all the problem areas of the world is an example of the former. The irrational position of some western Powers on the issue of Rhodesia in the Security Council is an example of the latter.\n102.\tOn the other hand, new alignments among the small Powers are taking place; old ones are being reinforced. The Rabat meeting of the African Heads of State and Government and the Georgetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, and their outcome, are reflections of this trend. In so far as those meetings are focusing on regional or selected international problems, where the minds are at one, the trend is positive and promising. But in so far as the trend is founded on the failure of the international Organization to solve problems, it is disconcerting.\t\n103.\tThe new alignments and international syndicalism are duly leading to what the Foreign Minister of Brazil has aptly described, in his open statement here as the \\\"diplomatic marginalization of the United Nations\\\" [2038th meeting, para. 33]. Some of us might be deluded into thinking that our salvation is in clubbism and interdependency of interests.\n104.\tBut interdependency of interests implies more than building policies on competitive interaction and interdependence. It requires positive co-operation towards the achievement of the common goal of human dignity in all aspects of life. It requires the global sharing of power, of material wealth, of spiritual well-being and of scientific and technological advantages. And all this requires a change in the fundamental chemistry of international relations.\n105.\tBut in all this where does the United Nations come in? The Georgetown Conference, whose final Act is now in the hands of the Secretary-General, precisely addressed itself to this question. We have all reaffirmed our faith in the Charter of the United Nations, but the Charter is not a fetish. And we have all pledged our support to the Organization, but the Organization will have to change with time. We have all called for the democratization as well as the increased universalization of the United Nations. China is now in our midst and we are the richer by its presence.\n106.\tInstitutions, like men, grow and become obsolescent. Change is imperative if there is to be a new international order based on justice and fair play; it is only the dead who do not change. To achieve this goal, some modification of the Charter and review of the role of various organs are indispensable.\n107.\tThe process is not unknown to the United Nations. Amendments have been introduced to the Charter. Less dramatic, but equally important, is the evolution of the Charter provisions through the various liberal and creative interpretations given to them. The Charter, like all living constitutions, was meant to be adaptive and self-regulating.\n108.\tSuch an endeavor must be undertaken with both imagination and realism. And realism might lead us to accept, but not become resigned to, certain facts of life. Article 2, paragraph 7 and Article 27 of the Charter, lead together, teach us that there is a two-tier concept of equality. What is to be challenged, therefore, is not the weighted power of some States, inherent in the Charter, as much as the wanton exercise of such power. Power is to be disciplined and its exercise civilized, for, when power is unguided by enlightened principle and high purpose, it can only spell disaster in the end.\n109.\tI have alluded to regional realignments and endeavors which are motivated by the desire of nations and regional organizations to tackle their immediate problems, thus enabling them to come to grips with their own urgent needs. Such alignments may frustrate international cooperation in the tackling of political, economic, social and cultural problems.\n110.\tFortunately this is not invariably the case. We in the Sudan do not boast of any achievements in this field but we have an experience which, though local, is a microcosm of many problems now faced in many parts of the world. The co-operation we have received from various friendly Governments, the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as from voluntary organizations, also testifies to the significance of our example as a microcosm of world problems and the potentialities of co-operation in their solution at all levels. \n111.\tThe case in point is our solution to a national problem which has afflicted our country with civil strife 17 years old-which cost us many lives, frustrated our development and fostered resentment and bitterness instead of solidarity and patriotism among brothers and sisters. The so-called Arab North and African South of our country are one people with a lot more in common than the world has heard, but the legacy of colonial isolationist and divisive policies left deep gulf that erupted into hostilities which the successive Governments tried-some genuinely and some half-heartedly-to end, without avail.\n112.\tOur Government realized that the common good of the nation was interdependent with the interests of all its citizens as reflected in their sharing in political power and in the advantages of the economic, social and cultural development of their region. By formulating and implementing a system of regional autonomy, the Government met the political aspirations of the people of the South and has now embarked on an extensive program of immediate relief, resettlement, and rehabilitation of refugees and returnees.\n113.\tThe refugee example is noteworthy because it is unprecedented. For over half a century, since Fridtjof Nansen embarked on the first international refugee program, problems of refugees were solved through either their assimilation in host countries or their return to their homes following military victory. This is the first time in the history of international refugee efforts when refugees, hundreds of thousands of them, are returning to their homes both peaceably and voluntarily, out of their own accord and volition.\n114.\tThe international dimension of the Sudanese experience is evident not only in our accommodation of multiplicity and diversity within unity and community of interest, but also in the co-operation and assistance we have received from the outside world-co-operation and assistance from sister countries, joined to us by bonds of brotherhood, and a world family that saw in our experience a fresh breath of sanity.\n115.\tAnd now, with peace restored, we cannot fail to address ourselves to the other phase of peace-making: social and economic development. Peace and security cannot be fragmented into political, economic, social or cultural components in the vain hope of solving the one without tackling the other. Development is a precondition for stability and expansion and a fundamental prerequisite for international peace and security. As such, the development of the proletarian nations of the world is an international responsibility as well as a national one. The very philosophy underlying the provisions of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] stems from the awareness that the international community has a global responsibility for the solution of social and economic problems.\n116.\tOur economic and social development is keeping pace neither with our own needs nor with the growth of world trade and development. The results are wide-spread poverty, endemic malnutrition and inadequate education.\n117.\tThe present international economic order may not be capable of accommodating the needs and expectations of the developing world, whether because of the wasteful distortion of priorities, the widening gap between the national interests of the affluent and those of the have-nots, or the absence of generally accepted norms. To those questions and others we shall devote our efforts in the appropriate Committee of this Assembly.\n118.\tFor many of us this year is the year of the environment. It is the year of man's unity with nature. However, there is an irony in this situation which did not escape the attention of my learned friend the Foreign Minister of Guyana. He said:\n\\\"... it would be futile to develop a planetary strategy based on the unity of man with other life forms while ignoring those factors of inequality that frustrate and destroy the unity of mankind, and those realities of tension and conflict that impair the quality and threaten the existence of human life itself...\\\" [2038th meeting, para. 110.]\n119.\tThe irony is supreme. But, despite all the alarms on violence and terror as well as all the frustrations and desperations of the afflicted, we cannot but continue our pilgrim's progress. The United Nations will have no choice but to devote all its efforts to those human tragedies that are still awaiting their catharsis.\n120.\tTo that end the Sudan pledges its support to the Organization, which remains, despite all its failings, the abiding corner-stone of world peace and stability as well as of the well-being of man.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, since I am speaking from this rostrum for the first time as the head of my country's delegation, permit me first of all to convey to you my warm and sincere congratulations and the congratulations of the entire Cameroon delegation on your brilliant election to the Presidency of this Assembly. This choice is a just tribute to your distinguished statesmanlike qualities and to your long and rich experience of international problems. It testifies to the high esteem in which your country is held by the world community. We are convinced that under your enlightened guidance and with the continuing co-operation of all those around you, and particularly the members of the General Committee, whom we associate in this act of tribute, our work will be as successful as we hope.\n63.\tI should also like to associate myself with previous speakers in conveying our gratitude and thanks to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, for the skill and competence with which he presided over the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly one year ago.\n64.\tWe should also like to welcome the presence at your side of Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose understanding of the complex problems of our day and valuable experience in the field of multilateral diplomacy permit me to predict that the difficult problems confronting our Organization will be pursued and dealt with competently and effectively.\n65.\tHaving lived for so long in a world where the apprehensions created by the rivalry between the great Powers have generated the fear that at any moment large-scale conflicts might break out, we have just witnessed signs of the relaxation of tensions in international relations. This year in the course of a few months we have just lived through historic moments characterized by contacts which would formerly have been deemed to be impossible between the great Powers. These encounters have been followed with interest and much hope by the international community as a whole, and should be greeted as the dawn of a new era.\n66.\tThe restoration to the People's Republic of China of its lawful rights in the United Nations and the summit meetings between the United States and China, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and the United States, on the other, are evidence-that positive developments are occurring in the relations between the great Powers. For its part, Cameroon, which has a standing interest in international peace and security, is gratified at these felicitous initiatives.\n67.\tSimilarly, we note with a great deal of optimism the ratification of the treaty of 12 August 1970 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union, the treaty of 7 December 1970 between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland, and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971. We believe that these agreements have removed a major obstacle to East-West relations.\n68.\tThese signs of an easing of tensions have created conditions favorable to the search for a solution to the problems of divided countries through direct and independent negotiations between the parties concerned.\n69.\tWe may thus hope that the two Germany and the two Koreas will finally in the not too distant future be in a position to redefine the course of their own destiny.\n70.\tBut along with these positive aspects, we are unfortunately constrained to note that these efforts on the part of the great Powers have not yet led to a general easing of tensions. If peace is indivisible, detente, understanding and co-operation should also be indivisible. However, that does not seem to be the case for the moment.\n71.\tIndeed, in Viet-Nam the war is continuing. We in the Cameroons have never ceased to express our indignation at the long war thus imposed upon that country. The courage of the people of Viet-Nam, their patriotism and their determination to be independent have earned them the admiration and support of the international community.\n72.\tMore than 10 years of fighting involving the great Powers directly or indirectly, and to a lesser degree the rest of the world, thousands of millions of dollars poured out by both sides, about a million soldiers confronting each other in the field, tons of bombs dropped every day: is not all that enough to cause the parties involved in that distressing conflict finally to give serious thought to reaching a negotiated solution which will enable the great people of Viet-Nam to devote themselves to the building of their destiny in independence and peace?\n73.\tThere is no question that all the proposals and programs put forward by the parties directly concerned do contain some positive elements, and we for our part are convinced that with a minimum of mutual trust, and good-will on both sides, it should be possible to make substantial progress at the Paris peace talks.\n74.\tThe situation in the Middle East, the cradle of so many brilliant humanistic civilizations and the treasure house of so much natural wealth, is of equal concern to us. Five years have elapsed since the adoption of the Security Council resolution on the Middle East which gave rise to such great hopes; nevertheless the solution seems as uncertain as ever. Indeed, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the elements which constitute an acceptable basis for carrying forward negotiations between the parties to the dispute with a view to achieving a just and lasting peace in that part of the world.\n75.\tThe United Nations in general and the great Powers in particular should spare no effort to try to restore peace to that part of the world, which is so dear to our hearts.\n76.\tMy delegation is deeply convinced that all these situations of tension and confrontation which have been of concern to us for so many years would be completely eliminated if the policy of natural supremacy and egoism pursued by certain great Powers with their pernicious effects of material and ideological domination, could cease.\n77.\tThat is why we unreservedly support the collect position taken by Ministers for Foreign Affairs of non- aligned countries who, when they met in Georgetown, Guyana, from 8 to 11 August 1972, reaffirmed their devotion to peace and called for the immediate democratization of international relations which would guarantee peace to all States, large and small, and would respect their natural right to participate freely and equally in the common search for solutions to the great problems of the world.\n78.\tCameroon will therefore tirelessly continue to seek world peace and to oppose with increasing determination all forms of aggression as well as the threat or use of force against the freedom, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. My country, with growing determination, will support the struggle of all peoples against colonialism and racial discrimination, which are a denial of the equality and dignity of man.\n79.\tIt would be ungracious of us not to recognize the interest which the United Nations as such has always shown in the problems of the liberation of the African countries which were subjected to colonial oppression and racial discrimination.\n80.\tHow indeed could it be otherwise, since this Organization was born of the will of a group of men determined to put an end for all time to the wrongs engendered by the denial of freedom and equality to all men?\n81.\tThere is no need to recall the long list of resolutions which have been adopted in this area, both by the General Assembly and by the Security Council. But we must stress two acts which have engendered so much hope among the oppressed peoples of Africa. I refer, first of all, to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. Then there is the welcome accorded by the General Assembly to the Manifesto on Southern Africa [resolution 2505 (XXIV)], which the Head of State of Cameroon, in his capacity as the then President of OAU, had the privilege of presenting from this very rostrum. \n82.\tThese two documents contain all the principles whose implementation should be ensured by the international community to remedy a situation which is clearly deteriorating and jeopardizing more and more each day the conditions necessary for the maintenance of peace.\n83.\tSince our last session, the minority and racist regimes which are oppressing millions of men in southern Africa have only further strengthened their hateful system. In South Africa repression has been intensified: priests, professors, journalists and students by the hundreds are crowded into the gaols of Pretoria. Everyone is aware that that country has the largest prison population in the world and also holds the infamous world record for executions. Far from being upset by this, the white minority which holds sway in Pretoria is even extending its Nazi-type system beyond its frontiers, in particular, to the international territory of Namibia, and is strengthening its administration there, despite the repeated appeals of the General Assembly and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice given last year.\n84.\tWe should like to take this occasion to state that we have followed with much interest the efforts of the Secretary-General to discharge the exceedingly difficult mandate entrusted to him by the Security Council. We are bound to add, however, that for us there can be no compromise or concession on the question of the dignity and freedom of peoples. Any steps must be directed towards persuading the racist Government of Pretoria to withdraw from Namibia and replacing the illegal South African occupation by the administration of the international community with a view to preparing the people of Namibia for self-determination and independence.\n85.\tThroughout the previous session we, together with the other African delegations, tried in vain to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the tragicomedy which was being rehearsed in Rhodesia. There was talk then of negotiation with the racist rebel regime in Salisbury. Hence it was with indifference that we witnessed the failure of an undertaking which had been marred by injustice and immorality from the very outset.\n86.\tThe people of Zimbabwe, which some believe have no voice, did in fact make themselves heard unambiguously despite countless acts of intimidation and repression. It is with the representatives of this people that negotiations should be held on a footing of equality in order to reduce the tension prevailing in that area.\n87.\tThe United Kingdom, which has in the past given so many examples of its devotion to freedom and to the rights of peoples, should today have a clear awareness of its responsibilities to the people of Zimbabwe. It is for that Government to take effective measures to enable that people to exercise their inalienable right to sovereignty. Such measures require no special study because they should simply follow the democratic process which has been repeated so many times by the United Nations, namely: first, the restoration of all democratic freedoms and the release of the African militants; secondly, negotiation with the nationalist leaders representing the majority of .he people of Zimbabwe; thirdly, submission of the terms of the agreement to the universal suffrage of the entire adult population of Rhodesia, under the supervision of the United Nations; and fourthly, no independence before the setting up of a government chosen by a democratically elected majority.\n88.\tIf these principles are not respected, we can be sure that the people of Zimbabwe will have no recourse but to pursue with even greater vigor the course of violence taken by frustrated peoples, with the help of the OAU and with the assistance of all freedom-loving peoples.\n89.\tWe are also aware that such a warning has but little chance of being heard by the racist forces of Salisbury, since they draw their inspiration directly from the principles and methods of blind Portuguese colonialism.\n90.\tPortugal, which would be better off devoting its resources to the prosperity of its own people, for more than 10 years now has been stubbornly pursuing a genocidal war although it knows that war is doomed to failure. Furthermore, feeling the ground crumbling under its feet, as was demonstrated by the special mission sent to Guinea (Bissau) from 2 to 8 April 1972 by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, it is making crude attacks on independent African countries, and is also engaged in installing millions of new settlers in Cabora Bassa.\n91.\tWe cannot cease stressing the heavy responsibility for this criminal enterprise that is shared by certain Powers. The sordid commercial ties between these Powers and the oppressors of African peoples in fact constitute the principal factor delaying the victory of the just cause of the freedom-fighters.\n92.\tThat is why Cameroon will not hesitate to intensify the moral and material assistance it is providing to the African liberation movements in order to offset the persistence of colonialism and the cynical reinforcement of racial discrimination.\n93.\tThe efforts of the international community to tackle jointly, through the organs of the United Nations system, certain major economic problems of the day relating to trade and development, the international monetary crisis and the environment, because of their importance and their long-term effects, merit particular attention.\n94.\tIn this area there have been two recent developments: the third session of UNCTAD held at Santiago, Chile, in April and May of this year, and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June.\n95.\tEveryone agrees in recognizing that the third session of UNCTAD did not yield the hoped-for results despite extremely thorough preparation for the work and the huge organization, which was practically perfect; credit for this of course goes above all to the Government of Chile and to the secretariat of UNCTAD.\n96.\tWe must recognize that the paucity of results is owing primarily to the highly negative attitude of the rich countries, which share the primary responsibility for this failure. To the rightful claims of the countries of the third world they adopted an attitude of deplorable selfishness. As a result of the third session of UNCTAD we must record an atmosphere of despair which may poison relations between the third world and the developed countries. True, the richer countries undertook to associate the third world with the forthcoming monetary and trade negotiations; they also agreed to grant special assistance to the 25 developing countries which are identified as the least developed. But the great problem of stabilizing commodity prices was left unsolved, as was that of access of manufactured goods to the markets of the developed countries.\n97.\tIt is true that in this area of international trade relations vast interests are at stake. It is also true that these problems can only be solved over the long term. We must also deplore the lack of cohesiveness in the group of under-developed countries and the lack of any strategy. The fact remains, however, that the essence of the unsolved problems will be taken up at subsequent conferences, for which thorough preparation must be made, taking into account the experience we have gained. For its part, Cameroon will strive to give its utmost support to UNCTAD and to the forthcoming negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] with a view to eliminating tariff barriers. In this regard, we hope for the co-operation of GATT and UNCTAD with a view to reaching solutions likely to satisfy the countries of the third world.\n98.\tWe also place much hope in the negotiations on the International Cocoa Agreement, which is a strategic commodity for some countries, including Cameroon.\n99.\tThe outmoded Bretton Woods monetary system has been so severely criticized that my delegation will not dwell on the process of collapse which has afflicted it since its creation.\n100.\tWith the collapse of this system, new solutions must be found, but with the co-operation of all those who are affected by this monetary system during great crises. The whole world knows that the developing countries have paid a very heavy price as a result of the successive devaluations of the so-called strong currencies, to such a point that the increased participation of these countries in discussions with regard to monetary reform has proved indispensable.\n101.\tDespite their hesitation at the early stages of the preparation for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the African countries finally made a positive contribution to the work of that Conference.\n102.\tThe developing countries have acquired an increased awareness of the problems involved in improving the human environment.\n103.\tIn so far as concerns the United Republic of Cameroon, a knowledge of the natural environment and in particular its effects on the problem's of health, hygiene, and housing is a matter of high priority. Similarly, the safeguarding of the environment for the well-being of mankind requires that remedial action in the management of natural resources must be taken here and now. In saying this, we wish to emphasize our interest in anything which concerns the problems of the environment.\n104.\tWe are happy to note that problems of development have been kept constantly in mind by the representatives of the 114 countries participating in the Stockholm Conference, and we hope that, whatever the forum, those problems will be mentioned at any meeting convened to give further consideration to this burning problem.\n105.\tThe picture which we have just sketched of the international situation in the world today contains many dark spots and the conditions in which we are living, despite a tendency towards a relaxation of tension, are unfortunately still far from encouraging.\n106.\tThe principles of equality among States, respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States are little respected throughout the world.\n107.\tRacial discrimination and colonialism of the most backward kind continue to devastate the African continent, despite the condemnation of world morality.\n108.\tLastly, inequality persists in international economic relations, widening the gap which separates the developed nations from the under-privileged nations.\n109.\tThese various aspects of the world situation today make of inestimable value the search for peace. Whether bilaterally, within OAU, or at the level of the United Nations, my country has constantly worked, within its means, to find a solution to the problems which create tension. We shall continue along this course and we hope that peace, which is mankind's most precious asset, will prevail.\n110.\tThis hope, although not a certainty, rests on certain recent changes in the international climate.\n111.\tThere is no doubt that these positive developments in the international climate will lead to a realignment of relations among States both in the political area and in the economic field.\n112.\tThis is the conviction which guides us and the groups to which my country belong, namely, the group of non-aligned countries at the political level, and the Group of 77 developing countries at the economic level. The Cameroons remains solidly aligned with these groups, which represent the developing countries.\n113.\tIn the world of today peace, security and progress are achieved through the democratization of international relations.\n114.\tThis assertion, which emanates from the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, is worth thinking about. The Foreign Ministers of this group, who met at Georgetown last August, noted the development of an expanding multi-polar system which will replace the present division of the world into two antagonistic blocs. They also noted that, in the course of this evolution, new centers of power are appearing, while at the same time the aspirations of many countries to independence are being reaffirmed. We note that this analysis coincides with that which the Secretary-General of our Organization expressed recently, when he gave what we consider a valid opinion on the very concept of the Security Council itself. At the conclusion of his analysis he stated:\n\\\"The interests, the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot, at this point in history, be ignored in any durable system of world order.\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 2.J\n115.\tThat means that in order to bring about peace, true peace, we have no choice but to appeal to all nations, large and small. As the Head of State of Cameroon has said:\n\\\"What we must do is to build upon the material solidarity of mankind a moral solidarity based on common values build a universal civilization based upon the original and unique contribution of each people. That being said, it is not surprising that the foreign policy of the Cameroons is based upon the dual principle of peace and international co-operation with all nations of the world without discrimination. That concept provides our non-alignment one of its corner-stones, which reflects the will of my country to participate, in freedom, in the building of the common destiny of mankind.\\\"\n"

My first duty, therefore, is to extend to you, Mr. President, my heartiest congratulations and those of my delegation on the unanimity and confidence with which members singled you out from among your eminent colleagues to preside over the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n89.\tOur deep admiration for you as a public figure and a statesman assures us that this session under your guidance will move nations from narrow national conceptions towards planetary conceptions of freedom and justice for all mankind and of sovereign equality for all States. We assure you that your success and the achievements of this session of the General Assembly are anticipated with a maximum of pride and faith.\n90.\tPermit me now, Mr. President, to pay a well-deserved tribute to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, who presided over the work of the twenty-sixth session of this Assembly with political and erudite diplomatic leadership. His voice and effective gavel will long be remembered by all who sat here.\n91.\tAll of us entertain an abiding appreciation of the dedication and sacrifices which U Thant as Secretary- General gave this Organization. He was an international civil servant of great stature and an effective spokesman who concentrated on measures that added significant dimensions of experience to the social welfare and the development aspirations of the developing nations, It is therefore not his fault that so many of the hopes and dreams of our generation remain unfulfilled.\n92.\tBut we are indeed happy that U Thant has been succeeded by a man whose bold initiatives, strength of character, depth of dedication and breadth of understanding give hope for the future of our Organization. Mr. Kurt Waldheim, as Secretary-General, has addressed himself to the problems and the weaknesses of our Organization with a frankness rare in politics. We fervently pray that he will command the co-operation and the support of all Members, in particular the great Powers, to the end that the conditions of the peoples of the world may be improved, peace and security may be realized and maintained, and faith in the United Nations may be restored.\n93.\tThe mission of this Organization is to serve a troubled world in the pursuit of peace and social justice. It is to provide a focal point for efforts to settle the disputes, moderate the attitudes, solve the problems and eliminate the injustices which engender war and promote fear and insecurity. As we enter upon the deliberations of this session of the Assembly, there are encouraging signs that international relations are moving towards conciliation and co-operation, notwithstanding the erstwhile stubborn confrontations and conflicts of the cold war. My delegation is convinced that if this trend is continued mankind can expect the attainment of a world in which real peace can be secured and maintained, social justice can be established, better living standards can be assured and fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person can be reaffirmed.\n94.\tYet the optimism inspired by recent developments is dampened by the increasing complexity of problems that have proven elusive of solution. Some of these problems are perennial agenda items of this Assembly; some the Assembly dare not place on the agenda, but their pertinence and a discussion of them cannot escape us.\n95.\tIf we look back, it can be said that the Organization has a number of accomplishments to its credit in an imperfect world.\n96.\tFirstly, the process of decolonization was accelerated under the auspices of the United Nations. The existence of the United Nations gave anti-colonial forces a formidable institution through which world public opinion was brought to bear. No longer could the colonial Powers rule other peoples with virtually unlimited latitude as they did before the inception of the Organization. Sacred cows and hallowed pastures ceased to exist; no colonial Power could escape the scrutiny and criticism of the world community in respect of its colonial Territory; the level of brashness and condescension with which most colonial peoples were ruled was reduced, and virtually all the colonial Powers became more responsive to the demands of colonial peoples under their rule.\n97.\tSecondly, the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, though far from perfect, have reduced considerably the danger of confrontation between the superPowers. The Middle East conflict, the Congo crisis, the war over Kashmir and the problems in Cyprus readily come to mind as examples of the effectiveness of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.\n98.\tThirdly, the United Nations and its specialized agencies have contributed and continue to contribute to the development efforts of the developing countries in various spheres of endeavor, with a view to making the society of man much more wholesome and functional.\n99.\tFourthly, the United Nations has served as a very useful forum for the discussion of international differences, giving the opposing sides an opportunity to retreat from previously held positions without loss of face.\n100.\tFifthly, and particularly within recent months, a few of the divisive gaps have been bridged and there seems to be a conscientious effort on the part of the big Powers to dismantle some of the ideological, ethnic and other barriers which have divided them. An era of negotiation, dialog and contact has emerged, and the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly has been convened at a time of great significance in the world outlook.\n101.\tThe Soviet Union and the United States have achieved some form of understanding toward trade and cultural agreement; the United States and the People's Republic of China, after 25 years of isolation, arc razing the barriers of division; the membership of the European Economic Community is expanding; a Convention on biological weapons control  has been signed; a Treaty banning weapons of mass destruction from the sea-bed and the ocean floor  has been promulgated; a Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] has been signed; the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks continue; and co-operation in many other areas is being developed.\n102.\tWe can say, then, that the accomplishments of the United Nations, limited though they may be attest to the fact that man has the potential to attain a wholesome functioning world community. Because of those accomplishments and developments, and because my country believes that man possesses great potential for good, the liberian delegation calls upon this session of the General Assembly to take a new look at the world situation, to seize the opportunity for achieving a more viable and cohesive world order and to take concrete and meaningful measures towards the realization of the objectives of the United Nations Charter.\n103.\tThe world is at present faced with a number of pressing issues that require urgent attention.\n104.\tThe developing countries are continuing to experience a deterioration in the terms of trade, with world prices for their primary commodities falling steadily while those of the manufactured goods they import, including essential capital and consumer goods, are constantly rising. By paying more and more for imports from the developed countries and obtaining less and less for their primary exports, the developing countries are placed in a position where they are unable to cope adequately with such essential problems as malnutrition, poverty, hunger, disease, ignorance, family planning and pollution, which inescapably and adversely affect the wholesome functioning of the society of man.\n105.\tThis is an international problem, and like all other international problems it requires an international solution. While it is agreed that self-help is the key to progress, the developing countries cannot \\\"go it alone\\\". They need substantial and meaningful assistance from the developed countries which would serve further to stimulate sustained growth and development.\n106.\tIf we are to avoid a confrontation between the rich and the poor countries, a confrontation that might even dwarf the erstwhile confrontation between the superPowers, then the international community will have to make every effort to narrow the gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\", for hunger, poverty, disease and ignorance provide fertile soil for the seeds of violent revolution, challenging and possibly destroying the very foundations of organized society\n107.\tIt is clear that this august body must act with urgency to improve the economic condition of the developing countries. This requires nothing less than a complete re-examination of the existing economic policies of the developed countries as regards trade, foreign aid and development. Empty pronouncements and token gestures will no longer suffice.\n108.\tThe international community must come to grips with the problems of racism in Africa. Of all the social ills in the world today, this is the most pernicious to the society of man. An individual who finds himself at the bottom of a social ladder can with some assistance work his way up. If he is experiencing difficulties because of his political views he can change those views, or pretend to change them, and return to the fold. But when a man is discriminated against because of his race-and blacks are proud of their race and make no apologies here for it he is being victimized for something he is not in a position to change. This victimization, when combined with racial pride, generates hatred, frustration, and, in some instances, aggression. It might be useful to add, in this context, that racial antagonism and actual warfare have a similar effect on the world community: they destroy the basis for co-operation and mutual understanding among members of the human race.\n109.\tFor our part, we believe racial discrimination should be condemned wherever it is practiced, be it on the continent of Africa, in North America, in Australia or anywhere else on the globe. Certainly, such a die-hard attitude has no place in twentieth-century thinking.\n110.\tIn this connexion, the principal trading partners of South Africa have a special responsibility to the world community because it is they who give support and succor to the racist regime of that country. If Vorster and his henchmen did not rely on the support of certain Powers which seem to place a higher premium on short-term profits than on human dignity, South Africa would never have defied the United Nations for so long with such impunity.\n111.\tIt matters not whether the level of trade which a particular country carries on with the racist regime is small in comparison with total international trade. It is immaterial what circumstances gave rise to the country's trade with, and investment in, South Africa. Nor is it relevant that trade is limited to a particular scarce commodity such as chrome, or that the countries involved are loud and persistent in their protestations of interest in Africa and friendship for the nations and peoples of the continent. The fact of the matter is that the United Nations has called on all its Members to exercise effective economic and related sanctions against the illegal regime. The peoples and countries of Africa also have called upon their good friends and well-wishers everywhere to support the cause for which they are striving and, accordingly, the decisions and resolutions of this Organization. We have no alternative, then, but to decry and to condemn all those who trade with the racist regime, even though they may be our professed friends.\n112.\tConnected with the problem of racism in Africa is that of colonialism and minority domination on the continent. Here again, those countries that place a higher premium on trade with Portugal, South Africa and the rebel regime of Rhodesia than on freedom and justice cannot escape responsibility for the continued existence of this problem in Africa.\n113.\tLiberia has contributed and will continue to contribute to the limits of its capability towards the total liberation of Africa from the shackles of colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism. We are determined to support our oppressed brothers in southern Africa and Guinea (Bissau) until total victory is achieved. There can be no compromise in this area.\n114.\tWe are committed to majority rule in Rhodesia, Angola, Namibia, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), and we believe that the future realization of freedom in those areas depends upon the preparedness of the United Nations to take those measures that will ensure the exercise of the right of self-determination and the right to independence of the peoples living under colonial oppression and discrimination. However, should the United Nations renegue in its obligation and commitment, then no choice is left to people who are denied equal rights and are suffering under the yoke of colonialism but to liberate themselves from that blight by resort to force. We therefore call upon ail freedom-loving peoples to lend their moral and material assistance to the freedom-fighters in Africa in an effort to rid their respective fatherlands of the shackles of colonial domination and oppression.\n115.\tThe problems of pollution must be solved if man is to succeed in preventing this planet from becoming uninhabitable.\n116.\tCurrent trends suggest that it may well take the collective menaces and mass consequences arising from the world's scientific and technological strides to bind together all nations, enhance peaceful co-operation and surmount, in the face of physical danger, the political obstacles to mankind's unity. In the face of this pending reality man must accept that the earth he inhabits is his home, and consequently its surroundings must be made clear and kept wholesome.\n117.\tCurrent efforts by the international community to encourage and assist action by governments and international organizations designed to protect and improve the human environment and to remedy and prevent its impairment, continue to have full endorsement and full support.\n118.\tThe international campaign of action to protect and improve the human environment must include, as a matter of necessity and priority, particularly in developing countries, specific national programs designed to enable the developing countries to forestall the occurrence of such problems of unfavorable and, at times, dangerous conditions of the environment as those experienced in developed countries because of their programs of mass scientific and technological explosions.\n119.\tThe plan of work for international action to protect man's habitat on earth approved by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm last June,  in which my country fully participated, has taken into account some of our own fears on how to combat this new chapter of a major human problem, caused by the application by man of his knowledge of science and technology in disregard for his environment.\n120.\tPopulation control, clean air and water, the conservation of natural and other resources, regulated growth rate, restrained technological ingenuity and disarmament are some of the means whereby man might be able to undo his worst handiwork not only for the sake of survival, but also to optimize the quality of life throughout the entire human environment. The one object of all of this must be to raise the level of human existence from mere survival to fulfillment.\n121.\tWe share also the sentiment of those who say that the timing of establishing an international plan and machinery to safeguard the human environment constitutes an achievement by itself. In the implementation of the plan, much is expected from those States that have achieved vast results in the application of science and technology. The assistance and guidance they will give to this endeavor will define in the future the limit of progress to be achieved.\n122.\tHowever, if we should hold the developed countries to a higher degree of responsibility and, at the same time, require of them guidance and assistance, it should be equally binding on the developing countries to submit to the appropriate authority of the United Nations a full description of their national programs of action, including legislation, to protect the human environment and to submit annual reports on the implementation of those programs. And incidentally, as was just said by the illustrious speaker from India who preceded me, let us not use the excuse of the human environment and the avoidance of pollution in order not to give support to developing countries.\n123.\tThe kidnapping of diplomatic representatives and foreign nationals and the threat posed to international civil aviation by hijacking, sabotage and other criminal acts are of concern to the Government and people of Liberia. Of equal concern are the acts of terrorism perpetrated against innocent civilians, far removed from, and in no way involved with, the problems which allegedly gave rise to such acts.\n124.\tNo one can deny that those who are engaged in the struggle for freedom and justice are striving for a noble cause. However, there is a difference between those against whom a war of liberation is being waged and those who are not involved.\n125.\tThe Liberian delegation, accordingly, calls upon all nations to ratify existing conventions designed to prevent crimes against civil aviation, to take appropriate steps to ensure that those found guilty of such offenses are severely punished, to take measures for effective sanctions against countries which harbor or make martyrs of such persons, and to give due consideration to the objectives and purposes of the draft convention submitted at this session of the United Nations General Assembly to deal with and control acts of terrorism [A/C. 6jL. 850].\n126.\tThe Middle East problem must be solved so that the peoples in that troubled area of the world can live in peace and harmony, and not in conflict and discord. As a peace-loving State, maintaining friendly ties with the parties to the conflict, Liberia is deeply concerned that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has not yet been implemented. We therefore call on all parties to implement that resolution and to give their full support and co-operation to the Jarring mission so that negotiations may be undertaken at an early date by the parties directly concerned.\n127.\tIn harmony with a basic objective of the United Nations, we must find new approaches to save mankind from the scourge of war. Apart from the points which I have already enumerated and which are, in the view of my delegation, constructive approaches to a meaningful world peace, Liberia supports the call for a world disarmament conference. The objective of the conference should be to adopt realistic and effective measures aimed at eliminating all types of nuclear weapons and achieving general and complete disarmament under effective international control. It is in the interest of mankind that the spiraling arms race should be brought to an immediate halt. A number of achievements in the field of disarmament were witnessed in the decade of the 1960s, thus providing proof that progress in the elimination of nuclear weapons and towards general and complete disarmament is within the grasp of the international community.\n128.\tIt is the view of the Government of Liberia that, in pursuance of this effort to update procedures and the machinery dealing with the question of disarmament, a world disarmament conference should be established as an important body of the United Nations.\n129.\tWars are caused by men, but more particularly they are caused by men who are national leaders. If, then, wars are to be prevented and if mankind is to be freed for all time from that scourge, then men must be stopped from starting wars of aggression. My delegation is convinced that unless and until the international community can study the human factors which precipitate wars, and can find an effective means-whether by sanctions, ostracism or otherwise to prevent men and leaders from starting wars, the problem will persist. After all, wars solve no problems; they only create new ones.\n130.\tThe Declaration of the Rights of the Child was unanimously adopted by the United Nations in 1959 [resolution 1386 (XIV)]. The Liberian Government must lay stress on principles 2 and 7, regarding the best interest of the child, and principle 6, which stipulates that the child \\\"shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents, and, in any case, in an atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security\\\". In the world today, the cruel act of war has deprived millions of children of these basic principles. Further, at the fifty-second session of the Economic and Social Council, the Council considered, among other things, within the framework of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on Human Rights, questions concerning the protection of women and children in times of emergency and armed conflict and the status of the unmarried mother, particularly with regard to children born out of wedlock. Adoption represents one of the most satisfactory answers to the type of problems just indicated.\n131.\tSocio-economic conditions throughout the world are changing rapidly, and all governments should be aware of the effects of these socio-economic conditions on population trends. The Liberian Government has a special interest in the population problems of the world, especially the developing world, and sees a clear link with some of its own demographic problems; furthermore, it has always supported efforts aimed at the settlement of problems that affect mankind as a whole. Liberia thus took the initiative to request the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly of the new item entitled \\\"United Nations conference for a world convention on adoption law\\\" [A/8751]. We crave the due and timely consideration and support of Members of this new item during this session and full participation at the conference if and when it is convened.\n132.\tFinally, the Charter of the United Nations opens with the stirring words: \\\"We the peoples\\\". These words, in my opinion, indicate the intention of the founders of the United Nations that all the peoples of the world should be deeply and totally involved in the achievement of its basic objectives. It is my delegation's firm opinion, and I am convinced, that unless and until we strive to have all the people of the world involved in the activities and programs and in the realization of the objectives for which the United Nations was founded this basic hope and objective will never be achieved. But how can this involvement be realized? I suggest that there are, among other means, at least two ways to achieve this objective. The first is to ensure that at the earliest possible moment all the nations and all the peoples of the world are represented in the United Nations. It is true that the Charter has laid down basic requirements for membership in the Organization, but it seems that political and diplomatic machinations have for many years kept a large segment of the world's population out of the Organization. Even today, although a nation has met all the basic requirements spelled out in the Charter for admission to this world Organization, its admission can be effectively prevented. If the words \\\"We the peoples\\\" are to be given substance in reality, then the political machinations by which nations and peoples are excluded from the Organization must be brought to a dramatic halt. We believe that the effectiveness of the Organization can be assured only when all the people of the world and all the nations of the world are effectively within the fold of this international, planetary organization. -\n133.\tHowever, there is another context in which I believe the peoples of the world should become totally involved in the Organization; and that is through their personal, financial support of its existence and effectiveness.\n134.\tOne of the most serious problems that threaten the very survival of the Organization is a financial one. All of us know that the arrears reflected in the Organization's books have continued to mount steadily for a number of years. All of us are aware that in times of crisis the Secretary-General is hamstrung. He cannot take immediate and effective measures to cope with such problems and crises, because funds are not available to him for such purposes. We are also painfully aware that this great world Organization is suffering from a fiscal and budgetary deficit of a few million dollars, with no clear indication of how this embarrassing deficit will be met. The situation has reached proportions where we believe strenuous and immediate measures are needed to rescue the Organization from this financial crisis and to strengthen the hands of the Secretary-General in cases of emergency.\n135.\tIn the light of the foregoing, my Government believes that positive action should be taken immediately to improve the worsening financial condition of the Organization. My delegation, accordingly, proposes that the United Nations should undertake a world-wide appeal to all the people of the world: to every boy and girl, every man and woman, every foundation, every business and every organization, to make financial contributions, in any amount, to a special United Nations fund, which might be known and referred to as \\\"The Secretary-General's Special Fund\\\" or by any other appropriate nomenclature. Such an appeal would involve all the people of the world in the Organization. It would be truly \\\"We the peoples\\\". The fund itself would provide liquidity to the Organization; it would enable prompt and effective action to be taken by the Secretary-General in cases of emergency wherever they may occur; it would contribute to the establishment of additional disaster preparedness centres at strategic points throughout the world; and it would enable the Secretary- General of the United Nations to act speedily and effectively when the need arises, to take such initiatives as particular circumstances may warrant, and to lose no opportunity that may present itself to him, for achieving the aims and objectives of the Organization.\n136.\tThere are three particular thrusts to this proposal: firstly, the involvement of all the peoples of the world in the Organization; secondly, the achievement and maintenance of the liquidity of the Organization; and, thirdly, the strengthening of the hand of the Secretary-General for effective action at all times. It is my understanding that the people of the world number about 4 billion. If that is correct and if the Members of the United Nations and the whole world give such an appeal their full moral support and an average contribution of, say, 10 cents from each person in the world were achieved, as it might be if the appeal were well planned and a campaign for it properly organized, I daresay that within a few years the Secretary- General's hand would be strengthened by an amount of about $400 million.\n137.\tMy delegation urges that due consideration should be given this proposal and, if it seems appropriate, that the Secretary-General should be called upon to study the proposal in greater detail and to make recommendations for its early implementation.\n138.\tAs I come to the end of this statement, I should like to take cognizance of the fact that this Assembly represents the might and power of the world as well as its weaknesses and deficiencies. It embraces units of varying strengths and levels of development, of divergent views and interests, and of diverse problems and conditions. However, in spite of these varied conditions and notwithstanding these impediments, this Organization provides the most practical framework for all of us to work together to achieve peace, the paramount objective for which this Organization was founded. It is our view that, if our civilization is to survive, and if man is not to be reduced from his proud status as cultural man to that of a mere biological animal, we must, in the words of the Charter, endeavor \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\".\n139.\tLet us, therefore, subordinate our differences to the higher values of peace; let us emphasize our strengths as an Organization; and. let us learn to work and live together. We have no other choice.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I take it to be my honour and privilege to convey the greetings and best wishes of my Sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra, for the success of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n166.\tI should like to convey, on behalf of my delegation, our most sincere congratulations to you on your election as President of the General Assembly. I take particular pleasure in noting that in electing you as the President, the Assembly has given a befitting recognition and honor to you as a distinguished statesman of a great country. I have no doubt, Mr. President, that you will bring to bear on the work of the Assembly the benefits of your vast knowledge and experience, which you have gained in your varied and distinguished career. I would like to extend, on behalf of my delegation, the assurances of our full co-operation to you in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities.\n167.\tMy delegation would like to put on record our deep appreciation of the distinguished services of the outgoing President of the Assembly, Mr. Adam Malik, who has discharged his functions as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly in a most exemplary manner.\n168.\tThis year we come to the United Nations with renewed hopes for peace. It has been a year of positive and promising developments in the area of international relations.\n169.\tOf all the recent developments, the termination of the policy of isolation directed against China carried great importance. With a land mass of continental proportion and a society of 800 million people, resurgent and vibrant, China is destined to play a major role in the international relations of our time. Last year we had the honor to welcome the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. While the participation of China has considerably increased the effectiveness of the United Nations, its presence has made the Organization nearly universal.\n170.\tPresident Nixon's visit to China, unprecedented as it was in itself, has opened great vistas of fruitful co-operation and meaningful understanding between these two great countries. It has demonstrated in unmistakable terms the possibility of a rapprochement which would greatly help relax tension in the world. My delegation sincerely hopes that in their own interest, as well as in the interest of the world as a whole, both China and the United States will continue to pursue their search for better understanding and co-operation.\n171.\tSimilarly, the detente now seen between the Soviet Union and the United States is a welcome development President Nixon's recent visit to the Soviet Union and his meetings with the top leaders of that country has undoubtedly brought the two countries closer in approach and understanding. The various bilateral agreements signed in Moscow have opened a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. The co-operation in the fields of science and technology, and in the areas of environmental protection, space exploration and commercial relations would certainly help to create an atmosphere of positive co-operation, trust and understanding between these two countries.\n111. Of all the agreements recently signed in Moscow, the one resulting from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, is of great importance. Though in itself it may not have far-reaching consequences, it marks a new breakthrough in disarmament negotiations. A good beginning has been made in Moscow and I hope that this will* lead to serious attempts by both sides to reach a further understanding towards a more secure and peaceful world.\n173. My delegation is happy to note that the political climate of Europe continues to grow better. The ratification by the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany of its treaties with the Soviet Union and Poland are encouraging steps towards a real and lasting peace between the countries of East and West Europe. Two world wars during the first half of this century erupted from Europe. It is only appropriate that the European nations should strive hard to resolve their differences and work for the attainment of a durable peace.\n174.\tThe atmosphere of detente has spread to other parts of the world as well. The futility of the policy of confrontation and conflict is now being increasingly realized. The leaders of India and Pakistan met recently in Simla to discuss mutual problems. Though there could not be complete agreement on many outstanding issues, their decision to resolve problems through negotiation in the future is no small achievement, bearing in mind the recent war. We welcome these developments. We are most hopeful that our two neighbors will soon be able to find a peaceful solution to their problems.\n175.\tWe also welcome the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Tanaka, to the People's Republic of China. We hope this meeting between Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Chou Enlai will help bring these two great countries closer in understanding and future co-operation.\n176.\tWe are following with great interest the direct talks between North and South Korea though they are still in a preliminary phase. Nepal has always believed that, in solving bilateral problems, there is no better substitute for direct talks. We hope that the two parts of Korea will bring a mutually agreeable solution to the problem.\n177.\tDespite these healthy developments in other parts of the world, the situation in the Middle East and the war in Viet-Nam remain matters of serious concern. It has been almost five years since Security Council resolution 242 (1967) was adopted. This resolution provides a reasonable basis for the settlement of the Middle East problem. But despite the efforts of Mr. Gunnar Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and the talks between the representatives of the big Powers, the resolution still remains unimplemented and the situation is as volcanic as it was before. The recent developments in the Middle East make us all the more conscious of the dangers in the area. We have the framework; the only thing required is to accept and execute it. In the absence of direct talks between the parties, we hope that they will co-operate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his renewed bid to bring them together to resolve the stalemate.\n178.\tIt is unfortunate that the war in Viet-Nam still continues unabated. The sorrow and suffering caused by this war have been a source of great concern to all of us. We have always maintained that all the parties concerned in Indochina must find a political solution for the settlement of their problems through peaceful negotiations and that the countries of Indochina should be able to decide their ultimate destiny without any foreign intervention. We feel that the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the soil of Viet-Nam is the first necessary step towards the settlement of the Vietnamese problem.\n179.\tThis decade has also been designated as the Dis-armament Decade by the General Assembly [resolution 2602 (XXIV)]. The armaments race is both the cause and consequence of the atmosphere of fear and distrust that we now have in the world. It is essential to halt the arms race to restore the climate of confidence and co-operation among nations. Furthermore, the armaments build-up has not only increased capacity for destruction but it has also diverted resources that could have been used for the promotion of peace and the acceleration of development around the world.\n180.\tMotivated by these basic conclusions, the United Nations has from the beginning attached great importance to the problem of disarmament. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the recent Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction are no small achievements. However, these steps, important as they may be, are far from adequate. They have a built-in weakness. The test-ban Treaty cannot be effective unless it is comprehensive as well as universal. The Convention cannot be considered complete so long as it does not include chemical weapons as well. We hope that the major Powers, which have the resources and responsibility, will take a meaningful initiative for the regulation and reduction of armaments which, as we all know, by their very existence dangerously threaten peace and security, promote discord and distrust among nations and retard the development process of the world as a whole.\n181.\tIn our view, the only sure path leading to the conditions necessary for lasting peace among nations is through complete disarmament. We have always supported the idea of convening a world disarmament conference in which all nations, including divided nations, should be invited to participate.\n182.\tIn southern Africa there still remain the vestiges of the colonial anachronism and the manifestation of the worst form of racial discrimination. In Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), the Portuguese authorities have been ruthless in suppressing the legitimate aspirations of the majority of the People to freedom and self-government. They have also continuously defied world public opinion and rudely rejected the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)].\n183.\tIt is no longer a secret that Portuguese colonialism has been able to sustain itself in the heart of Africa because of the economic and military support it receives from its Western allies and from the racist regime of South Africa. The South African regime follows a policy of discrimination and ruthless suppression on the basis of the color and the racial origin of the people. Consequently, the majority of the people have been denied their basic rights and are subjected to constant humiliation and harassment. In open defiance of United Nations resolutions, the Government of South Africa has not only intensified its repressive measures based on the hated policy of apartheid, but it has also extended the racist policy to the adjoining United Nations Territory of Namibia. The arms embargo imposed by the Security Council against South Africa has not been effective. We urge the major trading partners of South Africa to give up the profit motive, to honor Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and to terminate their economic collaboration with a regime which\nhas no respect for the fundamental values of human life. In the meantime, it is our sacred duty to extend active assistance to help the oppressed people of South Africa combat racism and racial discrimination.\n184.\tWhile discussing the problems in southern Africa, we cannot overlook the dangerous situation that has now i developed in Southern Rhodesia. The present racist regime, I after taking over the administration unilaterally and illegally, has launched a policy of discrimination and oppression of the majority. The fate of the people of Zimbabwe is no better than that of their brethren in South Africa and in the Portuguese colonial territories. Even the mandatory sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the illegal regime have often been circumvented by some Western countries. The United Kingdom, as an administering Power, has abdicated its responsibilities towards the people of Zimbabwe by refusing to use effective means to bring down the illegal regime of Ian Smith. Unless sanctions are effectively implemented and power is transferred to the majority as soon as possible, Southern Rhodesia is likely to remain a constant threat to peace. The situation also challenges the effectiveness of the United Nations as a peace-keeper since the mandatory measures taken by the Security Council have failed to restore the minimum rights of the majority.\n185.\tOur delegation attaches great importance to the conference on the law of the sea proposed for next year. Questions concerning the continental shelf, territorial waters and deep-sea fishing have been a constant source of friction among many countries of the world. Those problems, which have preoccupied the minds of men for a considerable time, should be solved. Moreover, it is only fair that all the countries of the world coastal as well as land-locked should share the immense wealth that lies in the sea-bed and subsoil thereof as it is the common heritage of all mankind.\n186.\tClosely associated with the problem of the law of the sea is the right of the land-locked countries to access to the sea. My delegation strongly pleads for the consideration by the proposed conference of the right of land-locked countries to guaranteed free passage to and from the sea.\n187.\tIn consonance with the Lusaka Declaration, General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), reading the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, is a necessary step toward the strengthening of conditions of peace and freedom in the zone. The Indian Ocean, which has traditionally been a zone of peace, has for some time past been the scene of a great naval build-up, which does not contribute to the creation of peace in the zone. My delegation fully supports the General Assembly resolution of last year, and hopes that all countries will adhere to it and act in deference to its guiding spirit.\n188.\tThese are some of the vital political areas which could threaten world peace and security. These are all sore and sensitive spots. However, it is now being increasingly realized that the major threat to peace comes from the \ndeteriorating economic situation of the world. The ever- widening gap between the rich and the poor nations is in the long run bound to lead to confrontation between the developing and the developed countries. Speaking of the existing disparity between the rich and the poor countries, a former President of this Assembly, Mr. Lester Pearson, recently warned, \\\"We may have 10 years left in which to being correcting this imbalance. This is, if we are to act in time.\\\"\n189.\tThe least developed among the developing countries are more than others confronted by the increasing gulf between them and the relatively developed countries. My delegation would therefore like to stress that a concrete solution should be devised which would ameliorate the difficult situation of such nations by bridging the gap not only between the rich and the poor nations but also between developing nations at various stages of economic and social development. A decade would be too short a time to enable the least-developed nations to acquire the capacity to catch up with the prevalent pace of economic development of the relatively developed countries unless special measures were adopted to help them.\n190.\tTo highlight the development problem and to accelerate the development process, the General Assembly has adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. The Strategy sets forth in considerable detail the targets for economic and social progress for the present decade. It emphasizes the need for a co-ordinated international effort to come to grips with malnutrition, unemployment and ignorance in poorer countries and with the growing economic gaps which have brought about an increase in tensions. But despite the adoption of the Strategy, the less developed countries in general continue to face difficulties in the way of their planned economic development because of the prospect of an over-all decrease in external assistance. The target of a net flow of 1 per cent set by the United Nations is not being fulfilled by many rich countries. The present flow of aid to developing countries from all bilateral and multilateral sources amounts to less than $7,000 million a year as compared to $200,000 million a year spent on armaments. In their efforts to eliminate poverty, disease and ignorance, the less developed countries would at the initial phase need the transfer of technology and capital from the advanced countries on a large scale. Otherwise, as we have seen in the past, the process of development will continue to be very, very slow.\n191.\tWe in Nepal have launched a national strategy for economic development in the 1970s. We have of course, in co-ordination with the Second Development Decade, fixed our priorities according to national needs and resources. We need co-operation from outside in some priority sectors. The nation as a whole, under the dynamic leadership of His Majesty the King, is confident of success in bringing about a rapid transformation in the socio-economic life of our people.\n192.\tTechnical and economic aid is vital, but the importance of international trade cannot be under-estimated. It is the source that could provide a sustained economic growth to any country. We attach great importance to the promotion of our international trade. No nation could have favorable terms of trade unless it has access to different markets and a choice of products to export. Therefore the diversification of trade in terms of market as well as of products has been the major concern of His Majesty's Government in recent years.\n193.\tWe participated in all three sessions of UNCTAD and have explained our position and the difficulties we are facing in promoting our international trade. While favorable terms of trade are very essential for all the developing countries, transit facilities are a prerequisite for diversifying the international trade of the land-locked countries. It is gratifying that the third session of UNCTAD has recognized that fact. The Convention on Transit Trade o! ;_and-locked States  has yet to be signed by some coastal countries. We hope the importance of this Convention to land-locked countries will be realized by all and that those countries which have not acceded to it will be able to do so as early as possible.\n194.\tThe recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, was a useful first step towards realizing the need for planned action and concerted efforts to protect nature and the environment. The world can no longer remain indifferent to the multifarious problems created by pollution. There is a limit beyond which the natural environment of our earth cannot withstand the tremendous pressure to which it is subjected.\n195.\tWhile environmental problems have been created as a result of excessive industrialization and urbanization in developed countries, they have been caused by the indiscriminate use of natural resources in the developing countries. The protection of the human environment is, therefore, a problem faced by both developed and developing countries, though in different aspects and patterns. My delegation feels that this problem should be tackled in a planned and systematic way through regular machinery such as an intergovernmental committee on the human environment.\n196.\tOur past efforts to achieve conditions of peace and security through the United Nations have often been frustrated. Consequently there is a tendency to downgrade the United Nations, as has rightly been pointed out by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al8701/Add.l, p. 2]. Earlier I mentioned some of the critical problems to which the United Nations has been unable to provide effective solutions. But still, as His Majesty, our late King Mahendra, observed while addressing this august body at the twenty-second session: \\\"So far as we are concerned, the only real alternative to the United Nations is an even more powerful United Nations\\\" [1595th meeting, para. 16]. The very basis of the existence of an Organization such as this is the vital need for it. That is as true today as it was 27 years ago. With all its weaknesses, this Organization is the only hope of mankind for the creation of conditions in which all countries will be able to work for economic and social progress without the threat of war.\n"

        "file_text": "His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, our First Minister, detained by his many obligations, having been unable to come this year to the rostrum to plead the cause of\\\" Laos as he has done each year, has entrusted to me the honor of representing him before this Assembly. Mr. President, allow me, on the occasion of your election, to extend the warm congratulations of Laos. In entrusting to you the burdensome task of presiding over its debates and of directing its proceedings, the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly wished to pay a tribute, first to your qualities as a diplomat, and, next, to your country, Poland, and to the courage of its people and to the realism of its leaders. My country has maintained cordial relations with your country since the Geneva Agreements of 1954, which judiciously appointed the International Supervisory Commission, of which Poland is one of the three members.\n2.\tI should also like to pay a sincere tribute to your predecessor Mr. Adam Malik, who, in an atmosphere of unrest, presided over our debates at the twenty-sixth session with firm and tranquil authority. That distinguished statesman, who has worked so hard for the cause of peace and stability in South-east Asia, also succeeded in arousing general respect and admiration to the benefit of our Organization. He deserves our grateful thanks.\n3.\tI should now like to turn to our new Secretary-General, to congratulate him on his tireless efforts over the past year to inculcate a universal awareness and a new public spirit, everywhere in the world, in order to rouse this Organization from its chronic passivity. With the admission of the People's Republic of China, our Organization has caught its breath and taken a major step towards the universality so much desired by all.\n4.\tWhile concern and hope impel each of us to speak of peace in this Assembly, it is in fact violence which has predominated over the past year. In our Asia of monsoons, where we have had the dubious distinction of being the star, war has been raging for 10 years now, with ever- increasing violence, extending the conflict to the limits of IndoChina. In the Middle East where the state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" persists, where the situation is blocked, the fever of adventurism is increasing the danger of a confrontation. Elsewhere, in Africa, a situation of veiled conflict, born of the aftermath of colonialism, is not about to improve. The world is tainted with violence. Like the revolutions of yesteryear, terrorism is now exported across frontiers. No continent has been spared its outbursts of anger, riots, repression, assassinations, killings, and so forth. There is no longer any haven of peace anywhere. A whole range of terrorist techniques, from aerial hijackings to attempted assassinations by remote control, or even through the post, has been developed and perfected, causing suffering and bloodshed to innumerable innocent victims. Obstinacy on the one hand, and hatred on the other, have created this kind of dialectic of despair which has impelled men to commit crimes of a new kind, far more dangerous because more insidious. Neither is there any assurance that these sacrifices, voluntary or involuntary, have done anything to bring about a real change in the balance of force or changed the real course of events.\n5.\tAs Buddhists, we strongly condemn these acts of terrorism regardless of their motives, because they lead directly to hatred, because they inject the virus of blind terror and, quite simply, because they lead to an erosion of international morality. But in the midst of these tempests, reefs and difficulties which rise in our path, visible signs of a rational order founded on a desire for peace and co-operation are beginning to appear.\n6.\tLast year, our delegation declared that it approached the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly with a little more hope than in previous years. This feeling was based on specific observations. Since then bold, courageous and politically very wise initiatives have borne out our \nhopes. Truly, the world today has the clear impression that the winds of history are veering around since the great Powers, some of them once resolutely antagonistic, are finally agreeing on principles which could give them a breathing space. This process of active detente and ideological accommodation after the summit meetings at Peking and Moscow has given rise to tremendous hopes everywhere. The recent meeting between Prime Ministers Chou Enlai and Tanaka in Peking, the echo of which was heard across .the world, will certainly have beneficial effects in Asia.\n7.\tWe are thus far from the age when the great Powers were living virtually behind barricades, with weapons directed against potential aggressors, and the latter doing the same against their potential opponents.\n8.\tThe fine language of diplomacy was adorned with invective and sombre prophecies, although such prophecies were always given the lie by facts. The international climate was stifling and dangerous. Small nations looked with astonishment and anguish on the awesome eagerness of blocs and clans to predict the catastrophes which stalked this or that social system, to vaunt the merits of this or that system, as more and more fantastic weapons were constantly prepared for a decisive confrontation between good and evil. For years the concert of nations had become an appalling cacophony in which threats and condemnations predominated, as in certain ancient tragedies.\n9.\tFor some time now, it has seemed that we were moving towards a more humane and less adventurist view of politics. After all, what is at stake is war or peace. Although the security of States is the golden rule of diplomacy, it must not, however, be allowed to lead straight to total annihilation. Our delegation therefore welcomes the change in the international climate and the agreements, no matter how meager, which have been attained by way of corollary. The ancient demons are, of course, difficult to exorcise. We speak from sad experience, since our unhappy kingdom has been under unceasing attack for many years by a country which is 10 times stronger. Does the Assembly still recall our statements from this rostrum concerning this indescribable aggression? Do representatives know that the Ho Chi Minh trail passes through Laos and that it has become an open road to invasion and warfare? That is an important problem which, it has often been said, is not for the United Nations to solve, since the internal affairs of States are not within its competence.\n10.\tWe say that the war in Laos, the unhappy expression of the Indo-China war, is indeed an international matter. The two conferences held on this subject were international conferences. Legal subtitles can neither conceal nor distort what is the obvious truth. Thus it is futile to speak of peace and international solidarity when small nations which have no means to defend themselves are left to their fate amid widespread indifference. When there are thousands of dead, vast destruction, hundreds of thousands of people dis-placed must legalism be the ultima ratio in this Organization, which was established to defend and demonstrate peace? There has been, quite rightly, talk of a crisis of the Organization precisely because of its inability to solve international disputes.\n11.\tThis is what the problem is ail about. Our Prime Minister expressly wrote to the Secretary-General to this effect some time ago.  He said that in his honest opinion the Organization seemed to him the natural place for the settlement of disputes. As the Secretary-General has said, we should have a collective conscience. We believe that, when peace is threatened anywhere, all of us here should be concerned and should help in the quest for equitable solutions, and not simply endorse the fait accompli to turn questioningly towards this or that capital. In the case of Laos the origin of the trouble is clear: foreign troops have invaded our territory by entire divisions on a war footing accompanied by armored vehicles and modern artillery. Is this aggression or a military outing? Does war between North and South Viet-Nam authorize the belligerents to invade a sovereign neighboring country because it is strategically more convenient to pass through Laos than to cross the seventeenth parallel? A curious hypocrisy, of which I think no one in this Assembly is unaware: the guilty hand of Hanoi, which feigns to respect one frontier in order to violate another.\n12.\tThus, does the Messianic ideology of a country place it above international law? Does political testament of a national hero permit that country on the grounds of what it calls a sacred mission, no longer to recognize and respect any border? Why must the reunification of Viet-Nam be effected at the expense of other countries? Is North Viet-Nam being attacked and invaded by the forces of Laos, Cambodia or even Viet-Nam? Of course not.\n13.\tMy country asks you to give further thought to those questions. They are indeed within our jurisdiction. They are our moral responsibility, because by the very reason of our hesitation and caution those who have committed aggression against us have been able cynically to declare that we are serving the policy of the imperialists which in their eyes justifies their deploying their divisions, without admitting it, throughout Laos and mounting the attack of which we are today the victims. Thus it is that in IndoChina and elsewhere, little by little, the principles of the Charter and the principles of Bandung are eroded; thus it is that, little by little, small nations have the feeling that their protests and statements made before the United Nations have become a purely academic exercise and, being unable to obtain justice, they had better seek other means. Thus it is that the crisis of the Organization has continued over the years. It is a crisis of conscience, and only through a galvanizing of this collective conscience, which has failed us, can our institution truly be the monument of hope.\n14.\tSo far as our country is concerned, however, we still have hope, because it is precisely in South-East Asia, which is so threatened, that the peoples are beginning to be aware of their common destiny. Nothing that happens or may hap;  in the IndoChina peninsula can be a matter of indifference to the great masses of people who live close to these warm waters, which are sailed by so many vessels, some of which have been following the same routes for decades. We would even say that the political interest is not limited to those coasts alone. So that, if we want peace in so coveted a region, it must be established soon. Laos therefore welcomed with the greatest sympathy the efforts of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore to try and find a solution to the IndoChina conflict. We have made known our feelings on this subject. A global solution must be found for all the nations concerned in the war, for there is a common IndoChinese front, which conceals and further burdens the Laotian problem by prolonging it. We also welcome with great pleasure the steps taken by the two Koreas to resolve the question of the unification of that country. Those are examples of great political wisdom by which many a belligerent should be guided. In the case of countries which were once united but which have become different States, we think that in the age in which we are living the identity of nations is such that territorial partition is an inhuman act of political surgery which can only feed rancor and hatred.\n15.\tAnd if Laos is to serve as an example, at least for the peaceful settlement of the problems of IndoChina, my delegation will recall that we were among the first to opt for neutrality when the storm was breaking upon us. Neutrality does not mean isolation although we can speak with some bitterness of the state in which our country now finds itself because of the aggression of one of its neighbors and for the reasons mentioned at the beginning of this statement. Political alignment entails ties which cannot be supported by countries which, like ours, lack the means. With the Geneva agreement of 1962  we accepted political non-alignment. We have respected our signature, while others have held theirs at naught. But non-alignment cannot itself mean an option in which aggressors and aggressed against are mingled. If non-alignment is a philosophy for a policy of peace, it is necessary to distinguish between those who send their armies to invade other countries and those who respect international frontiers. Ideology is no excuse for doing everything in order to triumph. The export of ideas by force of arms: that quite simply is what we blame the imperialists for.\n16.\tPeace requires the abandonment of unreasonable ambitions and respect for the ideas of others. If North Viet-Nam was not convinced that it was following the direction of history and that it must liberate all the neighboring peoples of old IndoChina and impose, with its friends, a regime which it regards as the best, the most just and the most humane, it would not have invaded our country. It must be recognized that millions of people are resisting because the attitudes of the North VietNamese have not won the unanimous support of the Laotian and Khmer peoples. North Viet-Nam is quite simply throwing down a challenge to the international community by carrying the war into Laos, allegedly to struggle against the imperialists, who have never entered the country, whereas the first North VietNamese battalions were already in place, having entered our national territory in strength. It is therefore certainly the intention to destroy our society, the monarchy and the institutions which we have established with the assistance of our people and in complete freedom. For two decades we have been denouncing this aggression, which is an insult to law and to international agreements. Our delegation can state that the Royal Government of\nLaos has done everything in its power to settle its disputes with the Neo Lao Hak Xat, the political party created and maintained by the Hanoi Government. Recently, again, we accepted the five points of the Lactam Patriotic Front as a basis for discussion. We propose that the use of firearms should be immediately halted under strict and impartial international control. We have reason to believe that if the North VietNamese will ease their pressure and withdraw from our country, the Lao of all parties will soon settle their disputes. The latest messages exchanged between the two Princes seem to mark a step forward in the patient and continuous search for a dialog opening the way to the reconciliation and harmony desired by all.\n17.\tThe negotiations taking place between the principal interlocutors hold out prospects for peace which seem better now than they ever were in the past. May they lead to a global solution of all the IndoChinese problems, so that those peoples, decimated by interminable and now pointless struggles, may recover their identity in peace and reconciliation.\n18.\tOur contribution to peace is, therefore, sincere, loyal and continuous. We have given specific and repeated proof of that. The Government of Hanoi alone has opposed it, through the Neo Lao Hak Xat, which is now prisoner of its political choice.\n19.\tIf there is any collective conscience in this Organization it must now awaken and become aware of Laotian realities. It is a matter of urgency that, as we said last year,\n\\\"It is imperative for all international bodies which are mindful of the need for peaceful coexistence and for the signatories to the Geneva agreements, who are responsible for their application, to decide at last to assume their fundamental responsibility.\\\" [1943rd meeting, para. 54.]\n20.\tThis year again we reiterate our wish and our appeal on behalf of the people of Laos, in the name of the sufferings they endure, in the name of the solidarity which here should unite us when one of us suffers injustice, when one of us sees with despair part of our people scattered and wandering, our towns destroyed, and murderous and arrogant foreign legions coming to lay down the law in an independent and sovereign country we reiterate our appeal for an end once and for all to the sad chapter of this long march in torment and in blood, so that we may at last together usher in the beginning of a new era of concord and peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me on behalf of the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist\nRepublic to offer you our warm congratulations on your election to the important office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to wish you every success. We are particularly gratified that this high honor has been conferred on you, the representative of a neighboring socialist country, with whose people the Ukrainian people are linked by ties of fraternal co-operation in the struggle for our common ideals.\n59.\tWe should also like to extend our greetings to the Secretary-General and express our best wishes for the success of his work.\n60.\tDespite all the differences of approach to the assessment of individual international events, the present debate highlights, as a characteristic feature of the period which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly, the undeniable fact that peaceful coexistence is becoming a palpable, living reality on our troubled planet.\n61.\tOf course, this is not a spontaneous development. It has grown out of the arduous struggle between the champions of peace and their opponents. But the idea of peaceful coexistence between State\\\", is gradually winning over more and more countries and Governments. In this connexion, it can be said that, in the final analysis, the debate in the United Nations is promoting a better understanding of positions and arguments and is helping to narrow the differences between points of view and, in a number of cases, to remove certain historical barriers on the road to mutual understanding.\n62.\tIt is clear that the peoples cannot be satisfied by mere words, no matter how high-flown and eloquent they may be.\n63.\tLife has always put actions above words, especially when questions of peace and international security are involved. In this context, it is appropriate to refer to one of the pronouncements of V. I. Lenin, the founder of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of which will be celebrated by all Soviet peoples in December of this year. Lenin said that it was precisely on such a question as the struggle for peace, which was so vitally important for all peoples, that it was desirable:\n... to see a minimum of general declarations, solemn promises and grandiloquent formulas and the greatest possible number of very simple and clear decisions and measures which might really lead to peace, if not to the complete elimination of the danger of war\\\". \n64.\tThe past year has marked a new stage in the relaxation of international tension. Quite a lot has already been done in the way of the practical and business-like, purposeful solution of questions relating to the establishment of lasting peace. This makes our hope that the principle of peaceful coexistence and non-use of force in relations between countries can and will be raised to the status of an immutable law of international life appear all the more realistic.\n65.\tThe Ukrainian SSR attributes the positive results which have been achieved principally to the successful implementation by the Soviet Union of the program of peace put forward at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the vigorous foreign policy activities of the socialist countries and to the fact that the Governments of a number of other States have adopted realistic peace-loving policies. That is why the cause of peace can now count to its credit such momentous developments as the entry into force of the treaties concluded in 1972 by the Federal Republic of Germany with the Soviet Union and with Poland, the further expansion of co-operation between the USSR and France and other States, specific action in the preparation of an all-European conference on security and co-operation, the initiative regarding the convening of a world disarmament conference, the proposal regarding the establishment of a collective security system in Asia, and so on. Special mention should be made of the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States which resulted in the conclusion between those two countries of important agreements the implementation of which will clearly serve the interests of all States and the cause of universal peace. Even those who continue to slander the Soviet Union and its peace-loving foreign policy have been compelled to acknowledge the importance of this event.\n66.\tAt this point I should like to stress that the Ukrainian people, in common with all Soviet people, ardently supports the practical measures which are being implemented by the Communist Party and the Government of the Soviet Union and by the countries of the socialist community with a view to bringing about detente and the further strengthening of peace and security.\n67.\tWe all know that the policy of peaceful coexistence does not eliminate the contradictions, particularly the ideological contradictions, between the two social systems. But the vitality and effectiveness of this policy lies in the very fact that it is designed to exclude the solution of conflicts by military means. Thus, the encouraging purport of the positive actions I have referred to gains even greater significance: they demonstrate the strength of the very principle of peaceful coexistence and they militate against those who would wish to aggravate the international situation and prevent detente.\n68.\tIn this connexion, we consider that the General Assembly can record the achievement of positive results in the implementation of the basis provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. However, we cannot fail to express our deep concern at the continued existence of hotbeds of war in various parts of the world. We think that the General Assembly might call upon all States to take effective measures to facilitate the elimination of existing hotbeds of war and prevent armed conflicts.\n69.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR holds the view that the adoption by the United Nations of the Soviet proposal on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [A/8793] would be an important political step towards a decisive diminution of the menace of war, the elimination and prevention of acts of armed aggression and the threat of a nuclear holocaust. In his statement [2040th meeting], Mr. Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, put forward exhaustive arguments in support of this important political proposal.\n70.\tThe Ukrainian delegation fully supports the Soviet draft resolution on this matter [A/L.676], and is convinced that the solution of the vitally important problems raised in it will undoubtedly meet the aspirations of all peace-loving peoples.\n71.\tAttention at this session is focused on a number of important contemporary problems, but one thing is clear: the proposal on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is of supreme importance for the whole of humanity. Indeed, if relations between States are based on the principle of the non-use of force and if at the same time there is a permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, no one will be able to resort to the use of either nuclear or conventional weapons. What will then prevent humanity from entering upon an era of lasting peace, genuine international security, and general and complete disarmament?\n72.\tOf course, we must not forget that peoples are fighting against colonial subjugation and imperialist invaders or that there exists the danger of new acts of aggression. The Soviet proposal in no way infringes upon the right of peoples to defend themselves against aggression and to carry on the struggle for national liberation, by armed force if necessary. And there is no contradiction in this, for the United Nations has also reaffirmed this right in its decisions and declarations. Thus, the Soviet proposal, advocating the prohibition of the use both of force and of nuclear weapons, takes into account the vitally important interests of all nations and States, large and small, nuclear and non-nuclear, developed and developing.\n73.\tFrom this lofty rostrum, the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR calls upon the representatives of all States Members of the United Nations to support the USSR proposal on non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons.\n74.\tNowadays, perhaps, there is no need to try to convince anyone that the establishment of a security system in Europe is the key to the strengthening of peace throughout the world. We are all aware that many of the obstacles erected by certain NATO circles to the convening of an all-European conference and the establishment of collective security in Europe have already been removed. At the Assembly of Representatives of Public Opinion for European Security and Co-operation, held at, Brussels in June, the powerful voice of the peoples of Europe cried out for a positive solution to this problem. The necessary pre-conditions have now been created for businesslike multilateral consultations on the immediate preparation and holding of the conference.\n75.\tIt is natural that the Government of every European State should make its contribution to this common effort, if it really cares about the security of its country and wishes to transform our continent into a land of peace and fruitful co-operation.\n76.\tThis is precisely the approach of the German Democratic Republic that powerful bulwark of European and world peace. We know from experience that many important world problems cannot be solved effectively without the participation of the German Democratic Republic. Moreover, the new political situation taking shape in Europe, the interests of the further strengthening of peace and international co-operation and the interests of enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations all demand, more urgently than every before, the immediate admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations. The question of the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations must be resolved at the same time.\n77.\tThe general trend towards the easing of tension and the strengthening of regional security is also having a favorable effect in other parts of the world, including Asia. Events taking place in the Far East are of significance in this respect.\n78.\tIt cannot be disputed that the interests of peace in that part of the world demand an improvement in the situation on the Korean peninsula and the reunification of Korea on a peaceful, democratic basis, without any kind of foreign interference. An important dialog is now in progress between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea. In these circumstances the United Nations should have felt itself obliged to promote the creation of conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea.\n79.\tUnfortunately, we have had a show of political nonsense. Under the influence of forces opposed to the easing of tension, the General Assembly has once again decided to postpone consideration of the Korean question until its next session. Once again the policies of those who oppose the withdrawal of the troops stationed in Korea under the United Nations flag and the dissolution of the infamous United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea have prevailed. Thus, the obstacle to the realization of the national aspirations of the Korean people has not yet been removed.\n80.\tThe flames of armed conflict on the Indian subcontinent have been extinguished. Constructive negotiations are now in progress between India and Pakistan. The further strengthening of peace and security in that part of the world will depend on good-neighborly relations between the countries in that region. As we all know, out of this dramatic situation has been born a new peace-loving State-the People's Republic of Bangladesh. We think that the opposition of those who, because of their great-Power chauvinistic ambitions, are obstructing the admission of that State to the United Nations will be overcome and that the Republic of Bangladesh will inevitably occupy its place in the United Nations.\n81.\tWe consider that the United Nations should now seek with greater energy and perseverance to achieve the elimination of existing hotbeds of aggression and to put an end to the armed conflicts unleashed by imperialism.\n82.\tThe bloody war in IndoChina continues. For the time being those who plan and carry on this war are not seeking constructive decisions to end the aggression in Viet-Nam but, rather, are trying to prolong and even escalate the war and are devising means of deceiving both their own people and international public opinion. In the guise of speeches about their peace-loving intentions they are continuously putting forward new pretexts and false arguments to justify their aggressive military actions.\n83.\tThe United States reduces the number of its land forces in South Viet-Nam, but immediately replaces them with Saigon troops. It has increased to 100,000 the total strength of the armed forces engaged in the war of extermination from the air and the sea, while the bombing of towns, villages, dikes and dams in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam is being intensified on an unprecedented scale. This is how the \\\"VietNamization\\\" program which the United States is carrying out appears in practice.\n84.\tThe aggressor should understand by now that in today's world the policy of negotiating \\\"from a position of strength\\\" is doomed to failure, for the peoples which have risen up to fight for their freedom and independence are invincible. They have on their side the socialist countries, which are rendering them aid and support in their just struggle; they also have the sympathy and support of all peace-loving peoples and the whole of progressive humanity.\n85.\tThe Ukrainian SSR is a firm advocate of the immediate cessation of aggression in Viet-Nam and of the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, and the complete and unconditional withdrawal from that part of the world of the forces of the United States and its allies. It considers that the key to a peaceful settlement of the problem of IndoChina is to be found in the constructive proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the patriotic forces of Laos and Cambodia.\n86.\tThe situation in the Middle East, which has arisen as a result of Israeli aggression, poses a threat to universal peace and international security.\n87.\tThe latest acts of aggression by the Israeli militarists against Lebanon and Syria reveal once again the expansionist nature of the policies of the Israeli Government. Using the tragic incident in Munich as a pretext for their notorious acts of \\\"retaliation\\\" and a further build-up of tension, the Israeli leaders have recently been reiterating their intention to seek \\\"substantial border changes\\\". It is no secret that Israel is able to pursue its adventurist policy and defy the United Nations thanks to the backers who render it unlimited military, financial and political aid and support. Surely they realize in Tel Aviv that no lavish hand-outs can save their reckless policy from complete failure.\n88.\tIn its demands, the Ukrainian SSR is at one with the forces of peace: the hotbed of aggression in the Middle East must be eliminated; Israeli troops must be withdrawn from the occupied territories; full recognition must be given to the independence and sovereignty of all States and to the lawful rights of all peoples in that part of the world, including the Arab people of Palestine.\n89.\tI should like to add the following to what I have already said.\n90.\tA few days ago, the General Assembly witnessed another of the routine rhetorical exercises of the Israeli Foreign Minister. Its aim was the same as before to attempt yet again to evade responsibility for the ceaseless acts of aggression against neighboring Arab States, for the terrorism and for all the crimes committed in the occupied territories.\n91.\tAs a result of the growing condemnation of policies by world public opinion, Israel finds itself in a state of increasing political isolation. It was this, no doubt, which prompted the representative of Tel Aviv to interfere once again, in a crude and impudent manner, in the internal affairs of the Soviet State by resorting to the routine fabrication, as deceitful as ever, about the alleged discrimination in the USSR against citizens of Jewish nationality.\n92.\tWe in the Ukraine say of a person who goes about making irrelevant, unfounded and absurd allegations that he \\\"pops up like a jack-in-the-box\\\". It was in just such an unenviable position that the Israeli Foreign Minister found himself.\n93.\tOur delegation attaches particular importance to the problem of disarmament. After all, it is hardly possible to talk at all seriously about genuine international security without effective disarmament measures and the cessation of the arms race. In recent years a number of useful international agreements have been concluded on arms limitation and on certain measures for partial disarmament, particularly important among which is the recently adopted Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex].\n94.\tThe question of the complete prohibition of chemical weapons is next in line.\n95.\tAs one of the sponsors of the relevant draft convention [see A/8818-DC/235, annex B (CCD/361)], submitted on 28 March 1972 by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries for consideration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, the Ukrainian SSR considers that the draft constitutes a good basis for reaching agreement. We cannot regard as tenable the positions of certain Powers which are attempting to impede the solution of the question of the prohibition of chemical weapons by bringing up various technical problems*.\n96.\tIt is the duty of the General Assembly to call upon all States to solve this problem at the earliest possible moment on the only possible basis, namely, by taking a political decision on the complete prohibition of these weapons of mass destruction. The existence of chemical weapons in the arsenals of certain States and their use against peoples fighting for their liberation make this task one of particular urgency.\n97.\tIn its reply to the Secretary-General on the question of convening a world disarmament conference, the Government of the Ukrainian SSR has set forth its views on the preparation and holding of such a conference [A/8817 annex]. We believe that, as a result of the wide-spread support for the convening of a world disarmament conference, this session of the General Assembly will consider and decide questions relating to the preparation and holding of the conference.\n98.\tThe agenda of this session includes problems connected with the peaceful use of outer space. While reserving the right to express our views on some of these problems in greater detail at a later stage, we should like to urge all delegations to support the constructive proposal of the Soviet Union on the preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting [A/8771]. The adoption of this proposal will ensure that world-wide television broadcasting is carried on with strict respect for the national sovereignty of all countries in the interests of maintaining international peace and security and strengthening co-operation among nations.\n99.\tIn their statements, many delegations have expressed concern that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], the program of action  and relevant United Nations resolutions have not yet been implemented in some parts of the world. Events in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) show that the colonialists are persisting in their attempts to crush the national liberation movement of the African peoples. The ruling circles of some Western Powers and their powerful monopolies, which have long been protecting and lending money to colonial regimes, are now quite openly rendering aid to the rulers in Pretoria, Salisbury and Lisbon, supplying them with arms and cynically violating the embargo on trade with the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.\n100.\tIn these circumstances it is essential to give further support to the forces opposed to imperialism and colonialism and to help them to intensify their struggle for the elimination of the vestiges of colonialism and racism. At the same time, the United Nations must take further decisive action to complete the process of decolonization. The United Nations could make a positive contribution to the implementation of international action in the struggle against racism and the inhuman policy and practice of racism and apartheid by adopting a convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid. It should not be forgotten that the need to conclude such a convention was recognized by the General Assembly in resolution 2786 (XXVI).\n101.\tThe developing countries find themselves in a particularly difficult situation as a result of the present acute aggravation of the crisis in the capitalist monetary system and the consequent unhealthy condition of the world economy, for the backward economies which they inherited from colonialism are heavily dependent on external markets and on external sources for many vitally important goods.\n102.\tThe Ukrainian people have learned through their own experience that the difficulties facing developing countries can be overcome by firm and consistent implementation of radical social and economic reforms and by establishing a public sector in the economy of the country and changing the structure of social production. This will create the conditions for mobilizing resources on a national scale, speeding up economic development on the basis of modern scientific and technological advances, and strengthening the position of national economies in the struggle against foreign monopolies.\n103.\tBy pursuing this policy, the Ukraine, which was formerly a backward, illiterate country, with an economy dependent on foreign capital, has been transformed during the Soviet period into a highly developed industrial Power. The founding of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a truly historic event in the destiny of our people. The selfless labor of the Ukrainian people and the brotherly friendship and mutual assistance of all the peoples of the USSR have helped the Ukraine to establish an economy in which crises are unknown, to achieve a high level of cultural development and to consolidate social relations based upon genuine social and national equality. Tremendous social reforms in the name of humanity have not been the only result of the unification of the peoples of our land into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That unification, as was rightly pointed out by Mr. Shcherbitsky, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, has shown the whole world:\n\\\"... the only true way to overcome national enmity, to abolish inequality among nations, to guarantee the free development of peoples and to achieve the firm consolidation and unification of their efforts to secure a brighter future\\\". (From his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine on 27 July 1972, published in Pravda Ukraine of 28 July 1972).\n104.\tWe are convinced that the United Nations should promote such measures as would encourage the development of international co-operation in industrial production, the development and utilization of natural resources, the protection of the human environment, and other areas of mutual interest. This is the way to raise the economic standard of all countries and achieve the further strengthening of security and trust among nations.\n105.\tAt this session, some States are still advocating the revision of the United Nations Charter. It is argued that our Charter has become \\\"obsolete\\\", and some people even assert that it does not reflect the positions of the dozens of new States which have been admitted to the United Nations since its foundation.\n106.\tThe Ukrainian SSR, one of the founder Members of the United Nations, well remembers the arduous battles against fascism in which was forged the victory which made possible the establishment of this international Organization. That victory cost our people incalculable sacrifices and sufferings. Consequently, the cause of peace and international security, a case which is fully served by the provisions of the Charter, its spirit and its letter, is especially dear to us.\n107.\tNo, it is not the \\\"obsolescence\\\" of the Charter or a revision of the Charter or a revision of its principles that we should be concerned with! A careful analysis of United Nations activities during the past 27 years will show that they might have been immeasurably more fruitful and effective if all Members had adhered unswervingly to the letter and spirit of the Charter and if all States without exception had conducted their foreign policy strictly in accordance with its principles. The shortcomings in the activities of the United Nations are not due to the Charter in its present form, but rather to violations of its provisions. The Charter cannot fail to correspond to the interests of the young developing States, for it gives legal confirmation to the progressive principles of international law equality of rights, self-determination of peoples, sovereign equality and respect for human rights the very principles which have served and continue to serve young developing States as reliable legal instruments in their struggle for genuine national independence.\n108.\tTo attempt to revise the Charter is to undermine the fundamental principles of the United Nations embodied in our Charter, which is a modern code for international co-operation between States on the basis of equality or rights.\n109.\tA number of the problems submitted for consideration at this session are of supreme importance for the cause of universal peace. They are the problems of life itself, dictated by the fundamental interests of peoples thirsting for peace, prosperity and progress. The United Nations bears a great responsibility at this time, when powerful forces of peace are compelling us to direct our efforts towards detente and the strengthening of co-operation. The Ukrainian delegation considers it the primary duty and immediate task of the United Nations at the twenty-seventh session of its General Assembly, not to let slip the opportunity to work out and adopt at this session such decisions as will promote the development of far-reaching international co-operation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first of all address to you, on behalf of the delegation of Romania, our most cordial congratulations on your election to the lofty post of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. To see the Chair occupied by a representative of socialist Poland, with which Romania maintains brotherly relations and co-operates fully in every field, is for us a matter of particular satisfaction. I wish you complete success in the discharge of the lofty mission which has been entrusted to you and I wish to assure you of the complete co-operation of the delegation of Romania.\n30.\tAt the same time, I should like to express the appreciation of the delegation of Romania to your eminent predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia.\n31.\tI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to tell the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, of our great respect for him, and of the esteem we have for him because of his activities in the service of strengthening the Organization and increasing its role in international life.\n32.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to U Thant for his untiring efforts and his devotion to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n33.\tThe participation of the Socialist Republic of Romania in international activities is based on a scientific analysis of the major changes taking place on the world stage and of the shifts occurring within the social and political forces which shape the development of the world today.\n34.\tIndeed, an objective analysis of inter-State relations reveals an increase in the strength and the prestige of the socialist countries, the ever-growing affirmation of the States engaged on the road of independent development and of other peace-loving countries, and the rising influence of peoples and public opinion on international events. At the same time, we cannot neglect the significant changes taking place in the relative share of various countries in international life as a result of the technological and scientific revolution. The participation of small and medium-sized countries is being intensified. Those countries are highly interested in an effective participation in debating and solving the major world problems for the benefit of all peoples. All these changes convincingly show that the old imperialist policy of force and diktat is consistently losing ground and that there are ever better prospects for bringing about a new policy and new relations between States so as to avoid a conflagration and to establish a lasting peace. To lay a new and democratic basis for relations between States implies the recognition and integral application at all times by all States in respect of each and every one of the fundamental principles of international law, that is to say, complete equality of rights, national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in domestic affairs, mutual benefits, non-recourse to force or to the threat of force and the right of peoples freely to decide their own destiny.\n35.\tThe entire foreign policy of Romania consistently reflects those principles. Our country places at the center of its policy the intensification of friendly relations and all types of co-operation with socialist countries. It is constantly widening its co-operative relations with countries that have embarked on the road of independent development and it is broadening its relations on many levels with all States in the world.\n36.\tIn the conditions of our contemporary world, all nations have the right to participate and have an equal interest in the solution of the major problems which confront mankind. This makes it imperative that possibilities be created so that all States, irrespective of their strength, size, potential or social system, may directly participate in choosing the ways and means of doing so and in implementing measures capable of ensuring the general progress of mankind in an atmosphere of peace and understanding. Harmonizing efforts towards the achievement of these common goals requires the establishment of broad co-operation among States and the continuous improvement of forms and methods of co-operation and of their efficiency.\n37.\tIn this respect, the United Nations and its specialized agencies have a particularly important role to play, as bodies called upon to stimulate co-operation, to work out standards to govern relations between States and to ensure their implementation.\n38.\tIt is undeniable that for some time we have witnessed a process of increasing the role of the United Nations in international life. That is an eminently positive development which should be welcomed by all of us. Nevertheless, one cannot fail to note that, at the same time and many events bear witness to this there is a growing demand on the part of Member States that the United Nations role be further strengthened. Sometimes disappointments as well as justified apprehensions are felt in connexion with a certain erosion of the prestige of our Organization. It is a matter of public notoriety that many resolutions that have been adopted in this forum have not gone beyond a declaration of intent and have not led to effective measures that have a determining influence on the course of international life. Obviously, this is a very disturbing situation, since, given the responsibilities that we have towards peoples, we cannot afford to meet every year to discuss fundamental problems while the results of those discussions are minor and often lack in finality and effectiveness.\n39.\tFrom this high rostrum the Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania addresses to all States and Governments of the world a pressing appeal to contribute their best to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and to raise its role in building a world of peace and coexistence based on understanding, friendship and international co-operation free from the specter of animosity and suspicion.\n40.\tAs stated by the President of the State Council, Nicolae Ceausescu:\n\\\"Romania has always felt that the United Nations is called upon to act in such a manner as to favor multilateral co-operation among all nations of our planet, to promote in international life relations based on full equality of rights, which would exclude the use or the threat of force in relations among States. In our opinion, in present circumstances the United Nations can exercise a more important role in this regard.\\\"\n41.\tIs is precisely these imperatives of our time and the responsibility that is incumbent upon us as Members of an Organization in which peoples have placed so much hope that prompted the Government of Romania to request inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of an item entitled, \\\"Strengthening of the role of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security, the development of co-operation among all nations and the promotion of the rules of international law in relations between States\\\". We wish to express our satisfaction at the fact that, thanks to your support this proposal has become an item on the agenda of the plenary Assembly [item 24].\n42.\tOur initiative proceeds from the widely recognized need for the United Nations to act more firmly for the achievement of the goals inscribed in the Charter and for the observance and universal implementation of the fundamental principles of international law, and to see to it that all States refrain in their relations from the use or threat of force, from any pressure or constraint. The initiative also proceeds from the need to encourage the settlement of existing or potential disputes between States exclusively by peaceful means.\n43.\tIt is absolutely imperative that, in the fulfillment of its essential task to maintain and strengthen peace, the United Nations should contribute effectively to preventing and eliminating hotbeds of tension and conflict, to securing the conditions required for the free and independent development of all Member States, and to preventing the violation on any pretext of the sovereignty of any of them.\n44.\tAny infringement of the independence and sovereignty of a State must be regarded as incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and as entailing appropriate consequences and measures. The Organization is also bound to contribute in a more substantial way to the achievement of disarmament, the liquidation of colonialism and neo-colonialism and the reduction of existing gaps, and give greater support to the efforts of the developing countries with a view to ensuring their economic and social progress.\n45.\tIn the last decades there have been deep transformations in the configuration of our contemporary world. The effectiveness of United Nations action depends to the largest extent on the Organization's ability adequately to express the realities of our time. Consequently, the forms of activity and the very structure of the Organization should reflect these new realities. It is in this context that the need is felt to ensure the widest possible participation of States, by virtue of the principle of universality, in the elaboration and implementation of decisions relating to problems of general interest, in all the activities of the Organization, and in securing a more judicious representation of all States in United Nations bodies. This approach, we are convinced, is fully in accord with the spirit and objectives of the United Nations Charter.\n46.\tThe delegation of Romania is convinced that consideration in plenary meetings of the item proposed by our country will provide an opportunity for a full debate on the most effective ways and means to strengthen the role of the United Nations in promoting international peace, security and co-operation. With that purpose in mind, the Romanian delegation is willing to work together with other delegations so that by joint efforts we may reach specific conclusions and suggest concrete measures apt to promote the achievement of the above-mentioned goals.\n47.\tThe Government of Romania, as is well known, attaches particular importance to the problem of strengthening international security. As we see it, consideration of this item at the present session should give new impetus to the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] in all its provisions and, at the same time, should lead to the consideration and adoption of new measures capable of securing the elaboration of a common code of behavior to guide the members of the international community.\n48.\tBearing in mind the specific mutations and phenomena of our time and the most pressing requirements of international life that make indispensable the strengthening of international legality, Romania' believes that it is an imperative necessity to reach an agreement of a universal nature to consecrate the higher commandments of conduct and actions in inter-State relations, as well as the fundamental rights and duties of States. In our opinion, such a code should firmly proclaim the need to respect the sacred right of each nation to free existence, to sovereignty and independence, to peace and security; should reaffirm the obligation of all States to respect the right of each nation freely to decide its own destiny according to its interests and without any outside interference; should recognize the right of all States to self-defense by all means, including military means, against any attempt to violate their sovereignty and national independence; should recognize and establish the principle that no problem of interest to different States can be settled without the direct participation of and respect for the interests of all parties concerned; and should proclaim that any violation of the principles which should govern international relations and any interference in the affairs of other States would be regarded as acts contrary to peace and as offenses against the cause of international co-operation. All countries must solemnly reaffirm their obligation not to resort to the use or threat of force against another State. The Powers possessing nuclear weapons should undertake a commitment not to use or threaten to use those weapons against any State or in any circumstances.\n49.\tAt this session we are pleased to note an evolution towards detente that is asserting itself in an ever more manifest manner throughout the world. We are witnessing a process of a vast increase, on all continents, of international contacts, meetings and negotiations, in which States that for a long time had no dialog whatsoever are also participating. Thus we come to the conclusion that mankind is more and more aware of the fact that the only way to settle disputes is to negotiate with a view to reaching political solutions to all problems, no matter how difficult they might be.\n50.\tDespite this positive development, it would be dangerous to be misled by the illusion that the problems facing mankind today have been or are on the way to being finally settled. We cannot afford to ignore or underestimate the gravity and the degree of harmfulness of certain military conflicts and hotbeds of tension that still persist in the world.\n51.\tThe Romanian Government resolutely demands that the flames of war in IndoChina be extinguished, that United States intervention against the heroic VietNamese people cease, that the bombings and other military actions stop and that United States troops be totally withdrawn, so as to enable this people, as well as the Cambodian and Laotian peoples, freely to solve their problems without any outside interference.\n52.\tWe support the declaration of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972, a document also widely supported by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, which represents a new, constructive initiative aimed at the political settlement of the VietNamese problem within the framework of the Paris talks. We likewise support the initiatives of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and those of the Patriotic Front of Laos.\n53.\tWhile expressing its deep concern regarding the persistence of the state of tension in the Middle East, Romania favors a political solution of that conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), requiring the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories and assuring the integrity and sovereignty of every State in the area. At the same time, we consider we must act so as to find a solution to the problem of the Palestinian population in accordance with its legitimate interests and ensure appropriate conditions for its independent development.\n54.\tThe Romanian Government reasserts its position that no State has the right to raise territorial claims over other States under the pretext that this corresponds to its own needs of security and sovereignty. The security and sovereignty of a State cannot be ensured by territorial conquests but solely through a policy of friendship and peace with all neighboring States.\n55.\tRomania highly appreciates the political initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which makes it possible to reach agreements that open up the road to normalization of relations between North and South Korea, to their peaceful and democratic reunification without any outside interference and to a unitary development of the Korean nation. Our Organization must also reach appropriate conclusions and act in support of this process.\n56.\tIn keeping with the fundamental interests of all peoples, Romania attaches particular attention to the achievement of general disarmament and in the first place of nuclear disarmament.\n57.\tIn view of the seriousness of this problem we are bound to state that, unfortunately, the negotiations that have been going on in Geneva for years have not produced results on a level with expectations. Without underestimating the significance of certain agreements on partial or collateral problems, we consider that too little has been achieved as far as the implementation of real measures of disarmament is concerned.\n58.\tThe Romanian Government is of the opinion that we must resolutely strive towards effective actions with a view to stopping the arms race, freezing and gradually reducing military budgets, establishing a concrete program to ban the use of thermonuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, halting the production, and liquidating the stockpiles, of such arms, adopting effective measures to dismantle foreign military bases and to secure the withdrawal of troops from the territories of other States. Furthermore, we must take these practical steps leading to a gradual reduction of national armed forces and the abolition of military blocs.\n59.\tRomania has constantly urged the convening of a world disarmament conference and is resolutely working for this. We conceive of such a conference as a high governmental forum with general competence in the field of disarmament for debates and negotiations on the basis of universal participation. The Romanian Government considers that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly at its present session to adopt a decision on the convening of the conference under the auspices of the United Nations and that preliminary organizational provisions should be adopted so as to pave the way for practical preparations and for convening the conference at the earliest possible time.\n60.\tIn addition, the Romanian Government believes that the entire activity of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should be improved and expanded, made democratic and submitted to effective control on the part of world public opinion.\n61.\tThe evolution of political life in Europe has brought to light in the last few years the possibility of establishing new relations among the States of that continent and of achieving European security. As a European country, Romania has made its contribution to the improvement of the political climate on the continent, and has supported the positive steps taken towards recognition and respect for the realities in Europe and towards complete normalization and multilateral development of inter-European relations.\n62.\tThese positive trends should be continued and extended by establishing normal relations, in accordance with international law, with the two German States, as well as between the two German States themselves, and by admitting the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as Members with equal rights to the United Nations and other international bodies.\n63.\tIt is the view of the Romanian Government that European security requires the setting up of a system of clear obligations on the part of all States, and the adoption of concrete measures aimed at ruling out any act of the use or threat of force, pressure or constraint in relations among States in Europe. Such a system should guarantee the free and independent development of all countries, in accordance with the will of their peoples, as well as wide co-operation devoid of any barriers, on the basis of the principles of international law.\n64.\tIt is with those aims in mind that adequate preparations should be made for a conference on co-operation\\\" and security in Europe, to be convened as early as possible. That conference must be a democratic forum for all interested States to discuss and must adopt measures aimed at setting up new relations on the European continent, establishing appropriate conditions to overcome the present division into opposing military blocs, and creating a climate of understanding, good neighborliness and co-operation in every field of political, economic and social life.\n65.\tIt is in that context that efforts have been made towards closer co-operation among the Balkan States. Romania, which since 1957 has submitted proposals to this end, considers that it would be useful to prepare a meeting of representatives of the Balkan countries to discuss the question of transforming the Balkans into a zone of peace, co-operation and good neighborliness, and to reach agreement on the principles of economic, political, scientific and cultural co-operation among the Balkan countries.\n66.\tThe establishment of a European security system, as well as the conclusion of agreements on a subregional level, would open the way to the establishment of new relations on the continent. It is our belief that such relations would constitute a significant contribution to the general cause of strengthening peace and security in the world, and would have a considerable and particularly favorable effect on international life as a whole.\n67.\tThe Romanian people follows with feelings of deep solidarity the just struggle of the peoples of Africa and other continents for the preservation of their national entity and the abolition of the vestiges of colonial domination.\n68.\tThe resolute and consistent way in which Romania has always sided with peoples fighting for their liberation or concentrating their efforts on achieving political and economic independence enjoyed significant recognition in the warm and enthusiastic welcome given to the President of the State Council of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, on the occasion of the visit he paid this year to eight African States. That welcome eloquently demonstrated the feelings of friendship, esteem and solidarity binding the Romanian people and the peoples of the great African continent. That visit enabled the Romanian messengers to see for themselves the magnitude of the energy resources and creative capacity of those peoples, and the influx of fresh and constructive forces they can bring to the community of nations.\n69.\tRomania grants active political, diplomatic and material support to the national liberation movements of the peoples of Guinea (Bissau), Angola, Mozambique, Namibia and other Territories, and to the anti-colonialist struggle of peoples to conquer and consolidate their independence as States. We consider that new actions should resolutely be taken in order fully to implement the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. To that end, international recognition of the national liberation movements and the drawing up of concrete programs by the United Nations and its specialized agencies so as to give those movements material support would be of particular significance. It is also necessary for the United Nations to condemn in no uncertain terms the repression by the colonial Powers of the national liberation movements and to draw up practical measures for the prompt cessation of colonial domination and the proclamation of the independence of oppressed peoples.\n70.\tWe resolutely condemn the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination practiced by the racist minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. We are in favor of the adoption of effective measures aimed at eliminating all forms of propagation of racism, prohibiting the instigation of hatred and discord among peoples, and banning propaganda against peace and humanity.\n71.\tUnderdevelopment represents one of the most important and grave problems bf contemporary society, one on whose solution the peace, progress and prosperity of the entire world depend.\n72.\tThe problem of eliminating the wide gap between the industrialized and the developing countries has at present acquired a world-wide dimension. For many long years we have been witnessing the tragic situation of a world where underdevelopment continues to worsen while vast material resources are wasted for military ends.\n73.\tThe international community, the United Nations and its specialized agencies are called upon to undertake action and to carry out programs to support more energetically the efforts of developing countries in order to ensure maximum development of their natural and human resources.\n74.\tThe multiplication of international economic relations and the development of exchanges of material and spiritual values among all States of the world in a spirit of equity and irrespective of their level of development or their social-political systems respond to an objective necessity of the contemporary age and constitute a fundamental prerequisite for universal progress.\n75.\tBearing in mind these realities, Romania, in view of the fact that it is itself a developing socialist country, consistently declares itself in favor of the intensification of international co-operation, which can accelerate the economic and social progress of all countries and, in the first place, of the countries which strive to liquidate the heavy heritage of the past. My country gives it support to all constructive actions undertaken within the framework of the United Nations and to the recommendations of UNCTAD.\n76.\tMy country, on whose initiative the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples was adopted in 1965 [resolution 2037(XX)], continues to believe that a major concern of the international community should be an in-depth consideration of the complex problems of the young generations and the establishment of the necessary structures in order that youth may take an effective part in the economic and social development of peoples and have the possibility to express its opinions on all the essential questions of contemporary life.\n77.\tThese are the guiding principles and the fundamental options of socialist Romania in foreign affairs. It is in this spirit that Romania will ceaselessly work in order that the United Nations may make an increasingly active and effective contribution to the common endeavors of peoples to build a world where all nations, free and equal in rights, will be able to fulfill their legitimate aspirations to peace, well-being and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my President, and therefore of the Government and the people of Malawi, I wish to associate myself with the warm tributes and sincere congratulations addressed to you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. From what we know of you, from what we have seen of your ability and from what we have witnessed of your exemplary performance in directing and supervising the debates and the discussions that have taken place so far, I can say with honesty that we could not have chosen a better President for this session than yourself. Naturally we are happy and delighted that a candidate whom we supported succeeded in being elected. The Malawi delegation will therefore continue to render every assistance and to co-operate with you in the very important task that lies before you.\n240.\tI should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, who has finished his term of office and returned to concentrate his many talents on the affairs of his great country, Indonesia. My delegation watched with appreciation and admiration the high standard of direction of last year's session, when Mr. Malik was its President. Once again I wish to pay our most sincere tribute to him for a good job very well done.\n241.\tMay I also take this opportunity to pay a further tribute to the former Secretary-General, U Thant, for his modesty, integrity and unassuming character which, among other things, greatly contributed to making him an ideal international civil servant. His devotion to duty and his relentless search for solutions to puzzling problems deserve our unreserved praise. Although he is no longer with us, I can assure him that we wish him continued health and much happiness in the years that follow his well-earned rest and retirement.\n242.\tTo the new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, we extend our heartfelt appreciation for his performance which, so far, has revealed that his ability and experience as a former diplomat and Foreign Minister of a medium-sized neutral country is, indeed, an added asset to his credentials. He can count on our co-operation and support in the discharge of his duties, as his country did when he was being considered for election.\n243.\tWe are meeting here in the Assembly to try and find solutions to the many problems facing the world today.\nThe very fact that we are meeting and airing our views contributes very considerably to reaching a stage where different points of view can be listened to, considered, analyzed and decided upon. Clearly what decisions we arrive at in regard to the many problems we will discuss may represent no more than a consensus of views and ideas from different human beings exposed to different environments, circumstances, philosophies, and so on, all of which are factors influencing their thinking. It is in that context that all that I shall say with regard to the problems we are currently facing should be viewed.\n244.\tMalawi is in southern Africa. It lives with the problems that are inherent in the political climate and situation that prevail in the region. What we are going to say here is not based on what we have heard and read from expatriate scholars or journalists who are regarded by most non-Africans as specialists or experts on African affairs, but on what we have seen and experienced.\n245.\tThe Government of the Republic of Malawi wishes to associate itself with Member States in expressing sincere appreciation for the manner in which the United Nations has continued to address itself to the chronic problems of southern Africa. It is a matter of deep concern to us that, despite those efforts, southern Africa, remains a problem area and, as such, a continual threat to international peace and security. As one of the countries that believe that international peace and security are necessary prerequisites for the economic development and social progress of any nation, Malawi will continue to exert its efforts towards the achievement of peace and the creation of a political climate that is conducive to economic development with its concomitant social progress and the resultant happiness for mankind.\n246.\tWe believe that, basically, the problems of southern Africa have been those of decolonization and racial discrimination. Although our Organization has discussed and debated those problems for the past two decades or so, so far little conspicuous success has been achieved that could directly be attributable to the rhetorical efforts of the United Nations. It was as a result of that realization that we began an earnest search for a possible solution that could be either supplementary or alternative to all previous attempts at resolving the problems in question.\n247.\tMalawi's approach to the question of racial discrimination has not changed. We are as opposed to it as any Member State here present. However, we are convinced that the most effective and positive way to combat such policies is to seek changes in people who hold such attitudes by example, by persuasion and by social contacts, as well as by diplomatic exchanges. It is in an attempt to initiate those changes that Malawi has formulated and consistently followed the policy of contact, dialog and association with the rulers of southern Africa. Indeed, it was in that spirit that my President paid a State visit to the Republic of South Africa in August last year-a visit that was reciprocated in March this year.\n248.\tDuring these visits much was discussed about what diplomats term \\\"matters of mutual interest\\\". What these matters were must be left to diplomatic discretion but suffice it to say that some aspects of them involved discussions of problems between black and white South Africans from all walks of life. We followed this method of approach because we feel that it is more effective to tell Governments about one's thinking concerning their policies through contact and quiet diplomacy than through mere rhetoric from a distance. Indeed, we are happy to say that, since we embarked on our policy of contact at different levels of the political and social strata, the racial situation in South Africa has shown some signs of slow but conspicuous change. This method may be slow in producing appreciable results, but we feel that it is more positive, more effective and more peaceful than are isolation, denunciation and force, which would lead to bitterness and long-lasting hatred among all the parties concerned.\n249.\tOn the future of the Trust Territory of South West Africa, we welcome the major break-through that has been made through the efforts of the Secretary-General in opening up a dialog with the Government of the Republic of South Africa. The fact that South Africa is willing to talk to representatives of the United Nations is in itself a positive development towards finding a solution to the problems of southern Africa. In wishing the Secretary- General's representative every success, we sincerely hope that a just and equitable solution will be found which will lead to the attainment of self-determination under a government acceptable to the majority of the people of that Territory.\n250.\tAs for the Portuguese Territories in Africa, Malawi has continued to have discussions with the Government of Portugal, particularly in regard to Mozambique. We believe that only by talking to Portugal, by persuading the Portuguese Government that its lasting interests lie in a Portuguese commonwealth formed of tree and inter-dependent sovereign States, and by proving that what happened in Brazil can easily be repeated in Africa can a greater impact be made with regard to changing the attitudes and mentality of Lisbon.\n251.\tIt is not without significance that some change of attitude is taking place in Portugal's colonial policy. I know that in some quarters the change has been interpreted as a token gesture to quell criticism. But our Organization would be doing the Government of Portugal an injustice if it did not recognize this change as a political step with great potentialities.\n252.\tBy \\\"changes\\\", I am referring to the recent constitutional legislation which the Government of Portugal has just promulgated in its Organic Law.  It has been learned that, according to these changes, the Portuguese Territories of Angola and Mozambique will no longer be referred to as \\\"provinces\\\" but as \\\"states\\\", which implies organic separation from metropolitan Portugal. In addition, legislatures are said to be in the process of being established in each State, with the membership of the legislatures to be drawn from all races of the local population. It is probably plausible to argue that for the first few years the elections to these legislatures may not meet the basic tenets of the principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\". However, we hope that whatever qualitative standards Portugal may prescribe as a prerequisite for membership in the legislatures will be such that they will be able to be improved to a point where Angola and Mozambique can become cosmopolitan States in the style of Brazil , that people of all races can in those countries genuinely regard those States as their own.\n253.\tOn the question of Rhodesia, it is a matter of great concern that the deadlock still continues. But in reaffirming our conviction that the Rhodesian problem is primarily a British responsibility, we wish to express the hope that the door to negotiation will remain open and that all efforts will be made to induce the two sides to come to the conference table again.\n254.\tThere is no dispute among States Members of this Organization that what is required in the Rhodesian problem is a constitutional arrangement which will prove to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole and which will eventually lead to the attainment of democratic independence. There are those who still register their impatience because force has not been used by Britain against Rhodesia. They insist that only boycott, isolation and force will bring the Smith regime to its knees. In this regard, Malawi's position has.not changed. We are still opposed to the use of force against Rhodesia, both from a practical point of view and from a consideration of simple military logistics. Similarly, economic sanctions are not very effective unless they are comprehensive, mandatory, effectively supervised, and complied with by all States. Indeed, isolation and boycott have only helped to make the Smith regime more intransigent, and the victims of this have been mainly our African brothers.\n255.\tMalawi believes that different tactics should now be used if the Rhodesian crisis is to be solved. We remain convinced that the responsibility of everyone who would like to see an acceptable solution to the Rhodesian crisis is to assist the British Government in every possible way in its search for constitutional changes acceptable to the majority of the Rhodesian people.\n256.\tIf we move from southern Africa and come to the next area to the north of us, we arrive in Uganda, where a lot has happened recently. While we respect the right of the Government of that country to initiate and execute its policies in the way it sees fit, I think most of us are agreed on the fact that the hardship and the distress now being experienced by Ugandan Asians holding British passports must be a matter of concern to humanity at large, in the context of some of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n257.\tI am making this point because during the eight years that we have been privileged to be a Member of this Organization we have heard time and again that, while certain Governments in southern Africa have the right to legislate on matters that concern their countries and territories, the effect of their legislation and the practices arising therefrom are matters of concern to the whole world. Surely, what is unjustifiable in respect of one country must equally be unjustifiable in respect of any other country. If we in Africa are not to be accused of double standards, we must view world problems in an objective perspective and act accordingly. It is for this reason that we in Malawi did not consider it proper to comment on what the Government of Uganda found it necessary to do but, nevertheless, we found it desirable to open the door of our small country to some of the suffering members of humanity, so that the modest resources at our disposal could be utilized by some of those people who we believe, and sincerely believe, were in need of help.\n258.\tWe are also aware that problems that seem localized in nature have in reality great implications for international peace and security. The problems of the Middle East and South-east Asia, and the German question, are such that this Organization cannot afford to disregard them. In the Middle East, we would like to see Security Council resolution 242 (1967) implemented. This is because one of the most important aspects of that resolution is that the parties concerned were asked to establish contacts, under the auspices of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring, in order to achieve a peaceful and accepted settlement. Although these efforts by the Organization have so far not been as successful as originally anticipated, we feel that through contact it will be possible to come up with some acceptable compromise if the parties concerned avail themselves of Mr. Jarring's services. We are not underestimating the seriousness of the problem in the Middle East, but if the States in the area are to live in peace with each other, it is essential that contact and dialog be established between the two groups.\n259.\tWith regard to South-east Asia, Malawi has always maintained that the parties involved should together find ways and means of coming to acceptable answers to the problems that prevail in the area. We are pleased to note that the Paris peace talks on the question of Viet-Nam are still going on and that North and South Korea are slowly establishing contacts aimed at solving their mutual problems. It is our hope that these efforts will not have been made in vain, but that some solutions will be found to the almost chronic problems of the area. We are as anxious to see a solution to these problems as are the parties concerned.\n260.\tThe German question has been with us a long time now. However, this does not mean that the world has lost hope for an answer to the problem. It is gratifying to know that the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin was signed last year and was aimed at lessening the tensions created by a divided Berlin. We feel that this was a landmark agreement that may be a remarkable beginning towards finding answers not only to the question of Berlin and Germany, but also to some of the most pressing questions on the continent of Europe.\n261.\tLast but not least, we appreciate all the efforts being made by some of the major Powers in an attempt to make this world a safe place for mankind. We hail with great enthusiasm the contacts established between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. We welcome the continued dialog between the Soviet Union and the United States. Indeed, we cannot remain indifferent to problems that affect the well-being of humanity.\n262.\tThese problems involve international peace and security. If the United Nations is to devote ample time to the problems of colonialism, discrimination and other conflicts, it should operate within a world that is relatively free from the dangers created by such things as the arms race. This is why my Government regards the question of the arms race and disarmament as one of the most important prerequisites for the maintenance of international peace and security. Thus Malawi has followed the progress of the various conferences and talks on disarmament with great interest.\n263.\tMalawi would like to see progress in respect of bilateral as well as multilateral agreements leading towards complete disarmament. There is, indeed, a great need for more information and publicity regarding the question of disarmament so that Member nations could be kept informed about developments that are taking place. We are aware that, although this Organization and a few other well-intentioned nations are striving hard to reach an agreement over the question of disarmament, there are still obstacles to an acceptable agreement for complete disarmament. Malawi would like to appeal to those concerned to rethink the matter and to align themselves with the wishes of all mankind for the sake of peace and security, which would eventually create a favorable atmosphere for the implementation of measures dealing with the problems of disease, hunger and poverty. We believe in a policy of contact and dialog in order to achieve this end. Malawi believes that a settlement can be achieved not through the show of arms, but through peaceful coexistence for the maintenance of peace and security, the cardinal principles of this Organization.\n264.\tMalawi has also noted with satisfaction the destruction of bacteriological weapons by some Member nations and hopes that many of those which own such dangerous and destructive weapons will do the same. It is hoped that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)] will help to make many nations destroy what they already have and completely stop the manufacture of such weapons.\n265.\tWe welcome the progress made by the United States and the Soviet Union on the bilateral Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for the limitation of the production of certain arms and the destruction of at least some of the stockpiles of such dangerous weapons. We hope that reason will prevail. It is time that mankind began to be convinced of the futility of the existing arms race.\n266.\tI should like to state also that Malawi would like to see the observance by all nations of the .Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. For this Treaty to be fully meaningful, all of its provisions must be fully implemented and the proliferation of nuclear weapons must stop. Greater efforts should be made towards the application of nuclear energy for peaceful uses as well as for the exploration of outer space for the benefit of all mankind.\n267.\tBefore I come to the end of my address, I want to thank the Assembly very much for its patience in listening to my country's views on some of the most pressing problems of our time. On my part, I wish to put on record that my delegation has been enriched by the deliberations and will continue to benefit from the views of representatives gathered here during this session. May the spirit of contact between nations and the communication of ideas practiced here in this Assembly find an echo in the world that we by our joint efforts represent!\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, representing my country once again in the General Assembly of our Organization, it is a pleasant duty for me to express to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This honor done to your personal qualities is also a tribute to the great country you represent for its indefatigable contribution to the cause of peace. And there is no reason to conceal the fact here that Poland itself has recently given evidence of its attachment to peace when its leaders agreed a little more than a year ago to settle peacefully an old frontier quarrel which rendered precarious a true normalization of the situation stemming from the Second World War. The Treaty of Warsaw, concluded and signed on 18 November 1970 between the People's Republic of Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany, 13 can in itself justify the confidence we have in your country, through you, in organizing and conducting the proceedings of this session. With its acute sensitivity to measure and balance, the heritage of a culture drawn from the sources of the Europe of classicism, the people of Poland has always set an example of moderation and justice in its relations with the rest of the world. This people, which was divided more than once in the course of its history, has preserved its unity thanks to its genius and the force of its persevering and enduring nationalism. This nobility and this breadth of soul of your countrymen, together with your personal qualities, which are familiar to us all, allow us to predict that your election to the presidency of this Assembly will inject new life in the Organization, which will truly make of it a center for the search for peace and international security.\n194.\tPermit me now, Mr. President, to pay a particular tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, for his great competence, tact and courtesy in conducting the proceedings of the twenty-sixth session.\n195.\tIt is in the nature of things that any human enterprise from time to time requires an injection of new resources of invention and ingenuity to ensure its normal progress and to improve its results. Our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, about whom you will allow me to say a few words, has already showed that he measures up in more than one respect to the task that faces him. His many trips to Africa, Europe and more recently to Asia have been the occasion for broad diplomatic action whose impact on the international situation will be very important for the future of our Organization. His efforts to improve the financial situation of the Organization cannot be overlooked because they have already yielded appreciable results. We must recognize that in such a short time our Secretary-General has performed some positive tasks in the service of the Organization. For that alone he deserves our warm congratulations and admiration.\n196.\tEverything suggests that Africa will be for a long time to come the sick continent of the century and the most long suffering one or our planet. With the multitude of problems which beset it on all fronts and the procession of misfortunes and frustrations which have afflicted entire generations in this world which is supposed to be so modern and civilized, we are entitled to wonder whether men have not reached a point of resignation where they take a kind of gloomy delight in witnessing the contrasts constituted by liberty and unconcern. The passivity with which some people view the repeated violations of fundamental human rights which manifest themselves in the form of a cruel racial discrimination in southern Africa and the atrocious wars of reconquest in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) calls into question the whole international code of ethics which gave birth to this Organization. But if there are nations which still believe in the validity of the purposes and the objectives of the Charter then the time has come for them to take a stand in choosing between a new awakening for the construction of a better world for everyone and a return to a quite recent past when the right of might prevailed over the might of right. We should like still to hope that the reasons of the heart and of morality will succeed in replacing the cold logic of material interests which the folly of men has tended to place in the position of highest priority.\n197.\tSome striking facts of contemporary political affairs in recent months do justify some hope. The meetings of the Security Council in the African city of Addis Ababa in January and February of this year was the occasion for us to convince the great Powers of the Tightness of our cause and to bring to the attention of world public opinion the fact that our struggle against racial oppression and colonialism perpetrated against a large portion of our continent is a just one. In spite of the reluctance of the administering Power and of some others to associate themselves with the Security Council resolutions on Rhodesia, the conclusions of the Pearce Commission  have made it quite clear that henceforth there is no point in trying to decide the destiny of African peoples without their own participation. This is a lesson which should be pondered, particularly by the South African, Rhodesian and Portuguese Governments.\n198.\tFurthermore, the agreement recently reached with the South African authorities for the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General for Namibia constitutes a step forward, for which we wish to congratulate our Secretary-General. Nevertheless, I should like to make it clear that for us the final goal still remains self-determination and independence for the people of Namibia.\n199.\tThe tragic internal conflict which rent the Sudan for almost 17 years has just been brought to a happy end thanks to the mediation of the African Conference of Churches and His Majesty Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia. This is a great victory for the people of the Sudan and its leaders, who brought about the triumph of tolerance and wisdom in order to make national reconciliation possible. I should like to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General our appreciation for his efforts on behalf of the United Nations to render assistance to the Government of the Sudan and to help it in rehabilitating the people of the southern region of the country.\n200.\tThe state of affairs in the Middle East has remained stagnant since our last session in this same hall, and one might wonder with some concern whether this \\\"no peace, no war\\\" situation will persist for a long time to come. On both sides of the cease-fire line, armed enemies in possession of the most advanced and sophisticated forms of human and material destruction are in a state of confrontation. All the efforts of our Organization to persuade the parties to proceed from declarations of intent to the actual negotiation of a true and lasting peace have not yet met with any success. However, in spite of all the difficulties which still persist in bringing about a peaceful settlement of this conflict, we continue to believe that reason will finally triumph on both sides and that external influences will be brought to bear in the direction of safeguarding peace rather than that of maintaining a precarious order dictated by mere material interests. It is to this end that we very much hope that there will be continuation of negotiations under the aegis of the Secretary-General, and we would request all peace-loving nations to give him their support.\n201.\tOur optimism as to the possibility of bringing about a peaceful situation in the world has just found some justification in the direct contacts which have recently taken place last May between South and North Korea. Thus, on its own initiative, Korea has found its own path towards reunification without foreign intervention thanks to the wisdom and determination of its leaders. We take great pleasure at this happy course of events and hope that all the members of the international community will refrain from adopting any position which might jeopardize what has already been achieved and will endeavor to encourage the two parties to persist in their search for a restoration of peace.\n202.\tAnother date which will go down in the history of international relations is that of 3 July 1972, on which the leaders of India and Pakistan decided to let bygones be bygones and sat down at the negotiation table at Simla. The Indo-Pakistan agreement on bilateral relations based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter was brought about thanks to the wisdom of the heads of the Governments of the two countries, who thus affirmed their faith in the virtues of dialog for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n203.\tThe difficult heritage of the past cannot be swept away at a single stroke. But what counts is the will of all parties to hold themselves ready for the discussion of problems that are often quite acute. This will was clearly expressed by the two Governments, and we want from this rostrum to express to them our admiration and our pleasure, as well as our hope that there will be rapid agreement on the fate of the prisoners of war and displaced persons in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Security Council.\n204.\tOur Organization is now at the crossroads. The entry into the United Nations on 25 October 1971 of the most populous nation on earth is in itself a sign that a new era has begun for the great family we form in this Assembly. If we have welcomed that admission as the prelude to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations, we are entitled today to express our gratification at another event that will inevitably have a beneficial effect on the evolution of international relations. The historic visit of the Chief Executive of the United States to the People's Republic of China at the beginning of this year was for the whole world an illustration of the essential truth that differences in ideology are not incompatible with the search for peace and coexistence. It is for that peace and peaceful coexistence that we should be happy one day to see the Chinese of Peking and the Chinese of Taipei sitting around the same table, animated by the same desire to bring about the normalization of a situation which more than 20 years of history have imposed upon China.\n205.\tStill within the framework of detente and international security, the nine-day visit of the President of the United States to the Soviet Union after a quarter-century of cold war marked a decisive turning-point in the process of detente and disarmament. Indeed, the great success of that visit will be the agreement on the limitation of strategic arms.  Although in practice this agreement constitutes nothing but the freezing of the number of missiles in the nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers, it does permit the hope that discussions with a view to general and complete disarmament will have a favorable outcome.\n206.\tThanks to the sustained efforts of the international community, many agreements have now been reached in the field of the limitation of arms and, indeed, in the field of the prohibition of nuclear tests. We would with the Secretary-General express the hope that those efforts will go on and rapidly bring about the necessary political decision for the final conclusion of an agreement on the total prohibition of nuclear tests.\n207.\tAn opinion often expressed from this rostrum as also in the course of many international conferences is that total disarmament would be the surest guarantee of international peace and security. We should like to reaffirm that, and to make it clear that the allocation of the tremendous resources devoted to the manufacture of military devices to the needs of the third world would be the noblest and most effective form for the international co-operation humanity requires in order to assuage substantially the poverty and tribulations of the \\\"have-nots\\\" in both the developed and the developing countries.\n208.\tIn the economic and social field, all efforts converge towards the search for balance, and all nations are trying to overcome the numerous difficulties they face by incessantly increasing co-operation and assistance.\n209.\tIn spite of all these efforts the United Nations still remains powerless to solve the great problems of development faced by the third world.\n210.\tIn the realm of trade, the efforts of certain industrialized countries to apply an appropriate policy of access to their markets in order to increase the export earnings of the developing countries are certainly substantial. But the process is slow, and the products concerned often represent only a small proportion of total exports, particularly so far as concerns processed products. That is why my country notes with infinite regret the failure of all attempts to find appropriate solutions to the principal problems raised at various international meetings.\n211.\tThus at the third session of UNCTAD, held at Santiago, Chile, with regard to the primary problems, the search for solutions which might have given rise to some hope for the third world came up against the opposition of the rich countries, whose concern to avoid undertaking commitments of a general kind became even clearer than it had been at previous conferences. In fact, everyone preferred to make use in his zone of influence of concessions as instruments of pressure. It is, incidentally, remarkable that in actual practice in the last decade the elements of inequality and domination in relations between rich and poor countries have been intensified. Consequently, the least we can ask of the affluent countries is that they refrain from aggravating a situation that is already extremely alarming. Furthermore, we think it is urgent for general agreement to be reached on the stabilization and improvement of commodity prices.\n212.\tFurthermore, the present monetary situation has aggravated the deterioration in terms of trade and the various readjustments made necessary by the situation have even further increased the indebtedness of the developing countries. Our Organization should without further delay contemplate compensatory measures for the countries of the third world and associate them with all negotiations on reforming the international monetary system in the light of the influence any reform will inevitably have upon the economies of the developing countries.\n213.\tAs far as concerns assistance, the objective of the International Development Strategy is, as we know, that of bringing to at least 6 per cent the average annual rate of growth of the gross national product of developing countries. We are therefore entitled to hope that the new Decade will see a qualitative increase in assistance from the rich to the poor countries. Unfortunately, in this regard it is regrettable that the means advocated by the third world in Santiago have not won the total support of the donor countries.\n214.\tFor its development, the third world fundamentally needs capital, as also technical expertise and the practical abilities necessary to use such expertise. The success of this development requires that the transfer of this capital and technology take place without overwhelming the recipient countries by exorbitant repayment schedules and without placing them in a situation that prevents them from controlling their own economic priorities and their own social structures.\n215.\tIn spite of the great concern aroused by the conduct of the affluent countries in the face of the problems of development confronting the third world, my Government appreciates the resolutions adopted in Santiago in favor of the least advanced countries and hopes that the special measures to be taken will rapidly be made effective in order to reduce the enormous lag of those countries.\n216.\tFrom all the speeches that have been made from this rostrum there emerges the unanimous and constant will of all States to live in peace, to rid themselves of the threats facing humanity, and to ensure coming generations of a better future, a future of greater justice and dignity. We are convinced that the United Nations can and must be the instrument of our actions if we want to meet those aspirations. We issue an urgent appeal to countries large and small to strengthen the means available to our Organization With a view to permitting it rapidly to triumph over its difficulties and meet the hopes reposed in it by all the peoples. Let us join our efforts to make of the United Nations a real, effective source of solutions to conflicts and of the improvement of the standards of living of hundreds of millions of human beings who still live in need and poverty, because the objectives of peace must be based, to quote Seneca, \\\"on a common mode of existence, on a way of living for others, if we really want to live for ourselves\\\".\n217.\tLet us together, then, solemnly undertake to translate into fact those wise words of Seneca so that the Second United Nations Development Decade can be the decade of peace and a better future for everyone.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is particularly pleasant for me to express to you on behalf of my delegation om- warmest congratulations on your outstanding election to preside over the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your abilities and the experience that you have acquired in the course of a long career entirely devoted to the service of your country made you a natural choice to play the eminent role the General Assembly has entrusted to you. Thanks to your well-known ability and competence, we are sure you will preside over our debates wisely and effectively and thus ensure the final success of our work.\n2.\tIn a world that is more and more shaken by violence, our Organization more than ever has the imperative duty to find and propose to the community of men the ways and means that will lead to detente and peaceful coexistence. That is why, Mr. President, your role is one of vital importance, for from the results of our work will be born either hope and light or doubt, pessimism and fear. This shows that your task, although noble, is very difficult because of the complexity and gravity of the problems we have to confront. We have no doubt that you will be successful in carrying out this exceptional task with your enlightened judgment and your realism and with the assistance and full co-operation of all the Members of this Assembly.\n3.\tMy delegation is also gratified to be able to pay a sincere tribute to the outgoing President of the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Adam Malik, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia. Our last session registered important successes, thanks to the work of Mr. Malik, who showed great patience, a spirit of co-operation and effectiveness.\n4.\tI shall only mention, among the most significant events of the twenty-sixth session, the following: the admission of new Member States, the entry of the People's Republic of China into our world Organization and the election of a new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who succeeded U Thant.\n5.\tThe Government of Gabon would like to address to our former Secretary-General, U Thant, a very special tribute for the invaluable work he did at the head of our Organization during a period of 10 years. Because of his total devotion to the cause of peace in the world, U Thant has earned the thanks of our Organization.\n6.\tTo our new Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, we would again express our hopes for full success in leading our Organization. His talent, his authority and the diplomatic ability he has constantly shown in the course of the first year of his mandate are an earnest of success for the future.\n7.\tA few months have elapsed since the holding of two very important international meetings: the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], held at Santiago, Chile, from 11 April to 19 May 1972 and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972.\n8.\tIn Santiago the representatives of the third world once again denounced the increasing gap between the wealthy and the poor nations and again appealed to the industrialized countries to try to reverse that dangerous trend which is so perilous for the future of mankind.\n9.\tIn Stockholm the representatives of the developed countries expressed alarm at the great danger to nature and to the human species from modifications of the ecological balance caused by the frantic and uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources to satisfy ever-increasing needs.\n10.\tOn the one hand are the poor nations suffering from poverty and hunger, and on the other hand are the wealthy nations complaining about the damage caused by the excessive exploitation of natural resources.\n11.\tAs can be seen, the concerns of one group are not necessarily the same as those of the other, and the exchange of views between the wealthy and the poor nations might well be a dialog of the deaf.\n12.\tIn Santiago recently the third session of UNCTAD pronounced the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade, on which so many hopes had been based.\n13.\tThe transfer by the industrialized countries of 1 per cent of their gross national product to the development of the third world has never been achieved. Indeed, assistance for development has decreased both in volume and in real purchasing power, in view of the depreciation of the value \nof money. The prices of raw materials, produced basically by the developing countries, are becoming lower and lower, whereas the prices of the manufactured goods exported by the wealthy countries are attaining a record level. This system of trade relations can only benefit the industrial nations, which can become even richer by it.\n14.\tThe Second United Nations Development Decade that was solemnly proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 2626 (XXV) was supposed to follow up the first, and was expected to achieve, if not exceed, the objectives that had been set in order to intensify and improve trade relations so as to provide the third world with resources with which to confront the problems of development. But if attitudes do not change and if morality is not introduced in relations of all kinds between the wealthy and the poor countries, then the Second Decade will end as did the first in bitter and inevitable failure. Such a change of attitude and approach was not manifested in Santiago. The two camps confronted one another: the third world, with its miseries and sufferings, calling for justice and understanding; and the industrial countries, unwilling or unready to accept the idea of a more equitable distribution of the profits derived from trade. This attitude of the wealthy countries can only give rise to doubts and skepticism regarding their willingness to help the developing nations by placing greater resources at their disposal, resources of both a financial and a technological nature.\n15.\tThe fact is that the industrial countries are devoting their wealth and their energies to the arms race, which, whatever may be said, has never been so intense or feverish. The Stockholm Conference warned of the grave risks that nature and mankind are running, as the constant utilization in different regions of the world of weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons has effects which are as pernicious and dangerous as those of atomic weapons. My Government must most vehemently denounce the use of force entailed in the arms race and the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations must devote itself, first and foremost, to putting an end to that dangerous situation and impose general and controlled disarmament on the world. But this disarmament must not only be limited to nuclear weapons. It must also cover chemical weapons, since the use of these latter must immediately be condemned and prohibited in those regions where armed conflicts are at present going on.\n16.\tThe limitation of armaments will not only permit the saving of important resources that might then be devoted to development and to the welfare of peoples, but also will make possible a true relaxation of tension in the relations between opposing blocs and ideologies. It will allow us to put out the fires of conflict and will permit the dawning of an era of peaceful coexistence in freedom and in the full exercise of the sovereign rights of individuals. It is that freedom, it is these rights, that the peoples of the third world are fighting to achieve, particularly in Africa, which still suffers from colonialism and racial discrimination.\n17.\tIn Angola, in Guinea (Bissau) and in Mozambique, Portugal, defying the decisions of the General Assembly and world public opinion, still persists in maintaining its domination over African territories, against the will of the peoples to which it refuses the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence. Surely the time has come for the Portuguese leaders to recognize the legitimacy of the people's aspirations and honestly and courageously to find the ways and means, with the leaders of the liberation movements, that will allow Guinea (Bissau), Mozambique and Angola to enjoy their right to self-determination and accede to independence.\n18.\tIn Rhodesia, as in Namibia, the situation is no less disturbing since the dignity of the black man is being flouted. In Rhodesia the Zimbabwe people should have their voice heard and should acquire legitimate rights as citizens. As far as Namibia is concerned, once again we have to express the hope that the Government of South Africa will prove its willingness to achieve peace and show its spirit of conciliation by making concrete and constructive proposals that will lead to the full enjoyment of the right of self-determination by the people of Namibia as a whole.\n19.\tThat will to peace, that spirit of conciliation, are more necessary today than ever, in the light of the efforts being made to find equitable solutions to the conflicts that at present exist. The recent attitude adopted by North and South Korea to find a peaceful solution to the problem of the country's reunification constitutes a clear manifestation of a new spirit. Through their Red Cross organizations these two countries together, without intermediaries and without outside pressures, have decided to undertake negotiations, which we trust will lead to an equitable settlement and an honorable end to the conflict that pits one country against the other, and thus extinguish this source of tension.\n20.\tSo, in the case of the Middle East, the Secretary- General, through his Special Representative, should bring about the resumption of conversations. We believe that the best basis for discussion lies still in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). That resolution was unanimously supported in the General Assembly, and the parties concerned in the conflict publicly agreed with the recommendations contained in it. It is only the full and scrupulous implementation of that resolution that can lead to an equitable solution of the question, thus putting an end to another dangerous situation whose persistence may well lead to a general explosion.\n21.\tWhile the third world is involved in a battle without quarter against development, now that mankind is aware of the need to ensure defense of its natural environment, which, if disturbed, might threaten the very survival of mankind, man should not spend his energies and capacities in futile armed struggles which are so anachronistic and obsolete. Man must once and for all outlaw the use of force as the means of solving conflicts between nations. Man must mobilize his genius and his resources to claim a decisive victory over the enemies of the modern world, those enemies that are called hunger, want, pollution, racial discrimination and injustice.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to express to you, Sir, on behalf of the Government of Bahrain, heartfelt congratulations on your election to your high office. I feel confident that you will guide our proceedings in a manner that will enable us to solve the difficult problems that face us at this session.\n2.\tMay I extend my thanks, too, to our outgoing President for his patient and wise conduct of the work of the last session, without which our task today would have been more difficult.\n3.\tI should also like to thank our Secretary-General for the zeal and vigilance he has shown in carrying out his duties during the short time that he has been in office, and for the valuable and informative report he has submitted to us on the work of the Organization [A/8701 and Add].\n4.\tSince Bahrain's admission to the United Nations during the last session, my country has pursued with interest and satisfaction the many useful activities of the Organization and its various organs and bodies in the economic, social, cultural, humanitarian, health and other fields. The advances made by the Organization in harmonizing international co-operation in these various fields through the dispatch of missions, the opening of regional offices or the convening of conferences have facilitated the study of world problems and the communication of technical knowledge and assistance to those who need it most in the developing world. The assistance and succor given to refugees and victims of racial, colonial or military aggression have reflected the awakening conscience of peace- loving nations and their desire to stamp out from world society the evils of racism, opportunism and exploitation.\n5.\tOne of the outstanding achievements of the Organization this year was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment which was held in Stockholm. My Government attaches great importance to the recommendations of that Conference  which, we hope, will gain wide support.\n6.\tThe outcome of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, held at Santiago in April and May 1972, gave rise to disillusionment and disappointment in the ranks of the developing countries, which had hoped that the developed countries would agree to the implementation of convergent measures that would bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. It is a sad fact of international life that millions continue to live below the minimum levels required for decent human existence. The problems of the least developed among the developing countries have become so urgent that they require immediate and effective remedies. Other, advanced, countries must co-operate to make the concept of international development a reality so that the United Nations may fulfill its promise of ensuring a better world for all peoples.\n7.\tThe General Assembly has included in its agenda an item on measures to prevent international terrorism, including a study of the underlying causes of acts of violence, which are rooted in misery, frustration, grievance and despair [item 92]. This is indeed an important item because, in a sense, it reflects the failure of the United Nations to implement its own resolutions and mete out justice for all. In the United Nations there is still a wide gap between words and deeds, between decisions and enforcement measures, between ideals and reality. It behoves the United Nations, while debating this item, to examine its own record and draw a moral from its own shortcomings. It is not my intention to condone terrorism or acts of violence, which are alien to our history, civilization and culture. But while studying the underlying causes, we should avoid applying double standards and we should not allow this item to be used as a means of undermining liberation movements, challenging basic human rights, or exonerating from blame those States which, by their disregard of political and human rights, have driven some people to despair.\nA/PV.2047\n8.\tIsrael, for instance, expelled the people of Palestine from their homeland and seized all their land and worthy belongings. It also occupies the territories of three Arab States and commits periodic attacks on Arab countries, during which atrocities are committed against civilian populations and innocent people. Who should be condemned: the perpetrator of those acts or the victim, who may sometimes react by imitating the methods that have been used against his own people.\n9.\tSome may say that the United Nations lacks the physical power to take enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. It is common knowledge that the Charter envisaged the creation of a world force, and such force would have been established but for the disagreement among the great Powers. But if physical measures are wanting, do we lack other moral and material forces to implement our decisions and ward off any threat to international peace and security? We honestly believe that the United Nations can marshal enough moral and material force to coerce the aggressor and oppressor to return to reason and to abide by the common will of the international community. How can we say that we have done everything we can, when we see in the Middle East that one party namely, Israel has been excessively armed to wage short and aggressive wars against neighboring countries which are Members of the United Nations. It has occupied parts of three Arab countries and replaced the lawful occupants by hastily drawn immigrants from abroad, contrary to the decisions of the United Nations and to the very letter of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter. All appeals to the aggressor to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations calling upon it to vacate land illegally occupied and to restore the lawful rights of the dispossessed Arab people of Palestine and extend to them proper humanitarian treatment have been continuously ignored and rejected.\n10.\tWould I be asking much if I requested us to call upon those Powers that unceasingly supply strategic and offensive weapons to the aggressive forces of Israel to help them fulfill their expansionist policies and kill innocent women and children, among their other victims, to reconsider their policy and desist, for the sake of peace and humanity? Or would it be much to request, further, that the United Nations use all available means, including sanctions, as provided for in the Charter to put pressure upon the aggressor to comply with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and all other resolutions of the United Nations pertaining to the restoration of the rights of the people of Palestine.\n11.\tI think I should ask for your forbearance and indulgence if I happened to have dwelt a little too long on a problem which is of the utmost importance to my country. This does not mean that I am unconcerned with other problems and questions facing us and the world at large. We live on this small planet as one family of nations, and any act of injustice or oppression committed in any part of the world is of concern to us all and should call for our collective action to redress the wrong and suppress the oppressor.\n12.\tBahrain, therefore, condemns all policies of racism, discrimination and apartheid followed by the Government of South Africa and other sectarian and authoritarian regimes, and gives its whole-hearted support to all measures taken to alleviate the sufferings of the victims of such policies and their eventual liberation from their oppression.\n13.\tWe also support all measures taken or to be taken to liberate people who still live under colonial regimes and to assist them to obtain their freedom and exercise their right to self-determination, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\n14.\tIn pursuit of its policy of peace and prosperity for all nations, the State of Bahrain proclaims its support for the disarmament of the Indian Ocean and the creation of a zone of peace in that area with the agreement of the States concerned. Such a step would tend to eliminate the dangers of war and strengthen world peace and security. We call for similar measures to be extended to all other seas and gulfs where littoral States and lands would be within the reach of destructive naval and aerial forces.\n15.\tIn the field of the human environment, my country, as I have already mentioned, participated in the Stockholm Conference, and looked forward to further measures to be taken to develop the study and protection of the human environment, particularly in the interests of smaller countries which lack the technical knowledge and expertise to protect their people and material resources from environmental pollution or contamination.\n16.\tThose are the views of my delegation on some of the problems and questions placed on the agenda of this session. Our stand on other matters and questions before us will be revealed during the coming discussions and proceedings of this session.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I convey to' you my sincerest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of the \\\"current session of the General Assembly. In expressing to you our best wishes for success in the difficult task that has been entrusted to you by the unanimous decision of the Members of the United Nations, I should point out that in the brief period that has elapsed since you assumed the presidency you have already given us ample evidence to confirm the wisdom of your election. Once again my delegation wishes to offer you its fullest co-operation.\n2.\tAs this is the first general debate that has been held since Mr. Kurt Waldheim was appointed Secretary-General of the United Nations and began to discharge his duties, my Government has expressly instructed me to confirm its full confidence and faith in the activities of the new Secretary- General, whose outstanding personal qualities of talent, wisdom, devotion to the cause of peace and justice, and deep-rooted knowledge of the problems of our era and of our Organization are a guarantee that through the years of his term of office he will guide the United Nations successfully to the achievement of the purposes and principles for which it was established.\n3.\tOnce again my delegation comes to the General Assembly to express its wishes, its concerns, its hopes and disappointments. However, as we are well aware that the allocation of work to the various main Committees will permit of a full and detailed discussion of the items on the General Assembly's agenda in those bodies, my delegation will confine itself here today to making only a few comments on some of those items, especially those in connexion with which we should like to make our position abundantly clear.\n4.\tI should be derelict in the discharge of a fundamental duty, however, if I did not precede these comments with at least a brief review of the characteristic features of the current international situation.\n5.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has given us his views on the international situation:\n\\\"Over the past year three main trends two of them encouraging, one discouraging have been apparent on the international scene. The first is the process of detente among the great Powers. The second and discouraging one is the persistence of conflict in several key areas of the world and the failure, both of the Governments concerned and of the international community, to find acceptable solutions to the underlying problems involved. The third trend is the series of efforts by the international community to co-operate in tackling, through the United Nations system, some of the great long-term problems of our planet, such as trade and development, the environment and population.\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. l.]\n6.\tWe are sincerely gratified to observe the relaxation of tensions between the great Powers and the consequent gradual improvement in their relations-all of which has led to an appreciable positive change in conditions. We know full well that for far too long a period of time the winds of the cold war raged all too forcefully, undermining or completely nullifying opportunities for constructive, fruitful common action. The impact of the new situation, which we witness with such satisfaction, is already obvious, even in regions of the earth geographically far removed one from the other, such as Eastern and Western Europe and the Korean peninsula. But the lessening of tensions does not mean that they have disappeared or that they have been completely eliminated, although we trust that a better day is about to dawn.\nA/PV.2062\n7.\tWe must of necessity be cautious in our optimism. Indeed, we have good reason not to let our hopes fly too high. There have been agreements on the limitation of armaments, the importance of which we cannot and should not underestimate, but the possibilities for general and complete disarmament under effective international control the ambitious goal of a decade-are still remote, and the sums spent by a few powerful States on increasingly complicated and costly armaments remain at such a high level compared with the volume of international financial aid provided by the developed countries to the developing nations that they immediately bring to mind the living conditions of most of the earth's population, which has thus far been frustrated in its desire to break down the artificially erected barriers which bar the way to a better life, to higher standards of living and a more equitable distribution of the fruits of its labor.\u2003\n8.\tThe efforts of the parties themselves and those of the international community have still proved unsuccessful in solving the conflicts in various key areas of the world, to which reference has been made by the Secretary-General. I am thinking of the Middle East and of Viet-Nam. In the Middle East, in view of the precarious present situation, a conflagration may erupt again the devastating flames of which not only would engulf the States located in the area but would also spread and intensify. I am thinking of Viet-Nam where a bloody, grim and destructive war is being waged such as we have seldom seen before. I am thinking of colonialism which, although dying out, has not completely disappeared and is still preventing many peoples from exercising their legitimate right to be the masters of their own destiny and to govern themselves. I must point out that the terrible scourge of racial discrimination still persists in some areas of the world.\n9.\tMy delegation has repeatedly stated its position on all these questions and I need not do so again. But I should like once again to express our hopes that in the not too distant future we shall witness the dawn of peace, of prosperity and justice for the States in areas now beset by armed conflicts and for the peoples of areas where the unrestricted implementation of the right of self-determination is not yet at hand.\n10.\tAt the beginning of my statement I said that my delegation, once again, wished to give voice to its hopes and its frustrations. The latter is an apt term by which to describe the tremendous and growing gap between the two parts in which the world of today is divided, viewed from the standpoint of their degree of development, levels of living and sharing of wealth. On more than one occasion we have said that under the prevailing conditions of international trade, with raw material prices at a standstill or declining and the costs of manufactured goods steadily rising, in the words of the Foreign Minister of Paraguay:\n\\\"The breach between over-developed and underdeveloped countries widens all the time and, although political colonialism may have ended, economic colonialism exercised over the agricultural countries will continue unless there is a substantial change in the present conditions of production and export of agricultural commodities.\\\"\n11.\tI should also remind the Assembly, as I have already done on previous occasions, of a known fact which none the less should be repeated because it influences many of the positions we take. My country is not only a member of the large group called the developing countries, but at the same time it is one of those which realizes that in addition to the problems of development without adequate national capacity for financing and without sufficient international financial aid, which are serious enough in themselves, we are also faced with problems which derive from the fact that we are a land-locked, inland country far removed from the sea and from all the benefits which possession of a coastline brings with it. This fact explains our firm determination and our constant fight in all forums and in all organs to obtain endorsement of the principles of an increasingly enlightened international law which, through international justice, compensates for the obvious disadvantages deriving from a land-locked position. To quote only one example among the many that I could mention, we should bear in mind that, in order to export goods which are the source of our income, and to enable them to compete successfully in foreign markets, land-locked States are compelled to reduce further the already low sales prices or somehow to absorb the higher transport and freight costs for goods shipped to the sea ports. Only thus can these goods compete on an equal footing with those from more fortunate countries that have the benefit of a coastline.\n12.\tThese remarks apply not only to questions concerning world trade but they also have an impact on matters included in the scheduled Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the reservation exclusively for peaceful purposes of the sea-bed and the ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, underlying the high seas beyond the limits of present national jurisdiction and the use of their resources in the interests of mankind.\n13.\tI note the fact, which can easily be verified, that since the outset of the consideration of these questions in 1967 on the use of the aforesaid resources, one point has been very much in the forefront of our debates. This is the question of the extent or breadth of the territorial sea and the extent or breadth of the contiguous zone; and this area is increasingly being described as the patrimonial sea. The importance of this issue has been much more obvious in the current general debate, in the course of which very well qualified representatives of the riparian States have referred to the question in depth. I cannot forget that in these statements and with reference to the exploitation of the resources of the contiguous zone of the territorial sea, the speakers have emphasized that these resources should be used exclusively\u2014I repeat, \\\"exclusively\\\" for the benefit of the coastal States.\n14.\tAt the meeting held on 17 April 1971 at San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, during the first regular session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country Professor Raul Sapena Pastor, referred to the question of the breadth of the territorial sea in order to make the following points on behalf of Paraguay:\n\\\"The Republic of Paraguay is an inland land-locked country, and geographical and historical circumstances have deprived it of the extraordinary benefit of having a coastline. Nonetheless, Paraguay has the right to enjoy freedom of the high seas and unlimited navigation and to have access to fisheries, the underlying resources and the airspace over the sea. To the extent that the States with coastlines arbitrarily increase their sovereignty by widening their territorial sea, they are also arbitrarily limiting the rights of the Republic of Paraguay and of all inland or land-locked States.\\\"\nHe went on to say:\n\\\"The breadth of the territorial sea can be fixed not by national precepts, whether they are derived from law or the Constitution, but through the consent of all States, including those that are land-locked and those that have coastlines, a consent expressed in the form of international agreements.\\\"\n15.\tThe foregoing ideas apply equally to the contiguous zone. The sovereignty of nations over what is described as the territorial sea is an unquestioned concept of international law; but there is no generally accepted agreement on its breadth which, depending .upon the coastal State concerned, extends from 3 to 200 miles. While there may have been a time when the individual will of each riparian State could be exercised in establishing V breadth of its territorial sea, we cannot today condone u system which produces a variety of views derived from unilateral decisions or proclamations. With respect to the breadth of the so-called patrimonial sea, the existence of different criteria is even less warranted.\n16.\tNone the less, we have been asked more than once to support the aspirations of States which wish to extend considerably their territorial as well as their so-called patrimonial sea, or the zone contiguous to the territorial sea. But we have already said that any extension of this kind automatically reduces the rights of the land-locked States. Therefore, there is an obvious contradiction in such requests, when they are made with no mention of any form of compensation. Certainly today's world is growing ever more interdependent; and certainly States-particularly those that belong to the developing world-need each other and are in duty bound to express mutual solidarity to each other in order to strengthen the defence of their common interests. But solidarity implies a certain amount of give and take. It cannot take the form of support by some States for the aspirations of others without corresponding concessions. Yet this is precisely the kind of one-sided situation which exists between the riparian States and the land-locked or inland States. Has the time not yet come, we wonder, to focus on these problems with a more decisive and enlightened sense of solidarity? This is the question that we are not called upon to answer alone.\n17.\tTurning to another group of matters, I would touch on the fact that the General Assembly is preparing to consider actions that might be taken as a result of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Among the decisions which sooner or later will have to be taken are the recommendations for the establishment of an administering board, a secretariat, a fund and co-ordination procedures for programs dealing with the environment, within the framework of the United Nations. In addition, the Conference adopted the text of a declaration, on its Principle 20, which was to refer this to the General Assembly for consideration, together with the proposed amendments submitted in the course of the Stockholm Conference.\n18.\tOwing to the fact that for various reasons my country was not represented at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, I feel it necessary to explain our position on Principle 20, which was the subject of many amendments. We are particularly interested in this Principle inasmuch as it affects international rivers.\n19.\tOur position is defined in the text of the Declaration of Asuncion on the exploitation of international rivers, registered as resolution No. 25 of the Fourth Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Plata basin, adopted on 3 June 1971 in the capital of Paraguay. As this Declaration has already been quoted in this general debate, I think it my duty to quote verbatim the substantive section of that document:\n\\\"The Foreign Ministers consider it to be of real interest to record the fundamental points on which agreement has already been reached and which represent the basis on which study of this item should continue:\ncl. In contiguous international rivers, since sovereignty is shared, any exploitation of these waters should be preceded by a bilateral agreement between the riparian States.\n\\\"2. In international rivers which flow into each other, since sovereignty is not shared, each State can exploit the waters in terms of its needs, always provided that it does not cause any considerable damage to any other State of the Plata basin.\n\\\"3. With respect to the exchange of hydrological and meteorological data:\n\\\"(a) Those already provided will be the subject of dissemination and systematic publication through documents and pamphlets;\n\\\"(b) Data to be processed, either simple observations and readings or graphic registers of instruments, will be conveyed or submitted in accordance with the judgment of the parties concerned.\n\\\"4. States shall in so far as possible attempt to exchange gradually the cartographic or hydrographic results of their studies in the Plata basin in order to facilitate the defining of the dynamic system of the basin.\n\\\"5. States will try as far as possible to maintain in the best possible navigation conditions the courses of the rivers under their sovereignty, adopting to this end the necessary means in order that the works will be carried out so as not to be prejudicial to any other current users of the river system.\n\\\"6. States, in carrying out public works designed for any purpose in the rivers of the basin, shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that they do not damage or change in any prejudicial way the conditions for navigation.\n\\\"7. States, in the carrying out of public works in the river system involving navigation, will adopt any measures necessary to preserve the living resources of the basin.\\\" \n20. My country considers that this Declaration implies very clearly inter alia the lack of entitlement of any State in the basin to divert the waters from one geographic region to another basin or sub-basin.\n21. I should like now to refer to agenda item 89 entitled \\\"Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations: report of the Secretary- General\\\". Two years ago I had an opportunity to state from this rostrum [1855th meeting] that my delegation did not believe that the time was then ripe to take up such a task, but I added that at the same time we considered that the item included in the agenda was an adequate instrument for proceeding to a real and effective evaluation of the predominant thinking among the Members of the United Nations concerning any possible review of the Charter. In the time that has elapsed since then a considerable number of States have been able to make known their views on the possible revision of the fundamental document of the United Nations. Some have done so through notes in answer to the questionnaire submitted by the Secretary- General. Others have done so in the course of statements made by their representatives at this session. We believe that the ideas suggested deserve most careful consideration. I am thinking in particular of the suggestions and proposals which refer to the composition and structure of the Security Council, and among these I should like to mention as an interesting example that which was put forward by the Foreign Minister of Mexico in the statement he made at the 2050th meeting of the General Assembly on 3 October last, to the effect that at least one permanent member of the Security Council should be a representative of the third world and should be on the same footing as the present permanent members. Certainly such an idea, as well as many other important ideas, has aroused understandable interest on the part of my delegation, and we shall examine these ideas, attributing to them all due importance.\n22. I have reserved the last part of my statement for my comments on that scourge which has considerably worsened in recent times, and I refer to international terrorism. This terrorism, which with painful frequency makes victims of the innocent and is characterized by cruelty and absolute contempt for legal rules established to maintain harmony and for the common good, creates a general climate of insecurity and collective fear, breaking down faith in the effectiveness of law and order, and may even lead to a crisis in the rule of law.\n23. Without ignoring the fact that in certain cases terrorism may be a reflection of underlying situations whose correction is essential and urgent, my country does not hesitate to condemn acts of international terrorism and considers that the time has come to proceed to joint action to eliminate this evil. First of all, we believe that every State should adopt measures, in the full exercise of its sovereignty, to prevent and punish this type of crime. Secondly, States, acting jointly, should seek ways and means to make certain co-ordinated and effective action to remove international terrorism from the face of the earth. For this action, for this search, there is no forum more suitable than the United Nations. On the basis of this conviction, we have been gratified to note the initiative taken by the Secretary-General in requesting the inclusion of this item in our agenda, and therefore we have supported this idea both in the General Committee and in the plenary General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Thailand, I should like to extend to you our congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your dynamism, your experience in the negotiating field and your perseverance are among the qualities that will ensure the effectiveness of the present session. You indeed represent the finest attributes of the great Polish nation.\n35.\tMy delegation also wishes to pay a tribute to Dr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, the immediate past President, whose devoted services to the General Assembly have contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of the twenty-sixth session.\n36.\tThe past 12 months have been replete with politically significant events in many areas of the world. Fortunately for the international community, these events and measures all have one aim that is, the reduction of world tensions. As the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is being convened, we may perhaps allow ourselves a little feeling of euphoria that prospects for international peace and security have been enhanced by last year's series of contacts, talks, agreements and treaties, both bilateral and multilateral. Whether or not this development will lead to the attainment of a durable peace is still a matter of conjecture.\n37.\tThe starting point for this eventful year a year of detente was no doubt the entry into the United Nations of the People's Republic of China during the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Since then, the People's Republic of China has been represented increasingly in United Nations organs and bodies. Its participation in all these meetings and more is yet to come has certainly added a new dimension to the discussions and deliberations on the complex issues facing the world. It is our belief that its involvement in international affairs has had and we are confident it will continue to have a salutary effect on the councils of the world.\n38.\tOne such beneficial effect was to move the world off dead center and to provide a momentum for further dialogs among those who had been in deadlock for too long a time on some bilateral and multilateral problems. Thus the new and positive relationship of the great Powers has slowly emerged.\n39.\tThe meeting of the leaders of the most powerful nation on earth, the United States of America, and the most populous nation, the People's Republic of China, helped to set the scene for other meetings of similar purpose. Relaxation of tension, bilateral or otherwise, seems to be the agenda of the day. While the concrete results of the conversations in Peking might have been limited and there was naturally no meeting of minds on the complex issues of war and peace, the fact that the meeting took place at all, and in a friendly and business-like atmosphere, was in itself a triumph of international understanding.\n40.\tPresident Nixon's journey to Peking was followed closely by-another historic visit to Moscow. Here again, the leaders of the two mightiest Powers showed great statesmanship and a determination to create a more stable world. A string of agreements reached between the Soviet Union and the United States, affecting their respective security and economic interests as well as international peace and stability, could not but augur well for the future.\n41.\tElsewhere in Europe, additional steps, particularly a Treaty on Questions of Surface Transport, relating to Berlin, entered into by the divided States of Germany on 26 May 1972, to strengthen the fabric of peace in that continent, are also to be commended. Such measures gave an impetus to a trend which brought about an important agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland. It is our hope that this step-by-step process will generate sufficient confidence in the minds of European leaders and will eventually pave the way for the convening of a conference on European security.\n42.\tIn Asia, rays of hope have also appeared on the horizon. The tragic situation in the former East Pakistan, during which millions of people endured suffering and hardship, led to an armed conflict between India and Pakistan and resulted in the emergence of a new nation, the People's Republic of Bangladesh. While the birth of that nation took place in unhappy circumstances and the birth pains may be slow to heal, the existence of Bangladesh with its 75 million people, recognized by many nations, including Thailand, cannot be simply brushed aside. My delegation sincerely believes that in due course the statehood of Bangladesh will have to be given due recognition by the international community as a whole.\n43.\tThe war on the Indian subcontinent has left a bitter legacy to the people of the three countries. Yet there are increasing signs that the responsible leaders of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have not lost sight of the realities of the situation and the advantages of eventual peaceful coexistence and co-operation in the region. Real problems, such as that of prisoners of war, still exist and will not be solved overnight, but, given the goodwill and understanding evidenced by the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1962, we are hopeful that they will be able, with renewed vigor and imagination, to overcome the obstacles and open a new era of peace and harmony in south Asia.\n44.\tIndeed such vigor and imagination have already been detected in another part of Asia. The visit of the Prime Minister of Japan to Peking last week has helped to ease the strained relationship between the two countries which has existed for several decades. We hope that a new beginning has been made and the antagonism of long standing has now given way to better understanding and co-operation.\n45.\tThe recent opening of serious dialog in the Korean peninsula is to be welcomed by all peace-loving peoples of the world. The initiatives taken by the Red Cross societies of North and South Korea to discuss and arrive at a solution to the problem of divided families have won admiration from all quarters. It is the hope of the Thai delegation that the talks will be successfully concluded and their success will give an impetus to a future dialog on the questions of peace and security in the area and peaceful reunification of the divided country.\n46.\tIn this connexion, my delegation believes that the talks between North and South Korea should proceed in a tranquil and constructive climate, uninterrupted by outside interference and not sidetracked by discussions in other forums. It took the two sides more than 20 years to have direct conversations, and both should be given every encouragement and support, so that they may continue to rely on their own efforts to reach a political settlement. Any move in the United Nations, however well-intentioned, may have the unfortunate effect of disrupting the current talks or jeopardizing the prospects of a successful outcome of the meetings. It was, therefore, gratifying to my delegation that by a clear-cut majority the General Assembly decided, at its 2036th meeting, to defer consideration of the question of Korea to the next session.\n47.\tThere are, however, two other areas in Asia where the chances of attaining peace are still remote. The Middle East situation continues to be a source of grave concern. Troops in occupied areas have not been withdrawn. The Jarring mission appears to be at a standstill and to be in no position to break the deadlock which has existed for quite some time. It is, however, our hope that Ambassador Jarring will continue to pursue his efforts to bring the contending parties to a negotiating forum, taking full account of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The recent military activities on the ground have broken the precarious cease-fire which had been in effect for some time. The operations have, unfortunately, added another link to the chain of violence and reprisals, and the task of achieving peace with justice and security has been made more difficult.\n48.\tThe situation in South-East Asia also remains one which is fraught with danger. The invasion of South Viet-Nam by North VietNamese regular forces through the demilitarized zone last May has brought untold suffering to the people of South Viet-Nam. While the onslaught met with failure, the military operations had the effect of prolonging and enlarging the war, thus lessening the chances for a political settlement.\n49.\tLaos and the Khmer Republic continue to be subjected to interference by outside Powers, and the presence and military activities of the North VietNamese regular troops against the legally constituted Governments of the countries are in violation of the United Nations Charter and relevant international agreements.\n50.\tWe in Thailand also have suffered from the terrorist and subversive activities which are supported, financed and directed by sources outside the country. It is, however, our earnest hope that those foreign sources will begin to see the wisdom and practicability of peaceful coexistence and co-operation on the basis of the principles enunciated at the African-Asian Conference, held at Bandung in 1955. Under such circumstances will the peoples of South-East Asia have a real opportunity to attain their common goal of turning that region into a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers. This objective embodies our long-term interest as perceived by the Governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and enunciated in the Declaration of the Association of South-East Asia Nations [ASEAN] of 27 November 1971. It also represents our determination to bring about a relaxation of international tension and our desire to achieve a lasting peace in South-East Asia.\n51.\tIt goes without saying that, while wars continue to rage in the region, it is difficult to realize such a regional objective. On that basis, the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN at their last meeting in July agreed on a set of proposals and requested the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Dr. Adam Malik, to ascertain the reaction of the parties concerned.\nThe results have not been forthcoming as we would have wished, but the efforts will be pursued relentlessly.\n52.\tThe magnitude of the internal and external problems of economic development has already been stressed by previous speakers. The widening gap between the rich and the poor countries has been mentioned time and again in this as well as in other forums. However, when it is recalled that the basic issues involved are so complex and vital to human welfare and progress, one realizes that repetition is unavoidable and even necessary.\n53.\tThe deterioration in the terms of trade of the developing countries continues to be aggravated by fluctuations in the prices of their basic exports and by inflationary pressures in some industrially advanced countries.\n54.\tFurther international efforts are needed also in improving access to markets for certain primary commodities. However, it is heartening to note that some industrialized countries have opened their doors to certain products from developing nations on an equitable basis. It is hoped that such doors will open even wider for further access to a broader range of products from the latter. After all, trade and not aid should be the primary concern of both developed and developing countries.\n55.\tThese and other problems were discussed at the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago, Chile, early this year. Although the meeting did not fully accomplish what it set out to do, it enabled the developing countries to reach a consensus on the direction in which they should proceed in order to achieve for themselves more equitable treatment and a larger share in the making of important economic decisions affecting their interests. The Conference at that session also provided them with the opportunity to air their legitimate grievances on such matters as shipping conferences, trade barriers that hinder their exports, the inadequate transfer of technology, and foreign control of their natural resources. The real and ultimate problem, however, remains one of translating the resolutions adopted at Santiago into action benefiting mankind. Much work still lies ahead of all of us, and we should all recognize that tangible achievements can only result from self-reliance and international co-operation.\n56.\tThe problems of economic development must be considered and their solutions found in the light of man's aspiration and need to live in a healthy and harmonious environment. My delegation notes with satisfaction the successful outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm and hopes that satisfactory agreement will be reached at the present session of the General Assembly on the various recommendations of the Conference. In the final analysis, the success of this tremendous venture lies in the hands of the Governments of the States Members of the United Nations themselves, for they alone have the political will and the power of decision necessary for the effective implementation of those recommendations.\n57.\tThe problems of economic development and the human environment are linked by a common factor, namely the desire of human beings to live a decent life. It is, therefore, patently clear that, as the world population grows, such problems become increasingly important as well as difficult to solve. It is fitting in this context to acknowledge the significant contributions made by the United Nations system to a better understanding of these related problems and to attempts to find solutions for them.\n58.\tMy delegation derives satisfaction from the progress made in the construction of the permanent headquarters for the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in Bangkok, Thailand. The formal ceremony to mark the laying of the cornerstone is scheduled to be held at the site on United Nations Day this month. The complex of buildings will also provide accommodations and facilities for the other United Nations offices situated in Bangkok.\n59.\tThe delegation of Thailand would like to reiterate its strong condemnation of the policies of apartheid and racial discrimination. It is a matter of grave concern that, despite continued manifestations of outrage by the world at large against such immoral practices, and despite repeated efforts on the part of the United Nations to achieve a just solution, little change can be expected in the near future. If this trend were permitted to continue, the area would undoubtedly become a hotbed of turmoil and conflict. Therefore, persistent endeavors by the international community are essential now to prevent such an event from happening in the future.\n60.\tThe efforts of the world Organization to fulfill the deep yearnings and legitimate aspirations of the peoples of Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and other parts of southern Africa have also failed to yield the desired results. It is indeed deplorable that the international will has been and continues to be frustrated, to the detriment of the people concerned. In regard to Namibia, it is to be hoped that the Secretary-General's laudable initiative on behalf of the international community will bring about a just solution in accordance with the United Nations principle of self-determination and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n61.\tIt has become increasingly apparent that international peace and security demand an early establishment of rules and guidelines governing the preparation and conduct of peace-keeping operations. In this important area where inactivity has lasted for too long a period, a solution has at last been found on the organizational questions affecting the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations. Since peace-keeping constitutes a principal function of the United Nations, the Thai delegation thus joins in appealing to the principal members of the Special Committee to demonstrate the necessary degree of co-operation and a spirit of accommodation and compromise in order to enable the Committee to perform its appointed tasks.\n62.\tThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is beset with a financial crisis which will affect the work of that Agency in alleviating the sufferings of the Palestine refugees, whose continued plight should be the concern of all human beings. In this connexion, the Government of Thailand was recently pleased to add its contribution in kind to the relief of these unfortunate people. We hope that ways and means will soon be found to enable the Agency to continue its humanitarian work with adequate financial support and without further fears of insolvency.\n63.\tOn the question of international terrorism, the Thai delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his initiatives in paving the way for an international discussion of this complex and multi- faceted problem. In deciding to take up the question, which has understandably given rise to differences of opinion, the Organization has focused the attention of the world on this important problem. My delegation is ready to participate in the consideration of the item on international terrorism with an open mind and all due objectivity.\n64.\tThe Thai delegation has consistently shared the widespread feeling of abhorrence at actions which endanger the safety of innocent aircraft passengers and threaten to reduce the benefits of modern air transportation. It wishes to reiterate its conviction that such actions are self-defeating in purpose and must be discouraged at all costs. Thailand is party to relevant international agreements, and it is taking further steps to strengthen its contribution to the international efforts against air piracy.\n65.\tWith the problems confronting the United Nations, my delegation takes comfort in the fact that our Organization has a highly dedicated and skilled diplomat as its Secretary-General. During the short time that has elapsed, his energetic efforts to try to solve the difficult administrative and financial problems of the Organization, which have had some encouraging results, have won our sincere admiration. His courage in facing up to certain other issues has invested his office with an aura of moral strength, and evoked our respect as well as our best hopes for the future of the United Nations. He has thus continued the fine tradition set by his predecessor, UThant, who has left a distinguished record of achievement and a countless number of friends among the members of this Assembly. My delegation's good wishes are extended to both U Thant and the Secretary-General for their continued good health and success.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first of all be allowed to offer my sincere congratulations, and those of the Government and delegation of Malta, on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly? Your election to this high office is not only an honor to your great country, Poland, with which my country is proud to share many ties and common aspirations, but is an eloquent tribute to your own statesmanlike qualities. Those qualities have already been amply demonstrated during the short time you have graced the President's chair, and I am convinced that under your continued wise guidance, and with the co-operation of us all, this twenty-seventh session will prove to be one of the most fruitful in the history of the United Nations. As far as my delegation is concerned, you may count on our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of your onerous duties.\n219.\tI should also like to offer a warm tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General, since this is my first opportunity to address the Assembly following his unanimous election. As we all know, Mr. Waldheim is well fitted, by temperament, experience, dedication and ability, to serve this Organization with the utmost distinction. To him, too, I pledge the fullest co-operation of my delegation in the performance of his duties.\n220.\tEvery year the leaders and spokesmen of the world's nations gather here from the four corners of the world, and for several weeks these halls resound to the most mellifluous oratory, the most persuasive pleas, the most passionate denunciations all directed towards the most pressing problems facing humanity today. Whether these problems affect some or all of us, whether they are old or new, lasting or fleeting, intractable or seemingly easy of solution, they are all important and must be tackled. That is what this Organization is for.\n221.\tSometimes, perhaps, one may be forgiven for wondering whether, after the ritual speeches are over, after the annual crop of resolutions are adopted at the end of the General Assembly's annual session, the' world does not go about its business as if nothing had taken place. This, unfortunately, is an image which has gained ground in recent years and which all of us here, who presumably believe in the United Nations and all that it stands for, must do all we can to combat. But the most effective way to restore the image of the United Nations is also the most difficult: it is, simply, to reach agreement on differences which we have so far been unable to reconcile; it is to place the common interest of mankind before national self-interest; it is voluntarily to surrender some tiny part of that cherished sovereignty which this very Organization is dedicated to uphold. In short, it requires a genuine change of heart, a fresh direction to national wills, and a realization that the world is fast changing. This change is often the result of events which are unplanned, uncoordinated and largely unpredictable in their effects. Such a realization will in turn bring about the inevitable conclusion that the old, time worn responses are no longer adequate and that nationalistic concepts must be reset in an international framework, as befits an intelligent race whose main preoccupation ought to be how to ensure the common survival on this small planet of ours.\n222.\t'And yet, some encouragement can surely be derived from the events of the past 12 months. These events, some of which at any rate have their roots in the activities of the United Nations, may hopefully signal the first faint beginnings of a new world order based on trust and international co-operation.\n223.\tAlmost a year ago, in this very hall, we took the historic decision that brought the People's Republic of China to its rightful seat [1976th meeting]. Events followed swiftly upon each other, with the historic visits of the President of the United States of America, first to China and later to the Soviet Union. Those visits, and the official declarations to which they gave rise, were a clear indication that the world's largest Powers were moving away from the sterile postures of years of confrontation to a new era of genuine coexistence and co-operation. The reverberations of that historic breaking of the ice have not yet died down, and its effects will continue to permeate the atmosphere of international relations in the years to come.\n224.\tAlso during the past 12 months the world has seen the United States and the Soviet Union conclude an agreement on certain measures with respect to the limitation of strategic offensive arms an initial step, soon, we hope, to be followed by more substantial achievements leading towards eventual disarmament. The entry into force of the treaties signed with the Federal Republic of Germany by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and by the Polish People's Republic, together with the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 and the current moves aimed at normalizing relations between the two German States-both of which, I hope, we shall soon be able to welcome to this Organization-have all contributed to a relaxation of tension in Europe. The next move in this context will be the forthcoming preparatory talks soon to be held in Helsinki leading to a full-scale conference on European security and co-operation.\n225.\tWhile we fully support all genuine efforts towards stability and security in Europe, it is our conviction that European security will not be completely achieved unless it is extended to the entire Mediterranean basin and accompanied by economic co-operation with all the countries of the region.\n226.\tIn other parts of the world, we have thankfully seen the end of the bloody fighting on the Indian subcontinent and the emergence of the new nation of Bangladesh. Although conditions in that part of the world have not yet returned to full peace and stability, the necessary foundations have already been laid by the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan, and it is the hope of my delegation that the next few months will see the way clear to the admission of Bangladesh to this Organization.\n227.\tElsewhere in Asia, the continued and growing contacts between North and South Korea afford reasonable grounds for optimism that there, too, the legacy of the cold war has been finally laid aside and the goal of genuine peaceful reunification set up in its stead. It is a matter for regret that, for the second year in succession, this Assembly will not be discussing Korea ^during this session. My delegation had hoped that by joining debate in this forum, the United Nations could have added its positive contribution to the bilateral efforts of the parties directly involved.\n228.\tNo reference to the Far East at this particular time would be complete without mentioning and welcoming the successful visit of the Head of the Japanese Government to Peking. After so many decades of estrangement it is of the utmost significance that the most economically advanced nation in Asia and the most populous nation in the world should have embarked on the path of peaceful co-operation.\n229.\tIf this brief review of positive achievements gives rise to a feeling of optimism, let me say at once that this is overshadowed by the continued persistence of conflict and explosive situations in other areas of the world. In the Middle East, the deadlock which has prevented all efforts for a political solution continues unabated, and the prescription for settlement which is to be found in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) remains unimplemented. My Government reaffirms its conviction that a just and lasting peace in the area can be established only within the framework of that resolution, applied in its entirety; and while we cannot condone the continued occupation of territories by force of arms, we also recognize that each State in the area must have satisfactory guarantees to ensure its independence and territorial integrity. It is indeed sad to have to record that any faint hopes we might have entertained last year have, as a result of recent events, receded into the background. We continue to urge, however, that no effort be spared on the part of all concerned to reactivate the mission of Ambassador Jarring. My country is ready to do all it can, in any way acceptable to the parties to the dispute, in order to promote this objective.\n230.\tIn Indo-China, the horror of a war which has raged for decades continues to devastate the countries of that area. Is it too much to hope that here at least the lessons of the past will be taken to heart and those positive steps taken which alone can lead to a just solution? Lest there be any misunderstanding of Malta's position on this matter, we repeat our call for the cessation of all bombing and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the area so that all the peoples concerned can freely exercise their right to self-determination and, with their industriousness, wisdom and inexhaustible patience, be enabled finally to turn their talents to the immense task of reconstructing their long- suffering countries.\n231.\tI turn now to Africa. It is humiliating for this Assembly to have to acknowledge that, despite all the resolutions which have been passed, despite all the obeisances made to the principles of the Charter, millions of people are still groaning under the yoke of colonialism and apartheid, the progressive forces of the world will not for ever tolerate such an iniquitous situation and, if an explosion is not to occur, the consequences of which will be as devastating as they will be unpredictable, the chains of bondage which have been fashioned by the minority racist regimes and which weigh heavily on the conscience of the whole world must come asunder. We accordingly join our voices with those of others who have appealed from this rostrum for the United Nations to give a renewed lead to the cause of eradicating colonialism in all its manifestations from the world scene.\n232.\tThe solution of the political problems to which I have briefly referred will not of itself bring prosperity to the peoples concerned. Political independence of itself is largely devoid of meaning unless it is accompanied by economic independence. My country, in common with other developing countries, has reason to have learned this lesson well. The efforts of this world Organization must continue to be bent towards the creation of a world order which ensures a fair distribution of wealth. The many programmes of the United Nations family which are geared to tackle, on a multilateral basis, such major economic problems as those which relate to trade and development, international monetary stability, the environment, and the equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed must be pursued with vigour and imagination.\n233.\tTwo events which took place this year merit particular attention. The first was the third session of UNCTAD which was held in Santiago in April and May, the other was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June.\n234.\tIt is regrettable that the meagre results which emerged from UNCTAD's third session disappointed many of the expectations of the developing countries. The attitude of some of the more affluent nations was unfortunately coloured by considerations of self-interest, narrowly conceived. Such an attitude hardly conforms to the objectives of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It is no wonder that the poor and the under-privileged are increasingly pointing to the growing gap between intentions and performance, a gap which is ever widening under the pressure of a fast-growing technology. The third session of UNCTAD did, of course, have its positive achievements, notably in the field of international monetary policy, where agreement was reached to associate the developing countries in the negotiations to take place under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund, as well as in the agreement to accord special assistance to the least developed of the developing countries. On the other hand, no solution emerged to the burning problem of ensuring easy access for the manufactured products of the developing countries to the markets of the developed world and to the question of stabilizing commodity prices. This lack of progress on such fundamental issues cannot but engender a feeling of frustration in the third world, and it is certainly no consolation to know that the passage of time can only compound the problems, especially as the inexorable march of technology will tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.\n235.\tIn Stockholm, the issues posed by the threat to the human environment for which this same modern technology is so largely responsible were taken up. Malta was one of the first countries to refer to the problems of pollution in relation to the marine environment when it first raised the issue of the sea-bed in this Assembly some years ago. As such, Malta could not fail to take a keen interest, and to participate actively, in the deliberations of the Stockholm Conference. That Conference recognized that different degrees of development pose different threats to the human environment. In the affluent countries the threat to the environment derives from a high level of industrial activity accompanied by a high standard of living, with all its concomitant demands. On the contrary, in the developing countries the threat to the environment arises from conditions of poverty and under-development. It is therefore important that the aspect of development should not be divorced from the continued consideration of the problems of the environment.\n236.\tIn the Mediterranean, an area with which my country is intimately concerned, the problems of pollution derive from each of these two threats. Last July, Malta took the lead in convening a meeting of Mediterranean States  to discuss matters of common concern affecting the Mediterranean, not least the problem of pollution. It is hoped that that initiative will be followed by other concrete steps to strengthen regional co-operation in matters relating to the human environment within the global strategy which was endorsed at Stockholm,  among others.\n237.\tOne of the recommendations made by the Stockholm Conference concerned the establishment of a 54-member Governing Council for Environmental Programs and the creation of a secretariat to service it. The delegation of Malta, on that occasion, offered the capital of my country, Valletta, as a possible site for the environment secretariat. Today, I should like to repeat that offer.\n238.\tAnother field of United Nations activity in which Malta is keenly interested concerns the question of the sea-bed. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, in the work of which my delegation has participated actively, now approaches a crucial point in its existence. The General Assembly at its present session must review the work of the Committee and decide whether the conference on the law of the sea, tentatively scheduled for 1973 in accordance with resolution 2750 C (XXV), should be convened.\n239.\tWhile the delegation of Malta cannot express full satisfaction at the rate of progress of the Committee's work, it recognizes the complex causes, both substantive and organizational, that have made slow progress almost unavoidable. Although progress in the Committee has been slow, we believe that it has been sufficient to justify the convening on schedule of the conference on the law of the sea, particularly in view of the adoption by the Committee at its last session of a list of subjects and issues which will form the basis of discussion at the conference.\n240.\tThe positions of States on many questions relating to the law of the sea continue to remain far apart; yet we cannot afford to delay the forthcoming conference, for technology is advancing rapidly and the possibility is increasing that options will be closed and solutions imposed by those who have superior financial resources and technological capability.\n241.\tIf there is to be an early conference on the law of the sea, the United Nations sea-bed Committee must give its attention not only to negotiation of outstanding issues and to the preparation of draft treaty articles, but also to issues relating to the organization of the conference itself. This will require a broadening of the Committee's mandate, a step which we hope the General Assembly will take at its present session.\n242.\tOne of the items on the agenda of the present session concerns a review of the Charter of the United Nations [item 89]. My delegation is aware of the strong feelings aroused in many quarters by this item, and, to be quite frank, we do not believe that the time is ripe for the Charter to be profitably amended.\n243.\tIf the provisions of the present Charter are consistently violated, it would be naive to expect that an amended Charter would command greater adherence. Different or even improved procedures provide nothing more than a suitable framework for the interplay of national forces. As has been repeatedly stated, what is needed is not new procedures but a new \\\"political will\\\". Procedures in themselves will not function without the willingness to make them work, and, given such willingness, any procedure can be made to work well. None the less, it is pertinent to observe that certain provisions of the Charter not only appear to have outlived their purpose, but could even conceivably be invoked in support of gross violations of international peace and security. This is surely the case with Article 107 and, to a large extent, Article 53 of the Charter.\n244.\tAnother item on our agenda this year which has already engendered considerable feeling is that which our Secretary-General has proposed in connexion with international terrorism [item 92J. The Government and people of\nMalta, as befits a civilized country, condemn every act of blind violence, ever}' manifestation of hatred between peoples, every recourse to killing and bloodshed. We are also aware, however, that violence and terrorism are frequently symptoms of a disease. We cannot, therefore, seriously expect that by denouncing or condemning these acts, however deplorable they may be, we shall be making any useful contribution towards the more desirable objective of discovering the cure that will eradicate the disease or even prevent the recurrence of further outbreaks of violence.\n245.\tUnfortunately, the question of international violence has become entangled with such burning political issues as the conflict between the Arab States and Israel and the struggle against colonialism. In view of what happened recently in Munich and its aftermath, the issue has assumed even more the aspect of an extension of the Middle East dispute, a dispute from which Malta has kept scrupulously aloof and one which we have always deplored as a conflict between our friends. In the circumstances, much as we condemn acts of international violence and terrorism, we do not feel that we should be contributing towards a solution of this problem by denouncing either one side or the other. The road my Government has mapped out for itself does not lead to any denunciations; it only points towards a possible role of mediation by which the two sides may be brought together in search of a just and lasting solution.\n246.\tIn the field of disarmament, progress remains slow and halting, although perhaps there are grounds to hope for more concrete achievements as the spirit of detente gains momentum. Malta certainly welcomes the agreement on the limitation of strategic arms that has been concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union. We hope that this beginning will soon be followed by more significant achievements as a result of continued negotiations between the two Powers. The opening for signature of the new international Convention banning biological weapons signaled another landmark-not so much because of the nature of the weapons that have been banned as of the historical significance of a treaty which for the first time unconditionally bans certain weapons and which for that reason may be called a real disarmament measure.\n247.\tOn the other hand, I should be less than frank if I failed to express the disappointment of my Government that, despite all the efforts of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament throughout the year, no tangible progress has been recorded on what is widely regarded as the next front that has to crumble if disarmament is ever to have a chance of becoming reality: I refer to a complete ban on all nuclear testing and to the prohibition of chemical weapons. In the view of my delegation, progress on this front is essential if the proposed world disarmament conference is to be assured of a reasonable prospect of success. Similarly, the proposal before us for a declaration on the renunciation of the use of force and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [A/L.676], however appealing it may appear, can hardly be meaningful unless there is a break-through on the important questions of a complete ban on nuclear testing and the prohibition of chemical weapons.\n248.\tI have left to the end of my statement a brief reference to the policies of the Government of Malta and its preoccupations. In pursuit of its fundamental objective of friendly relations with all States, irrespective of ideology, my Government has during the past 12 months dispatched and received emissaries to and from a large number of countries, with all of which we seek to promote on a bilateral basis a form of collaboration that will be of mutual benefit to our respective peoples. All this Is being done with scrupulous adherence to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, while at the same time promoting greater international understanding. Especially in the Mediterranean, our relations with all the littoral States are excellent, and we for our part shall continue to strive for their further consolidation. If I single out for mention the very warm relations which Malta enjoys with its immediate neighbors to the north and to tine south, Italy and Libya, it is by no means to belittle others but mainly because, apart from the practical and valued co-operation with these two countries, their symbolic geographical position, as viewed from Malta, portrays our keen interest in promoting a dialog between Europe and Africa which inevitably embraces the Mediterranean.\n249.\tLast year, from this rostrum [1965th meeting], I spoke of Malta's dedication to the cause of peace in the Mediterranean and expressed our unhappiness at the fact that cruel economic necessity forced us to continue to make available the use of our facilities for military purposes. Since that time there has been a radical change in the contractual basis on which such facilities have continued to be made available. Apart from ensuring adequate compensation for the benefit of our economy, it is important to emphasize, first, that these facilities do not extend to fleets of either of the two super-Powers, which we consider extraneous to the Mediterranean. Secondly and this is of great significance-under no circumstances will such facilities ever be used for offensive purposes against anyone, least of all against our Arab friends. Finally, as my Prime Minister has repeatedly and publicly made clear, the presence of foreign forces in Malta is not intended to last for more than the period stipulated by written agreement, which will come to an end in 1979. By that time we hope to have progressed sufficiently in the restructuring of our economy to be able finally to do away with the necessity of having to host foreign forces under the pressure of sheer economic necessity. To help us achieve that goal, we confidently look to our friends in Europe and elsewhere and in particular to the European Economic Community, with which we are already associated, for the necessary moral and material support.\n"

While wishing you every success in the fulfillment of the tasks of your high office, I am confident that your acknowledged wisdom and your judgment will enable you to preside successfully over our deliberations in a manner which will attain the best possible results for this session.\n2.\tIn extending its congratulations to you, Mr. President, the Iraqi delegation is also expressing its satisfaction at the fact that this high office is occupied by a person who is a national of a country with which Iraq has the closest ties of friendship and co-operation.\n3.\tI should also like to pay a tribute, on this occasion, to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, for his valuable efforts in the service of the United Nations during his presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n4.\tThe people of Iraq follow with close attention the developments in all parts of the world. We believe that there is a great necessity for our international Organization to double its efforts to strengthen its sublime Charter and to accomplish its noble objectives.\n5.\tThe peoples of the third world, and other peace-loving peoples, have continued their struggle against colonialism, imperialism and backwardness; they have not yet, however, attained all that they desire. The roots of colonialism run\ndeep and are still alive with the forces of the authority and the exploitation which they have accumulated through the centuries.\n6.\tIn fact we have not noted since the end of the last session of the General Assembly any indication on the part of the colonialist States of a change in their policies or a readiness to co-operate with the United Nations in a constructive joint effort to honor the rights of peoples, to banish the prevalent fears and to eliminate the evils of greedy monopolies. Nevertheless, we shall remain optimistic because we have faith in the future of peoples and in their struggle for their just cause.\n7.\tThe foreign policy of the Republic of Iraq seeks to establish the best and soundest of relations with other States, based on the principles of respect for independence and sovereignty and mutual efforts for the development and strengthening of those relations. Our policy is one of strict adherence to, and support of, the Charter of the United Nations. We are also strongly in favor of creating circumstances for strengthening faith in the world Organization and its specialized agencies to enable them to fulfill their mission and to raise them to the level of their responsibilities.\n8.\tMany peoples have achieved, through persistent struggle, their right to freedom and self-determination. The United Nations, through its Declaration on the rights of peoples to self-determination and independence,  has itself played a prominent part in supporting and promoting the aspirations of those peoples.\n9.\tHowever, there are many other peoples still suffering under the yoke of colonialism, exploitation and racial discrimination.\n10.\tThe ugliest manifestation of this reality is perhaps to be found in what the world is now witnessing in Palestine.\n11.\tThe forces of Zionist colonialism, supported by international imperialism with the United States at its head, have been able to drive the people of Palestine out of their homeland and keep them out for nearly a quarter of a century. Since 5 June 1967 Zionist aggression has extended into three Arab States Members of this Organization, occupying parts of their territories, ejecting their inhabitants and establishing colonial para-military settlements in those occupied territories.\nA/PV.2055\n12.\tThe United Nations has reaffirmed in numerous resolutions the rights of the Palestinian people to repatriation and to self-determination. But because of Israel's contemptuous intransigence, and the failure of the United Nations to implement their provisions, those resolutions have been reduced to worthless scraps of paper.\n13.\tWe firmly believe that the so-called Middle East problem cannot be solved, and peace in our area cannot be achieved, unless the people of Palestine are given the opportunity to exercise all their inalienable rights, particularly their right to self-determination: neither can there be any peace unless the Israeli occupation of Arab territories is ended. Unless those conditions are achieved, the Middle East will remain charged with dangers imperiling world peace.\n14.\tA deep sense of injustice has driven the Palestinian people to ignite the flames of revolution. They have realized that there is no way for them to attain a free and respectable life, to return to the land of their fathers and forefathers, except through self-sacrifice and armed struggle, which represent the zenith of patriotism and the highest example of wars of liberation. The people of Palestine have come to know the meaning of this self- sacrifice in facing Zionist nazism, as many other peoples knew it in resisting Hitler's Nazi occupation.\n15.\tMy Government, from the very beginning, did not have much faith in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The resolution is not in conformity with the principles of the Charter, which prohibit the use of force in international relations and which clearly deny to the aggressor the enjoyment of any gain or advantages resulting therefrom. Yet, despite the resolution, with all its serious shortcomings both in form and in substance, Israel, which has never heeded United Nations resolutions concerning the rights of the Palestinian people, persists in its expansionist policies and tries to achieve further gains at the expense of the people of Palestine and of the Arab countries.\n16.\tTo deny the people of Palestine their rights, to try to settle the problem of Palestine without the participation of the Palestinians themselves, to ignore the resolutions adopted by the United Nations within the last quarter of a century to solve the problem, and then to reward the aggressor with concessions are the main deficiencies underlying Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n17.\tThe Security Council should have stipulated the determination of the Zionist aggression and the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied territories without any delay and without attaching any conditions to such stipulations.\n18.\tOne important aspect of the situation in the Middle East has become a source of deep concern for all the peoples of the world, namely, Israel's policies regarding the city of Jerusalem. The United Nations has adopted many resolutions, known to all, to preserve the character of Jerusalem as a city which is holy to many peoples and to many religions. Israel's response has again been one of complete disregard and arrogant disdain. Excavations and demolitions continue in many quarters of the city in complete indifference to its sanctity and to its archaeological landmarks, which unite the past with the present and represent man's heritage of civilization in our part of the world. Zionism has now come to destroy the relics of this heritage. In spite of the strong reactions of everyone who values all that Jerusalem represents, Israel, as always, has ignored-in fact, dismissed with contempt the great concern expressed by the international community.\n19.\tIsrael's expansionist settler colonialism is confirmed by its multi directional aggressions. Its aim is to conquer further territories and to induce further Jewish immigration into Palestine by every possible scheme, in order to realize the dreams of Zionist expansionism in establishing \\\"Greater Israel\\\". These are the factors which distinguish the problem of Palestine from the problems of other peoples whose lands have been partitioned, like Germany, Korea and Viet-Nam. The struggle in Palestine is not one between the countrymen of one land; it is one between the rightful owner and an intruder, between a usurping aggressor and the people made the victim of that aggression. It is only natural that those who ignore this basic nature of the conflict in Palestine should feel tempted to call for direct negotiations between the parties concerned.\n20.\tIn order to ensure respect for the Charter of the United Nations and observance of its principles as the basis of international relations, it is imperative, first and foremost, that the great Powers, which bear special responsibilities for preserving international security, should themselves respect the principles of the Charter. It is no secret that the people of Iraq, like many other peoples throughout the world, have come to question the value of the international Organization in maintaining peace and justice in view of the behavior of some of the great Powers among its Members.\n21.\tDuring last September Israel mounted a campaign of revenge and terrorism against Syria and Lebanon, directed above all against innocent civilians and the inhabitants of the Palestinian refugee camps. We have never doubted that Israel would never be content with the ejection of the Palestinians from their homeland, but would aim at their extermination and the annihilation of the very concept of the existence of a Palestinian people.\n22.\tWhat we did not expect, even from the United States with its well-known support and loyalty to Israel, was a resort to the use of the veto to defeat a draft resolution which only sought to restore a cease-fire violated by Israel in its murderous attacks against Lebanon and Syria. The Security Council was thus prevented from discharging its most elementary duty in the maintenance of international peace and security. Does anyone doubt the ulterior motives which led the United States Government to take that shameful attitude, exposing international peace and security to certain danger in the interests of its own political expediencies?\n23.\tThe reasons for the peoples' loss of confidence in the world Organization and for its failure to live up to the hopes placed in it are not to be found in its so-called neglect of acts of \\\"political terrorism\\\", as some have claimed, but rather in the impotence of the United Nations \nin the face of the international terrorism practiced by one of the major Powers among its own members against many peoples and in many different parts of the world.\n24.\tThe General Assembly has decided, at the request of the Secretary-General, to debate at its present session the subject of international terrorism with its underlying causes and motives [item 92]. My delegation believes that the consideration of the item in its amended form will clarify the full dimensions of this problem. But we cannot close our eyes to, nor remain silent about, a fact which by now is well-known to all, namely, the exploitation of this item by the United States for internal political purposes. Nor can we ignore the efforts by some other Powers to exploit this debate so as to discredit and to strangle national liberation movements, under the guise of combating terrorism and in the name of the international community.\n25.\tWe are greatly surprised to see that the Government of the United States should hasten to lead the campaign of what it terms combating terrorism, at a time when the United Nations itself and permanent missions here in New York are subjected to threats and acts of violence by American terrorist organizations, without the United States authorities taking any effective action against those terrorists in contravention of its contractual obligations towards the United Nations. We also find it totally unacceptable that the United States Government should, under the cloak of humanitarian motivations, call for action against terrorism while a deluge of American bombs engulfs the innocent women and children of Viet-Nam, and \\\"civilized\\\" American generals threaten to bomb that valiant people back to the Stone Age.\n26.\tThere exist in the Arabian Gulf area conditions which threaten peace and foreshadow dire consequences. Imperialism is actively trying to consolidate its influence in the Arabian Gulf under the pretext of filling a so-called vacuum in the wake of the withdrawal of British forces. In pursuit of these aims, international imperialism has no compunction about employing any and all available means.\n27.\tThe Iraqi Government is convinced that peace and security will not prevail in the Arabian Gulf unless the States in that area respect one another's sovereignty and independence. Towards the end of last year, however, Iranian forces occupied three Arab islands in the Gulf, resorting to the use of force to achieve Iran's expansionist ambitions, in violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law, which explicitly prohibit the use of force in international relations. The laxity of the United Nations organs in taking effective measures to restore right and justice is bound to encourage expansionist ambitions which would undoubtedly endanger international peace and security in the area.\n28.\tDuring the last two sessions of the General Assembly, the Iraqi delegation outlined the action of our neighbor Iran in unilaterally declaring the abrogation of the Iraqi-Iranian Boundary Treaty, signed at Teheran on 4 July 1937. This Treaty, in force for over 30 years, was freely concluded by both parties, and registered with the League of Nations, in order to put an end to their frontier differences. It appears that our neighbor Iran overlooked the fact that the sanctity of treaties is one of the fundamental principles of international law, and that the violation of treaties was, and is, among the gravest transgressions for which a State is held accountable to the international community. The unilateral abrogation of a treaty, for whatever reason, is considered one of the most serious of violations.\n29.\tIraq continues to maintain its adherence to the 1937 Treaty, and is convinced that Iran has no right to abrogate the Treaty unilaterally. Iraq has expressed its readiness to refer this question to the International Court of Justice. We hereby renew this offer. Iran's procrastinations in accepting our offer and its continued negative attitude are but an expression of Iran's determination to defy the most important and most securely established rules of international law.\n30.\tMy Government takes every possible opportunity to reaffirm its peaceful policies and its desire to establish the best of relations with all States. The latest affirmation of this policy towards Iran was expressed a few months ago by the President of Iraq, Mr. Ahmed Hassan Al-Bakr, when he stated:\n\\\"The Government of Iran, one of our neighbors, has for the last three and a half years adopted unwarranted hostile attitudes against Iraq and the Arab nation, as exemplified by its unilateral abrogation of the 1937 Boundary Treaty and the continued acts of provocation along our borders threatening our peace and security. It carried its policies to the extent of usurping parts of Arab lands in its occupation of the three Arab islands in the Arabian Gulf. These actions are bound to have harmful effects on Arab-Iranian relations, not only at present but also in the future, especially since they coincide with the Zionist-imperialist onslaught on the Arab people. We shall strongly uphold our rights and shall continue to oppose the use of such methods for the solution of problems. In our opinion, those methods constitute violations of international obligations in addition to being an outcome of outmoded policies. We reaffirm here again our respect for the historical ties which bind us to the friendly Iranian peoples as we reaffirm our sincere desire to establish good-neighborly relations with them on the basis of continued co-operation for the benefit of our mutual interests. We have for the last three-and-a-half years followed a policy of self-restraint and resorted to reason in confronting the adventurist policies into which the colonialist forces tried to draw us. While upholding our rights and national interests, we reiterate our readiness, always, to solve problems peacefully, provided the Government of Iran will reconsider its attitude, abandon its present policy and follow the path of good-neighborliness with Iraq and the Arab nation.\\\"\n31.\tIn the Far East, we are witnessing an appalling tragedy: the tragedy of the unequal war in Viet-Nam, the indiscriminate mass killings of the VietNamese people by the United States forces and the devastating destruction by its missiles, airplanes and napalm of Vietnamese civilian installations, including hospitals, schools and dikes.\n32.\tThe war in Viet-Nam has been condemned by all peoples of the world, including progressive liberals within the United States itself. Our people calls for the full and immediate withdrawal of United States forces from IndoChina, in order to enable its peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and to express their will freely without foreign intervention. Our people supports the proposal for- the establishment of an international body which would be entrusted with assisting Viet-Nam for the immediate rehabilitation of both North and South after the devastation of the prolonged years of fighting. The necessary resources for such rehabilitation should be provided by the United Nations: the rich States, headed by the United States, should provide the major part of such assistance. What we have said about the aggression against the Vietnamese people applies equally to the aggression against the peaceful people of Cambodia. Here was a nation enjoying freedom and full of hope, but the United States Government, which does not approve of those who refuse to fall into line with its policies, resorted to its well-known methods and intelligence services. Endangering the security and the stability of the Cambodian people, it installed a puppet regime to replace the legitimate Government, which still enjoys the support and the sympathy of the majority of peoples.\n33.\tThere are still a number of peoples languishing under the yoke of colonialism and vassalage. The Republic of Iraq calls upon the United Nations to rescue these peoples and to support their just struggle to achieve independence, thus implementing the United Nations' own resolutions and securing the realization of its aims and respect for its principles.\n34.\tWe demand the liquidation of all forms of colonialism, wherever found, and the elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations. Our people, under the leadership of the Socialist Arab Ba'ath Party, which has dedicated itself to the struggle for freedom and independence, stands with the peoples' legitimate resistance to colonialism, imperialism and discrimination. It demands the termination of the United States occupation of Korea and of the United States exploitation of the United Nations flag in its flagrant interference with the unity of the Korean people. We support the right of the Korean people to self-determination and to reunification. Our people supports the liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde. It condemns the white minority regime in Rhodesia and sincerely hopes that all States will respect United Nations resolutions and refrain from establishing any economic relations with Ian Smith's illegal regime.\n35.\tWe condemn the policies of apartheid and the repression imposed by the South African Government on the Africans, the indigenous people of the land. We cannot help but salute, on this occasion, the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe and pay a tribute to their struggle, in the hope that they will soon achieve their freedom and enjoy full sovereignty and independence.\n36.\tThe people of Iraq has chosen the policy of non-alignment in iis international relations, thus providing itself with the opportunity to participate in joint efforts for the realization of peace and security and to avoid the evils of aggressive pacts, with all their propensity to create confrontations and crises. The world has already seen the effectiveness of the policies of non-alignment in sparing mankind the consequences of blocs and military alliances.\n37.\tThe Republic of Iraq would welcome any sound agreement concerning the limitation of the armaments race. The arrival at a comprehensive agreement on disarmament would undoubtedly diminish the dangers of war and save vast sums which might be diverted to peaceful purposes, especially to assistance to the developing countries.\n38.\tWe support complete disarmament under effective international control and confirm our support for the prohibition of the use and the manufacture of chemical, biological and other similar weapons. My Government associates itself with the proposals concerning the declaration of certain areas as zones of peace. It also supports the convocation of a world conference on disarmament.\n39.\tMy Government welcomes all efforts aimed at the utilization of atomic energy, the sea-bed and outer space for peaceful purposes. It would welcome a conference on the law of the sea, provided that adequate preparation were made to ensure its success in a manner which would guarantee the interests of all States and especially those of the developing countries. Special attention should be given to the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  and the proposals made by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in order to see that justice is done to the developing countries, to enable them to utilize their resources and, finally, to create the conditions which would narrow the gap between the developing and the developed countries.\n40.\tOn this occasion I should like to refer briefly to the measures taken by my Government on 1 July of this year to nationalize the operations of the Iraq Petroleum Company.\n41.\tThat company, which had monopolized our petroleum resources for nearly half a century, went too far in ignoring our just demands and adopted a policy of procrastination and equivocation regarding those demands. While the Iraqi Government tried earnestly to arrive at a just solution to the problems outstanding, the company resorted to pressure tactics by reducing production in order to undermine the economy of the country. Those tactics led the negotiations which had been going on for many years into an impasse. It was then the duty of the Government to nationalize the company's operations in order to safeguard the rights of the people. In following this course of action Iraq was exercising a definite right recognized by international law and stated in numerous United Nations resolutions which affirm the sovereignty of States over their natural resources. In the nationalization decree we have declared our readiness to compensate the company.\n42.\tIn his eloquent statement before the General Assembly Mr. Maurice Schumann said that hope was \\\"a difficult virtue\\\" [2041st meeting, para. 60J. Although I have expressed here today the apprehensions and suspicions which preoccupy the minds of many peoples about the role of the United Nations and its ability to rise to the level of the hopes placed in it, I personally still greatly hope that these suspicions will not be confirmed.\n43.\tThe peoples of the whole world are united in the desire to establish an international community, living in peace, in which the principles of freedom and justice prevail. Those peoples regard the United Nations as the only means for attaining that goal. Although it is true that much of that hope for the United Nations has evaporated, our faith in man and in his determination to realize his longings for freedom, peace and justice saves us from total despair. It enables us to continue our support for the United Nations so that we may attain mankind's common goal.\n"

        "file_text": "It is of special and symbolic significance to me that my first major statement outside of Jamaica since my election to office earlier this year should be made here, before this Assembly, in which so many of the hopes of mankind are invested, and I return thanks to God and to the people of Jamaica for making this possible.\n25.\tMr. President, may I extend to you, on behalf of the Government and the people of Jamaica, our congratulations on your election to the office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. As a distinguished son of Poland, you have been a steadfast contributor to the principles on which this Organization was founded. Your election, therefore, is a tribute not only to your great country and to you personally but also to the Eastern European group of nations, which you represent.\n26.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who so ably guided our deliberations during the last session.\n27.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our satisfaction at the dynamism he has displayed since assuming the office of the Secretary-General.\n28.\tIt may surprise you, Mr. President, to learn that I hesitated long before deciding to come and make this statement myself. I hesitated because so many great voices have spoken with passion, eloquence and cogency about the world's problems that I realized that it would not lie within my powers to bring a new revelation to the continuing debate about the world and its crises. But in the end I decided to come because, with all its institutional limitations, this Organization, the United Nations, and this General Assembly still represent the highest aspirations of mankind and still offer the most efficient instrument that man has devised to translate these aspirations into reality for the benefit of all.\n29.\tTherefore, may I speak to the Assembly, first, as the leader of a small and young nation and. second, in all humility for myself as a human being, and may I briefly redirect members' attention to the fundamental root and source of the continuing crises in human affairs which directly threatens the future of mankind and underlies so many current dislocations, tensions, upheavals and, indeed, violence around the globe.\n30.\tAs I said, my words cannot be new, because the world's problems do not arise from what men have said in this hall, but rather from the stubborn refusal of men to listen.\n31.\tSimply put, this Assembly has become known as a place where torrents of words that burn with urgency and truth fall upon deaf ears-ears that are often closed by the narrowest considerations of national self-interest. The continuing inability of the United Nations to mediate situations of international crisis and reduce the inequalities between nations does not reflect any lack of desire or skill among the staff of this Organization or its various agencies. I suggest rather that the inadequacies of the United Nations precisely reflect the misplaced priorities of its Member nations and especially of the most powerful and wealthy ones among them.\n32.\tI speak today for a new administration in Jamaica which has a clear and simple philosophy about human affairs. We believe that the idea of equality is the only enduring principle by which mankind may be guided in the conduct of national and international affairs. We believe, further, that the survival of mankind itself depends upon the speed with which man comes to learn that there must be a universal moral foundation for the conduct of affairs and that in the absence of a universal morality to determine relations within societies and as between nations modern technology will eventually destroy us.\n33.\tTherefore, we begin with the thesis that unemployment and poverty, malnutrition, inadequate housing existing side by side with conspicuous affluence represent an intolerable invasion of the principle of equality and represent a challenge to the will of our nation which must be faced and overcome.\n34.\tAnd, equally, we believe that the international juxtaposition of wealthy nations and poor nations is an affront to both the conscience and the common sense of mankind.\n35.\tIf we fail within Jamaica to build a society of equality and to achieve an equitable distribution of wealth among all our people, we will have failed our generation and history will exact its price.\n36.\tBut equally, if the international community fails to build an order that is founded upon the equitable distribution of the world's wealth, generations will arise that will sweep us away.\n37.\tMay I remind this Assembly of the two critical elements in our present dilemma. On the one hand, colonialism and technology have combined to create an intolerable and self-perpetuating disproportion between the wealth of nations. On the other hand, one of the most dangerous of man's gifts is his ability to mask the raw pursuit of self-interest behind the rhetoric of good intentions but technology has spread the rhetoric to the four corners of the globe and created a world that is no longer merely content to hope for social justice, but has come to demand it as a matter of right.\n38.\tI believe that the United Nations at this moment is in danger of losing its collective will to pursue right. I believe that the wars which have raged unchecked, the pursuit of national self-interest by the great Powers and indeed by some of the small Powers too, the manipulation of focal points of tension by the great Powers to their own ends and purposes, and the continuing paralysis of the United Nations in the face of this sordid spectacle, are creating the danger that we may forfeit our collective will and see our resolve sink finally into the quicksands of cynicism. My plea, therefore, is the same to you as it is to my own people.\n39.\tAt home, we have launched a massive literacy campaign because a just society cannot function unless the doors of knowledge through reading are open to all the people. We are mobilizing our resources behind the elementary requirements of jobs, food and shelter for the people. We are seeking to mobilize these resources in the name of equality and through the method of self-reliance.\n40.\tAnd here today, my plea to the world is for a re-commitment to international morality for its own sake and as the condition of survival.\n41.\tLet me begin with the simplest possible illustration of what I mean by \\\"international morality\\\". The Government of Jamaica is proud of the fact that its initiative in relation to Southern Rhodesian participation in the Olympic Games led to an international process that ended with the repudiation of a formula for Southern Rhodesia's participation because that formula was totally inconsistent with any moral principle properly understood. We thank our African colleagues for their support, but we note the whole sequence of events with a residual concern.\n42.\tBecause of our adherence to the principle of international morality, I declare that the new Government of Jamaica is totally and bitterly opposed to the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia and to the continuing Portuguese tyranny in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). I also note with concern recent developments in Uganda.\n43.\tNow that the overwhelming majority of the people of Southern Rhodesia have answered the inquiries of the Pearce Commission, we call upon the United Kingdom, once again, to bring that illegal, racist regime to an end.\n44.\tI am proud to declare our unswerving support for the freedom fighters of Africa in their struggle for independence. I am equally proud that it was Jamaica, under the leadership of my late father, that was the first country in the world to forbid trade with South Africa and I believe that, small as we are, we pointed a moral direction for mankind to follow. Today, I reconfirm Jamaica's support of the various resolutions that call for economic sanctions against Portugal. However, I am concerned to note that once again there is evidence of international double-talk in respect of trade with Portugal. Among other things, I discovered that, in spite of Jamaica's support of Assembly resolutions calling for sanctions, we are actually conducting trade with that country. And I am announcing here and now that the Government of Jamaica will be taking steps to bring all trade with Portugal to a halt until its African colonies have won their freedom.\n45.\tI turn now to the question of international terrorism and note with pleasure that the item, as amended by Jamaica, is to be debated [item 92]. Let me state Jamaica's position flatly.\n46.\tWhenever the means of peaceful political action to correct oppression are effectively denied a people, we accept and support absolutely the right of the oppressed to fight for freedom and justice against the apparatus of authority that oppresses them. On the other hand, we totally and irrevocably repudiate all acts of violence which are directed against innocent third parties who have nothing to do with the- dispute.\n47.\tI turn now from the question of international morality in the political arena to the problem of the world, its wealth and the developing nations.\n48.\tThe question of how the terrible inequalities of wealth between nations arose in the course of history has been thoroughly analyzed, massively documented and is completely understood. But two questions arise now. Should the present position be allowed to continue; and, if the answer is \\\"no\\\", have we the will to correct it? For let me be clear, I stress the word \\\"will\\\" because the question of technique does not arise.\n49.\tEverybody knows perfectly' well what needs to be done to reverse the process by which rich nations get richer while poor nations get relatively poorer. The world's crisis arises because the major economic Powers are slow to accept the fact that our view of international economic relationships must undergo a transformation as total as that which brought political colonialism more or less to an end. I suggest that, to survive, the world must make the sort of commitment in the economic field that it is learning to make politically and racially; and it must do so, I repeat, as the condition of survival.\n50.\tWe know that at the heart of our economic problem are to be found three questions: the terms of trade, the price of money and the basis on which the proceeds that arise from the exploitation of natural resources are shared between the countries that have the resources and those that provide the capital and the know-how necessary for their exploitation. However, while we talk about these problems and indulge yesterday's fantasies about the exclusive and prescriptive rights of capital, the world sinks into an ever-widening abyss of inequality. Massive unemployment coexists with spectacular monuments to capital- intensive technology; the endless rows of shanty-town shacks are mocked by the high-rise condominiums of the affluent; levels of unemployment exist around the developing world which would tear apart the very fabric of metropolitian society; and everywhere there is the silent reproach to man's conscience of the young children trying to find a way to grow without the food, the shelter or the settled family patterns that they need.\n51.\tWhat, then, can we do? To start with, we must summon our collective will and find the key to the international conscience, because without that the doors will not open. More specifically, reminding you that we are in the Second Development Decade, I wish to make a series of specific recommendations for the consideration of this great body and the many specialized agencies that it directs.\n52.\tIn the first place, I think that we must apply our minds to the role. ? ;ope and powers of the Economic and Social Council. This is the body that we have charged with the tremendous task of overseeing the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. However, it is impossible to implement a strategy if all the tactical elements are not working in harmony.\n53.\tNoting with pleasure that the Economic and Social Council has recently been expanded, I now call upon the Assembly to take whatever steps are needed to ensure that the full power and authority to co-ordinate a coherent, integrated global development strategy rest clearly with the Economic and Social Council. It is entirely self-defeating for the Council to devise a strategy of development that is aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor countries and at assaulting world-wide problems of poverty and unemployment, only to find that the specialized agencies through which the Council must function are devoted to policies that are often in conflict with every thrust of central development planning. With respect, I suggest that this is a situation that is as illogical as it is unacceptable\n54.\tEqually, in dealing with a development strategy, it is vital that the people who must plan should be kept free of the distraction of other problems, however important. I would suggest, then, that the direction of the Commission on Human Rights be removed from the immediate concern of the Economic and Social Council and that a human rights council be created which might well be merged with the Trusteeship Council. One is pleased to find that this latter is rapidly becoming self-liquidating as it approaches the completion of the tasks which were entrusted to it.\n55.\tBefore I turn to more specifics in the area of world economics, I should like to press upon your attention a central concern of mine. It is increasingly understood that it is impossible to separate the economic from the social aspects of development; and I will not bore you with a recitation of the interrelationships that are involved. However, I come increasingly to the conclusion that the world which came to understand that there is a close relationship between health and economic development, and later between education and economic development, must now need to understand that there is an even closer relationship between housing and economic development.\n56.\tI am convinced that housing is going to have to become the great new area of world concern and effort. It seems to me that, in the absence of a home, much else that we seek to plan and to achieve is frustrated and overwhelmed by the sheer, brutal reality of shanty-town life. I believe that much of education is lost upon a child who returns from school to share one room with his brothers, sisters and parents. I believe that many of the hostilities and tensions which frustrate the economic process can be traced, at least in part, to this problem. Therefore I wish to suggest that the international community should address its mind to the development of a world-wide plan for housing. I was pleased to see that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has taken note of this problem and called for support for the housing fund that was proposed at that Conference. I suggest that formulas be explored for ensuring that funds for housing become a planned and standard addition wherever investment capital moves.\n57.\tIn the more obviously economic area, we will propose that the entire basis on which special drawing rights are handled should be revised. Special drawing rights should be a key element in the whole process by which capital for development purposes is transferred from the metropolitan to the developing countries.\n58.\tEqually, I wish to draw attention to the rules that govern the availability of soft loans, through the international monetary agencies, to the developing world. The present criterion for eligibility for soft loans that distinguishes nations on the basis of per capita income is clearly inadequate. Obviously, per capita income is no measure of the ability of an economy to provide a life for all its people and shows only that there is some wealth for some people. I propose, then, that we work out additional criteria under which developing countries may qualify for low-interest loans, and I make two specific proposals to that end: firstly, that high rates of unemployment in a country should be accepted as a measure for eligibility wherever that exceeds some predetermined level and, secondly, that certain social priorities should be isolated for soft loan purposes, regardless of other circumstances. The most important of these should be housing.\n59.\tI should now like to turn to an even more fundamental consideration of world economics. It has always been assumed that the continuing imbalance between the living standards of the nations must be adjusted by transfers of aid and technical know-how from developed to developing States. However, the international community counts as aid certain kinds of capital movement whose net effect can only be to increase the long-term drain on the resources of the poorer States. At the same time, the United Nations sets targets for the amount of total aid which should be given. To begin with, there is doubt whether those targets are adequate, but not even those targets are ever met. Yet no sense of urgency infuses our discussion of this problem.\n60.\tAre we prepared to face the facts? This widening gap will never be closed by economic aid alone, for the simple reason that the established system of economic relations between developed and developing nations works in the opposite direction. Under the established system, which has thus far been singularly resistant to change, the lion's share of the gains from international trade and investment from the extraction, conversion and sale of the world's raw materials accrues to those who command supplies of capital and know-how, and these are inevitably the developed nations.\n61.\tNothing less, then, than a reorganization of the system, of the basic economic relations between the two groups, gives any real hope of ever narrowing that gap. I think that the leaders of the developed nations have a moral obligation to address their minds, with us, to this reorganization, an obligation based sometimes on historical facts concerning the original sources of their present wealth, but also based on simple common sense about the future condition of mankind. Some other basis must be found, and soon, for the international distribution of the gains from international economic activity. I think that these leaders have a duty to make clear to their own citizens that, unless they are to continue as islands of affluence and luxury surrounded by seas of poverty and misery, we just cannot all go on having business as usual, profits as usual, national growth rates as usual. Some sacrifice on their own part must also be involved. I say, let the process of adjustment in these gains between developed and developing States begin with what we, the developing countries, own: our mineral resources.\n62.\tThe time has come to reconstruct the basis on which the gains arising from the exploitation of these resources are shared between those, on the one hand, who provide the capital and know-how, and those, on the other, who own the resources and provide the essential infrastructure and the labor force. Let the resources continue in our ownership from the point of extraction to the final sale of the processed product. Let the agreements of the future cover, not the sale of our resources to developed countries, but the reasonable payments which shall be made to those who supply capital and know-how for their services in the process of conversion.\n63.\tIt will be recalled that I spoke earlier, in relation to my own country, of the method of self-reliance. I believe that this has relevance and application in the international field in so far as the developing countries are concerned. We have a responsibility to ourselves to explore every avenue through which we can promote our own development. This is going to require the planned exploration of trading opportunities within the developing world; it is also going to demand the creation of institutions through which we can mobilize our own savings and apply them to our own concept of priorities. In response to similar needs and common pressure, the developing world is evolving its own know-how and ought now to establish the closest communication in the area of indigenous technology and organization.\n64.\tIt is my firm belief that, along with the increasing exploration of trading opportunities, the Member States of the developing world should plan to set aside an agreed share of national income for joint development purposes and to create appropriate institutions through which this capital may be invested.\n65.\tIt is my belief that a fund generated in this way could make a major contribution to international progress and be a sign to the world of the capacity of developing nations to promote the conditions of their own development through international co-operation in their own ranks.\n66.\tTo this end, and if the idea finds favor, my Government proposes to invite other developing nations to attend a conference in Jamaica in 1973 to discuss the ways and means of implementing this proposal.\n67.\tAnd so, I end as I began, humble in the face of the awesome responsibility that faces all those who aspire to leadership and conscious of the great voices which have bespoken the cause of peace and justice from this rostrum.\n68.\tMay I urge the members of this Assembly to remember that throughout history there have always been those who have called for the creation of a moral frame within which men and nations may deal with one another. More than ever it is those voices that we must heed. The requirements of survival and justice demand that we listen and act, and now.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my Foreign Secretary had hoped to have been able to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Somali Government, but, together with our Head of State, he has been engaged in a very urgent peace-making mission on behalf of the OAU. Since the mission is in its final stage and requires his presence in East Africa, he has asked me to undertake this task.\n193.\tHe has asked me to convey to you his most sincere congratulations on your accession to the office of President of the General Assembly an honor which you have justly earned and which does credit to your great country.\n194.\tThe principles and practical considerations which direct the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic in its international relations have often been described in this Assembly and can be summed up as a firm belief that the structure of world peace must be built, brick by brick, on the foundations of the Charter and within the walls of the United Nations. In the' past we have sometimes expressed great confidence in the ability of the world body to fulfill its mission to preserve international peace, and we have sometimes been deeply pessimistic about the viability of the United Nations. After 12 years of membership and, I believe, of fruitful involvement in international affairs, we realize that neither unrestrained enthusiasm nor undue pessimism are called for. The United Nations, like all living organisms, has strengths and weaknesses. The important thing is that it is alive. The important task for all of us is to ensure that it continues to have vigorous life. For there is no alternative besides chaos to the attempt to build up effective systems of international morality, international law and international government. As the Secretary-General has emphasized, the nations of the world cannot return to old theories of the balance of power that served different times and different conditions.\n195.\tIn a world situation dominated by the confrontation of opposing ideologies, by the gap between rich and developing nations, and by the threat of nuclear warfare, it would be folly to suppose that international affairs can be left entirely to the direction of the powerful few or to the unfettered play of national self-interest. And yet, the deterioration of long-standing problems which threaten international peace, and many of the events of the past year show that, however much the ideal of an international system is accepted in principle, in practice that ideal counts for little. We have allowed international political theory to outstrip international political action.\n196.\tThis is why, in the opinion of my delegation, the most important of the continuing items on the agenda of the General Assembly is the debate on the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [item 35]. That Declaration [resolution 2734 (XXV)] is a blueprint for the practical application of the doctrine of collective responsibility for international peace. It contains the guidelines for action on every major question that comes within the purview of the world Organization.\n197.\tThe Declaration was warmly welcomed by the group of non-aligned States, of which Somalia is a member, because it stands squarely for the authority of the Charter and the authority of the principal organs of the United Nations; because it seeks to devise rules of behavior which will eliminate the use of force in international relations; because it adds a new element to the call for general and complete disarmament by underlining the connexion be-tween the annual world expenditure on armaments and the increasing gap between the rich and the developing nations; and because it condemns the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms caused by colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination. It is in the light of the principles enunciated in the Declaration that my Government will state its views on those international issues which are the concern of all Member States.\n198. My Government firmly believes that one of the strongest supports of the structure of international peace which the world Organization is attempting to build is the expanding role of regional organizations. The OAU is engaged in the constructive task of trying to eliminate regional conflicts, of strengthening regional ties and developing regional co-operation. In recent weeks this has been clearly demonstrated in the dispute between Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and the serious situation that developed between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. In the case of the former dispute much credit must go to the distinguished heads of State of the People's Republic of the Congo and of Zaire for proffering their good offices and to the Governments of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea for accepting them. The positive response of the Ugandan and Tanzanian Governments to the peace efforts of my own Government, acting on behalf of the OAU, has arrested a potentially dangerous situation and holds a great promise of restoring understanding and peaceful relations between two States which have always had a unique history of friend-ship.\n199.\tOne area in which international action lags sadly behind international political philosophy is the area of human rights, particularly as this concept applies to the oppressed people of southern Africa. The southern African brand of racism has been condemned by the overwhelming majority of Member States as an affront to human dignity and a crime against the conscience of the world. And yet, racism and colonialism outside of southern Africa join hands with the racism and colonialism of the minority regimes to ensure that white privilege will be maintained at the expense of the basic human rights of the non-white people. The racism that is open and unashamed within southern Africa exists under cover among the allies and trading partners of the white minority regimes. Inside and outside of southern Africa, neo-colonialism either feeds directly on the life blood of the native majority or supports the systems which so unjustly oppress that majority. Racism, expressed as the ties of kith and kin, and neo-colonialism in the form of quick returns on investments based on slave labour these are the factors which outweigh considerations of human rights and of criminal injustice. These are the reasons why those members of the international community which are most capable of taking effective action in support of United Nations objectives for southern Africa withhold their support.\n200.\tThe charge of moral bankruptcy can indeed be leveled at the United Nations for its failure to deal with southern African problems which not only involve human rights but which constitute a threat to international peace and security. It is a sign of moral bankruptcy when the United Nations campaign to eliminate apartheid is weaHned by the non-compliance of powerful Member States with relevant resolutions, not only of the General Assembly, but also of the Security Council; it is moral bankruptcy when the rebel regime of Rhodesia is encouraged, by overt and covert sanctions-breaking, to intensify the application of apartheid policies to the African people of that Territory; it is moral bankruptcy when Portugal, a country waging major colonial wars against liberation forces in all the African territories under its control, is given massive financial and military support by its NATO partners; it is moral bankruptcy when the giant corporations of certain Western Powers, with the help and complicity in some cases of their Governments, join hands with the South African authorities in using and profiting from the infamous contract labor system in Namibia and elsewhere.\n201.\tThe situation in Namibia has, of course, the gravest implications for the authority of the United Nations because of the special responsibility of the Organization for the Territory and because of the ruling of the World Court on the obligations of States in the present situation.  My Government has already made it clear that, while it will not oppose any attempt at bringing Namibia peacefully to independence, it will always insist that certain basic principles remain unchanged. Namibia must be a single, homogeneous State, not one divided and weakened by the imposition of Bantustans. The United Nations must never relinquish its responsibility for bringing the people of the Territory to self-determination and independence and the basis for that independence must be full political equality, the elimination of all racial discrimination and equality of opportunity for all the inhabitants of the Territory.\n202.\tThe United Nations also has a special responsibility for helping the people of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) to achieve independence on the basis of equal rights for all its people. That responsibility was assumed, at the request of the administering Power, when the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, imposed by its resolution 253 (1968) economic sanctions against the Territory in order to put an end to the illegal regime. It is now seven years since that action was taken, but today the Southern Rhodesian problem is as far from solution as it ever was. Indeed, the steady erosion of justice inside Southern Rhodesia seems to be matched by the erosion of some Member States' sense of moral responsibility towards the Territory. Now that the unacceptable settlement devised by Britain and the rebel regime has been firmly rejected by the African majority, neither Britain's responsibility nor the United Nations responsibility for the Territory has ended. But the recent veto by Britain at the 1666th meeting of the Security Council of an African draft resolution on Southern Rhodesia reaffirming basic principles of international action,  points to a withdrawal from earlier positions which supported the oppressed people of the Territory. The fact that Britain's friends and allies on the Security Council abstained in the vote on the draft resolution was a further abrogation and a further retreat from responsibility.\n203.\tThe African draft resolution sought first of all to reaffirm the principle of no independence without majority rule. This is a principle which is insisted upon by the true leaders of the African majority in Southern Rhodesia; it is a principle that is supported by the non-aligned group of States and had the full backing of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, which met at Rabat in July. In addition, it has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the General Assembly [resolution 2877 (XXVI)]. I state these facts to show that in vetoing this principle-and\nMember States were given an opportunity to vote on it separately\u2014Britain was opposing the consensus of the world community. It was also, in effect, shrugging off the plea of the African people that it should not abandon them until they are firmly established in a position where they can claim the political and social rights that are their due.\n204.\tThe draft resolution also sought to establish, as a basis for a new initiative on Southern Rhodesia, that there should be a process of democratic consultation with all the people. Apart from the logic and the justice of this proposal, its necessity would seem obvious, following the complete failure of the attempt to impose a settlement that had been negotiated without any significant consultation with any of the African sections of the population or their political leaders. This eminently reasonable proposal has been rejected, as well as the call for the administering Power to seek ways of according to the people of Southern Rhodesia such accepted norms of political development as universal adult suffrage, secret ballot and the principle of one man, one vote\\\".\n205.\tBritain's rejection of the principles which must be the basis for any just and lasting settlement of Southern Rhodesian problems, and the indifference of its allies, come as a shock and a cause of deep disappointment to many States, both in and outside of Africa.\n206.\tAnother disappointing aspect of the Rhodesian situation is that the United States will continue to break international law and undermine the authority of the Security Council by openly violating the sanctions against Southern Rhodesia which it is pledged to enforce. While the United States is not the only country which has broken sanctions, and its Rhodesian imports are a small percentage of the illegal trade with that Territory, it cannot be denied that its importations of chrome, nickel and other ores is the result of a deliberate decision of the United States Government and sets an example that ill befits a world Power. The United States cannot escape its position of world leadership or the responsibilities of that position.\n207.\tThe African States have always held that economic sanctions are not the only means of bringing an end to the rebel regime, but they do believe that sanctions are an important measure and that, having been instituted under the authority of the United Nations, they must continue to be enforced. It was the firm consensus of the Rabat African summit Conference that now. more ever, the United Nations should keep up the pres.are the illegal regime so that it is forced to struggle for economic survival and to feel the discomforts of isolation. Nov/, more than ever, the Smith regime should be made aware that its attempts to impose the apartheid system on the African people of Southern Rhodesia will be opposed by the world community with all the means at its disposal. Instead what do we find? We find sanctions widely ignored, even by States which claim to observe them, and the United States justifying its open violations on the unseemly grounds that other Powers are equally or more at fault in this matter.\n208.\tObviously we are witnessing in the case of Southern Rhodesia the same disregard for the authority of the United Nations, the same withdrawal from responsibility on the part of those most able to take effective action, the same drift towards support for the racist regime that characterize the other unjust situations in southern Africa. My Government is convinced, however, that in the course of this session of the General Assembly the moral weight of the world community will be directed towards preventing a deterioration of the Rhodesian situation and towards reaffirming the commitment of the United Nations to the task of seeking justice for the people of that Territory.\n209.\tThe challenge presented by racism and colonialism in southern Africa as a whole has never been greater than at the present time. My Government believes that strong emphasis must now be placed on support for the liberation movements of that area. We believe it is necessary for Member States to go a step beyond the mere recognition of the legitimacy of the liberation struggle and to take positive measures in support of that struggle. We fully support the Mogadishu Declaration, adopted by the leaders of East and Central African States, which concluded that, since all avenues for a just and peaceful settlement of the problems of southern Africa had been rejected by the minority regimes, there was no way left for the liberation of the region except armed struggle.\n210.\tThere are many who belittle the role and the motives of the freedom fighters, but this can only be through the bias of racism. The freedom fighters of southern Africa are not* less justified and not less heroic in their struggle than the members of the European underground who fought their Nazi oppressors in the Second World War and who are still held up as examples of courage and self-sacrifice in the cause of patriotism.\n211.\tMoral leadership in this matter has been given by the World Council of Churches and by the grass-roots movements of individuals and non-governmental organizations in many of the countries which are southern Africa's main trading partners. It is the hope of my Government that that example will be widely followed.\n212.\tThe problems of southern Africa of course loom large in any consideration of colonialism, but it would be unfortunate if these problems were to overshadow completely the problems of smaller Territories in other areas which are also still caught up in the struggle for independence. These countries must continue to receive the attention and support of the United Nations. In addition to its interests in other colonial situations, my country has made it a cardinal point of its policy to advocate the right of self-determination and independence for the people of French Somaliland. This year two important international resolutions supporting the political rights of the people of that country were adopted by the international community. The first was in Rabat, in June 1972, when the summit conference of the OAU affirmed its support of the right of the people to self-determination and independence and called upon France to create the conditions-as France had done in the past in other colonial Territories so that those rights could be freely, equally and fully expressed. The same resolution was subsequently endorsed by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries during its meeting in Georgetown, Guyana, two months later.\n213.\tThe Middle East question, that perennial source of violent conflict, presents another example of how the best efforts of the world community to bring about just settlements can founder on the rock of national intransigence and can be frustrated by the determined refusal of a State to act within the framework of international law that it is pledged to uphold.\n214.\tThe retention by Israel of Arab territory, illegally seized and held since 1967, is a setback to the development of international law; it is a hindrance to the strengthening of international security. The Israelis have now publicly admitted what the world has long known, that they initiated the war of June 1967, that theirs was the first surprise attack. Even within Israel itself there is recognition of the fact that violent conflict with Arab neighbors was not inevitable and that the tensions existing then could have been reduced by international diplomacy. Armed aggression against other States, forceful and illegal territorial acquisitions, contravention of international agreements on the treatment of occupied territories, defiance of the clearly expressed consensus of the international community and of the Security Council-these are some of the grave offenses against international law and order that have been committed by Israel.\n215.\tBut the root-cause of the continuing violence in the Middle East over the past 25 years has been Israel's refusal to accord to the Palestinian refugees their rights, an obligation which was clearly a condition of Israel's recognition as a State by the United Nations, an obligation which is clearly spell out in numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and an obligation whose fulfillment is called for by Security Council resolution 242(1967). Wrongs left unrighted inevitably create an expanding circle of violence and counter-violence. Of one thing we can be certain: there will be no peace in the Middle East until the wrongs done to the Palestinian people have been righted and until Arab territory illegally seized by Israel has been returned.\n216.\tOne of the most distressing failures of the United Nations, in the view of my Government, and one which was highlighted during the recent 1661st meeting of the Security Council meeting requested by Lebanon, is the increasing unwillingness of some members of the Security Council to put the cessation of hostilities between States above considerations of national self-interest. The recent use of the veto at the Council's 1662nd meeting by a permanent member to kill a resolution which merely called for an end to armed hostilities in the Middle East region is a case in point, and the misrepresentation of this issue by the news media in this country did nothing to improve an unfortunate situation.\n217.\tOne would think that the primary purpose of the Security Council would be to try to put a stop to hostilities, particularly when these are being carried out by the armed forces of a State over which that State has direct control. The question of what might have constituted provocation of the hostilities was a separate matter and any member of the Council was free to bring that matter before the Council. In the view of my Government and this view has been expressed on several occasions in the past the use of the veto to inhibit the Security Council from exercising its primary responsibility for peace-keeping Was most deplorable. It was a serious blow to the development of the peace-keeping capacities of the United Nations.\n218.\tThe world-wide phenomenon of terrorism, which has many aspects, national and international, political and non-political, has become one of general concern, and the Secretary-General's initiative requesting that this matter be debated by the General Assembly [A/8791 and Add.l ] reflects that concern. It is now, of course, widely recognized that this question is a difficult and complex one and that its study must be undertaken with certain important guidelines clearly in view.\n219.\tSome of these have been indicated by the Secretary-General in his statement in support of his request for a debate on terrorism [A/8791/Add.lJ, and it is important that they be carefully followed. He has pointed out, for example, that the underlying causes of terrorism cannot be ignored and that a clear distinction must be maintained between terrorism and the struggle of people fighting for their freedom and independence rights that are supported by the Charter.\n220.\tIt has been asserted by some speakers in this debate that international action against terrorism would obviously not be directed against liberation movements such as those of southern Africa. None the less, the need remains for clear-cut safeguards of the rights of those engaged in the struggle for basic human rights and for self-determination. The liberation fighters of southern Africa have been labeled \\\"terrorists\\\" by the white minority regimes and are considered as such by some of their friends and allies, even though the southern African liberation struggle has been declared legitimate by the United Nations. It would be a tragic blow to the cause of freedom and justice in southern Africa and elsewhere if the forces of racism and colonialism were to be given an opportunity to cover with an air of legality their harsh suppression of all who oppose their policies.\n221.\tAs far as isolated acts of terrorism which involve innocent people are concerned, my Government deplores them and holds that they cannot in themselves be condoned. But we do not believe that those acts which are politically motivated can be divorced from their root-causes when those causes include the suffering of long-standing evils which have been recognized by the international community but allowed to continue without hope of redress; when those causes have given rise to struggles that have been recognized as legitimate and when every avenue of peaceful change has been closed to those who seek justice.\n222.\tA few years ago the historian Arnold Toynbee, on a visit to the United States, said:\n\\\"One of the most serious evils in the world today is violence. You have to shoot somebody, burn yourself alive, do something violent in order to get any attention at all, however good your cause or causes, however patient you have been, however well you have put your case. There is an absolute stone wall of indifference all over the world.\\\"\n223.\tMy Government will consider carefully all proposals that are put forward as part of the world Organization's effort to end or contain international terrorism. But it is against this stone wall of indifference to the pleas for justice from the oppressed and the dispossessed that we would like to see the most vigorous efforts of the United Nations directed.\n224.\tThe*General Assembly must view this question of terrorism with a sense of historical perspective. While the world Organization has a duty to use the peace-keeping machinery at its disposal to deal with all forms of violence, including international terrorism, it must be realized that this phenomenon is not new; it has only been brought closer home because a world which had accepted violence and terror as the natural lot of the poor, the weak and the oppressed, is shocked to see these evils applied to the rich qjid the successful. And where shall we place terrorism in relation to violent conflict as a whole?\n225.\tThe difficulties inherent in defining terrorism can be seen if one considers the war in Viet-Nam. That is an undeclared war; a war in which hundreds of thousands of Viet-Namese people have been killed or rendered homeless; a war in which a small country has received, at the hands of a great Power, twice the destructive force of all the bombing that took place in every theater of the Second World War; a war in which the senseless killing, bombing and destruction of human life and national resources go on without any end in sight. And for what purpose? For aims which in their origin were as confused as they were mistaken and which, even if they had ever had any validity, have been rendered completely meaningless by the political developments and events of our times.\n226.\tThat is no, just the judgment of one small African State; it is the judgment of the majority of the nations of the world. It is the judgment of the majority of the American people. When we consider the innocent human lives that have been destroyed or damaged by so-called terrorism, let us consider also the innocent millions of the civilian population of Viet-Nam.\n227.\tThe American-made gravel bomb that killed one diplomat was designed to kill, and has killed, countless VietNamese people-civilian and military alike. Is it more terrible when one such bomb is delivered by mail than when hundreds are delivered by military aircraft? Do the families of those unknown people killed by anti-personnel bombs in Viet-Nam grieve less for their loved ones than the family of someone with a more exalted status? One would think so, judging by the outcry in one case and the bored acceptance in the other. In the view of my Government, the terrorism that is being directed towards the whole VietNamese people is the one that should have the highest priority for concern by the membership of the United Nations.\n228.\tAnother unsatisfactory international situation is the manner in which the United Nations continues to be involved in the Korean question. My Government is disappointed that a viewpoint based on outmoded cold-war concepts has prevailed and has once again succeeded in preventing the long-overdue debate on the Korean question. The main reason for the success of the effort to prevent the debate was the misrepresentation of the issue. It was made to appear that such a debate would interfere with the movement towards a detente which is taking place between North and South Korea, when nothing could have been further from the case.\n229.\tThe Algerian proposal [A/8752] -which was supported by my delegation-had as its aim the \\\"Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea\\\", and was concerned primarily with United Nations involvement in that country. It was an effort to complement-not to inhibit or interfere with-the negotiations being carried out between the Governments of North and South Korea.\n230.\tMy Government has always maintained that the question of unification and all other internal questions can be decided only by the Korean people themselves. This is precisely why we feel that there must be a drastic review of the role of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabitation of Korea [UNCURK] and why the anomaly of a United States force in South Korea under the banner of the United Nations should be ended. The incongruity of the continued presence of that force- which is supposed to protect the independence of South Korea-is illustrated by the fact that South Korea is itself so self-sufficient, militarily speaking, that it has been able to send divisions of troops to Viet-Nam to oppose the liberation forces of that country.\n231.\tIt is factors such as these which hinder the reunification of Korea not a consideration of those steps which must be taken to put the United Nations in a proper relationship with the Korean people. It would have been particularly appropriate if steps had been initiated at the present time when there have not only been talks between Red Cross officials of the two Governments but also when they have taken the important step of declaring the principles on the basis of which they intend to proceed towards unification. It is particularly noteworthy that one of these principles is the desire to avoid all foreign interference or intervention by foreign forces.\n232.\tThe normalization of United Nations relations with Korea by the removal of the forces which remain there in the name of the Organization would undoubtedly hasten the process whereby old patterns of hostility would finally be eroded.\n233.\tIf the weakness of the United Nations is that it has so far made very slow progress in effecting the acceptance of new norms of morality and law in international politics, its strength is that it has been quietly and steadily promoting the concept of global co-operation in other fields. The achievements of such examples of international co-operation and planning as the third session of UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment may have fallen short of the goals set, but they are immensely valuable as exercises in the kind of co-operation that must eventually prevail in our interdependent world.\n234.\tThere is an increasing awareness of the fact that we, the nations of the world, are all partners in the business of planetary survival. One of the serious concerns of today which strongly necessitates a global view is the question of population, and my Government welcomes the increasing involvement of the United Nations in this area. We note also the rapid growth of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the expansion of its assistance in population matters to over 70 countries. Every support should be given to the Fund to enable it to respond to all requests from countries embarking upon serious population programs. Although not yet supported by the entire United Nations membership, the Fund has adopted guidelines which we regard as entirely correct in that it grants assistance only at the request of Governments and it does not advocate any particular approach to the solution of population problems.\n235.\tIt is often repeated that closing the gap between the rich and the developing nations is one of the ways in which international security can be strengthened. While this is yet another area where there is still a wide distance between practice and principle, yet the United Nations has set up and continues to devise machinery for closing the economic gap. What is necessary, in economic as in so many political problems, is the will to work for the goals set by the Organization\u2014the will, for example, of the developed countries to implement the decisions taken at the third session of UNCTAD and to increase the scope of those decisions which still do not give the developing countries the equitable trading conditions necessary for economic growth and economic independence.\n236.\tIn this same context, my Government will give its support to the establishment of a revolving fund for research into, and development of, the natural resources of developing countries. The majority of the third world countries have rejected direct financial aid as a primary source of national development and seek to establish national self-sufficiency. This can best be done by the development of their natural resources. My Government hopes that when the question of the revolving fund is discussed in the Economic and Social Council it will be seen in its proper perspective: as part of the process of strengthening international peace and security through the building of economically stable societies.\n237.\tWe see that task not only in the perspective of self-interest but also from the point of view that a State must put its own house in order if it is to meet its international obligations successfully. Under-developed countries like my own are beset by a multitude of problems, chief among which are the colonial legacies of illogical geographic or ethnic boundaries; economies hobbled by restricted trade and communication patterns; non-existent or sketchily built infrastructures; and alien political and cultural traditions. Since independence, most of us have struggled through a period of continued dependence on the aid, methods and cultural impositions of the former colonial Powers. As pioneered by the leader of our own revolution, Jaalle Mohamed Siad Barre, we in the Somali Democratic Republic are going on now to the development of national pride, to the encouragement of dependence on our own resources and to the arousing in all the people of national identity and purpose. It is my firm belief that this kind of national approach, this kind of reconstruction, is an essential basis for the carrying out of international obligations which all Member States of the United Nations have assumed.\n238.\tIn conclusion, I should like to reject, on behalf of my Government, a current view that the political issues which threaten international peace are better reserved for the so-called realities of super-Power politics, and that the United Nations would do better to confine itself mainly to the social and economic aspects of international co-operation. While most of us, and particularly those of us who are developing countries, have benefited, and continue to benefit, from the work of the United Nations agencies, while we are grateful for the campaigns to eradicate malaria and illiteracy, it seems obvious to my Government that the surest guarantee for the enjoyment of those benefits is a United Nations which is geared to preserve international peace and security, and whose Members, large and small, accept the rule of law as set forth in the Charter. That document, after all, has shown itself to be a durable and flexible instrument. It is capable of providing the basis for action in all the great issues of our times and of the foreseeable future, whether those issues are regional or global, political or humanitarian, social or scientific. The Charter's full potential must be developed to meet the needs of our complex and interdependent world.\n"

We are certain that your election to that high office reflects the confidence of the General Assembly in your personal qualities and the high esteem in which it holds the Polish People's Republic, which is bound to my country by friendly relations.\n2.\tI wish, Mr. President, to express my delegation's appreciation to your distinguished predecessor, Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, for the brilliant role he played in presiding over the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n3.\tI wish also, with great satisfaction and pleasure, to convey on behalf of my Government and delegation-sincere congratulations to Mr. Kurt Waldheim on his election to the high office of Secretary-General and to wish him success in the arduous tasks of that distinguished post.\n4.\tThe restoration to the People's Republic of China of its lawful rights in the United Nations is in our view an important event and a turning-point in the history of this Organization in its march towards a brighter future. My delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at this important step taken at the last session of the General Assembly. My country considers the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations a victory for the third world and for the United Nations itself.\n5.\tThe twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held in circumstances which require our closest attention and consideration. It is witnessing a series of events which demand our thorough study and require deeper understanding of their dimensions.\n6.\tOn the one hand, we are witnessing in the third world an overwhelming revolution against exploitation, injustice and official terrorism. We see that the peoples of the countries of the third world have chosen the road of violent struggle in order to regain their legitimate rights because of the inability of the United Nations to bring them justice and because of the failure of international law-which seems to have been made to safeguard the status quo to protect them and their legitimate\\\" rights.\n7.\tOn the other hand, we are witnessing a rapprochement between East and West, and we note that the tension which dominated Europe is being dissipated and replaced by a new phenomenon characterized by detente and common interests. Although my Government and my country welcome that phenomenon, which undoubtedly encourages us to be optimistic about the future of peace, in Europe in particular, and about relations between the two traditional camps in general, it should be viewed in a much wider context, because peace is one and indivisible. Consequently, any rapprochement or detente between East and West will not be fruitful unless it is extended to the other parts of the world.\n8.\tFurthermore, peace cannot be real and effective so long as the industrialized countries and the developing countries are separated by a wide gap, which is becoming even wider every year. The United Nations will not achieve success in its march towards peace and progress unless the industrialized countries adopt a policy of sincere co-operation with the United Nations in its efforts to put an end to exploitation afflicting the developing countries.\n9.\tWe cannot but view with concern the Second United Nations Development Decade declared by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session in 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)], for the experiences and unsatisfactory results of the first Development Decade are still fresh in our minds. In our opinion, the proper organs of the United Nations should locate those areas of weakness that led to the failure of the first Development Decade. At the same time, we reaffirm our demand for co-operation by the industrialized countries with United Nations efforts to achieve the objectives of the Second Development Decade.\n10.\tWe recognize that the responsibility for development rests primarily with the developing countries. The industrialized countries, however, should in our view assume a \npart of that responsibility. They are duty-bound to provide technical advice and assistance and to participate with all seriousness, sincerity and objectivity in United Nations programs in the developing countries.\n11.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic, which is one of 25 countries identified by the United Nations Committee for Development Planning as the \\\"hard core\\\" among the developing countries, is now determined to mobilize all its human and material resources and potential to face the challenge represented by the responsibility of economic development. We believe that through co-operation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as through bilateral agreements, we shall be able to overcome the problems of development in particular, poverty and unemployment.\n12.\tGeneral Assembly resolution 2768 (XXVI) was the outcome of many studies and reports. We think that the proper organs-in particular, the Office of the UnderSecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and the United Nations Development Program should direct their efforts to translate into action the existing proposals and suggested solutions. Moreover, we think that the United Nations should carefully adopt a development program for the developing countries based on the guidelines suggested by previous reports and studies regarding the under-developed countries, as is the case of the United Nations Volunteers program, which in its initial stage has proved effective and successful. The industrialized countries should also be called upon to give their financial assistance and technical know-how to make that pro-gramme more useful and effective.\n13.\tThe third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Santiago, Chile, early this year, was important to the developing countries, especially in view of the international monetary crisis facing the world, and its implications. The session highlighted the need for the developing countries to take collective action in order to protect their interests. Some industrialized Powers have attempted to solve the monetary problem by placing restrictions on their trade with the developing countries in order to maintain their exploitation and domination, and have tried to shift the burden of the problem to the small countries.\n14.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June of this year, was an attempt to overcome the problem of pollution. If nothing else, that Conference was an expression of the increasing awareness of the danger of pollution and has put responsibility for this problem at the doorstep of the industrialized countries.\n15.\tThe delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic supports the resolutions adopted by the two aforementioned conferences in Santiago and Stockholm and calls on all countries to co-operate with the United Nations in the implementation of those resolutions and recommendations. We also request the United Nations, together with the industrialized countries, to respond to the appeals made by the Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries held in Georgetown, Guyana in August, regarding the right of developing countries to full sovereignty over their natural resources in order to consolidate their economic and political independence.\n16.\tIf the Yemen Arab Republic attaches great importance to the United Nations in the field of development, it attaches even greater importance to the role of this Organization as an instrument of peace, justice and progress. We consider the Charter to be a program of clear principles and objectives. Hence, Yemen's.support for the United Nations and the principles enshrined in the Charter is a result of the Yemeni people's belief in those principles and objectives and their deep conviction that the United Nations will remain the only way to spare the world and succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Therefore, our people believes that it is a sacred duty of all Members of this Organization to uphold and strengthen the United Nations and to respect its Charter.\n17.\tIf and when a very few States, in violation of their obligations under the Charter, persist in defying and ignoring United Nations principles, the entire membership of the Organization is called upon to raise its voice and declare its condemnation.\n18.\tThere are many problems requiring speedy and decisive action by the United Nations. They are the problems of colonialism, neo-colonialism, apartheid, racial discrimination in Africa, and the continuing wars of aggression in the Middle East and VietNam. The delegation of Yemen wishes to present its views regarding these problems, which threaten international peace and security and are of great concern to world public opinion. As we discuss these problems, we deem it necessary to reiterate our total support for the resolutions of the United Nations in fulfillment of our obligations under the Charter and in expression of our concern to uphold the United Nations and the principles it represents.\n19.\tIt is our sacred duty to affirm again the need to restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate rights in conformity with international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter. The people of Palestine have been expelled from their homeland and have been deprived of their possessions and property. The people of Palestine are now dispersed throughout the world, or are living in tents on the charitable contributions provided through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The expulsion and murder of the Palestinian people at the hands of the neo-Nazis in Palestine are unparalleled in human history. Indeed, they dwarf the crimes perpetrated by the German Nazis in the first half of this century.\n20.\tEvents and developments now taking place in the Middle East confirm beyond any doubt that world Zionism, represented by the ruling clique of Tel Aviv, rejects any peace based on right and justice and refuses to respond to repeated appeals of the United Nations concerning the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and repatriation. World Zionism also refuses to withdraw from the territories of Egypt, Syria and Jordan it has occupied by force and war following the treacherous aggression against those Arab countries in June 1967.\n21.\tWe believe in peace, but we also believe that the only way to achieve it is to remove all conditions of injustice to which the Palestinian people have been subjected. Therefore we maintain that any solution of this problem will not be successful unless it expressly provides for the complete recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, the principles of international law and the practice of civilized societies. The Yemen delegation warns against any minimization of the rights of the Palestinian people, for this would only result in the escalation of the state of tension and chaos in the region, which would inevitably lead to a large-scale confrontation.\n22.\tIf the Zionists believe that the policy of violence and terror they practice against the Palestinian people in particular and the Arab nation in general is the only way of coexistence, then they should be made to realize that they are gambling with their own existence and exposing the world to unnecessary war.\n23.\tAs long as the Zionists continue to ignore the United Nations resolutions, the Charter and principles of human rights, as long as they continue their aggression against the Arab countries, as long as they continue to deny the Palestinian people their legitimate rights to their homes and self-determination, peace will never come to the Middle East.\n24.\tMy delegation maintains and even warns this Assembly that Israel alone is responsible for the deterioration of the situation because of its continued aggression against Arab countries, its repeated attacks against Lebanese and Syrian territories and its continued acts of terrorism and murder.\n25.\tAnother problem disturbing the human conscience and threatening peace and security is the war of aggression in Viet-Nam and all IndoChina. Our delegation declares its total support for the struggle carried out by the heroic VietNamese people to free their country from foreign forces and calls upon the United Nations to take a firm stand with regard to this problem. The Government of Yemen is convinced that the only way to reach a just and reasonable solution of this thorny problem is the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Viet-Nam, thus allowing the Vietnamese to exercise their right to self-determination in full freedom and in a manner of their own choice, without any outside interference or external pres-sure. Therefore our delegation demands the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from South Viet-Nam and calls upon the States concerned to respect the fight of the Vietnamese people to self-determination.\n26.\tMy delegation and my Government express their satisfaction with the recent developments in the Korean peninsula. We welcome the dialog which has been conducted between the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of South Korea. We also welcome the steps taken by the Red Cross societies in the two parts of Korea.\n27.\tIt is our conviction that the General Assembly should have taken up the Korean problem at this session and discussed it in the light of these new developments in the peninsula. In our opinion, the least the General Assembly should have done at this juncture was to adopt a resolution endorsing the positive steps taken thus far, calling for more efforts and declaring the removal of the United Nations flag, which is still at this moment flying over the helmets of the foreign occupying forces in South Korea.\n28.\tWe wish to reiterate here that the reunification of Korea is the responsibility solely of the Korean people, who must be given the freedom to decide their own destiny. This, we believe, cannot be accomplished unless the foreign occupation forces in South Korea are withdrawn. The existence of those troops constitutes the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of the country and the prevalence of brotherhood and understanding between the two countries.\n29.\tThe position of the Government of the Yemen Arab Republic with regard to the issue of colonialism is well known. We wish to confirm again our support of the National Liberation Movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) under the leadership of FRELIMO. We call upon the United Nations to take a firm stand vis-a-vis the Government of Lisbon with regard to its continued flouting of United .Nations resolutions and its defiance of world opinion represented by this Organization. We realize that Portugal alone could not continue its colonial war against the nationalists in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). It is with the material and military assistance offered by some States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Portugal has been able to defy the United Nations and continue its criminal war against the African nationalists in those areas.\n30.\tWhen we discuss colonialism and its crimes we are forced to discuss racial discrimination and apartheid practiced by the Government of the white minority of South Africa against the people of Namibia. Our Organization has already adopted several resolutions regarding the colonial situation in Namibia, the most important being the resolution, adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-first session in 1966, which terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia [resolution 2145 (XXI)]. The racist Government in Pretoria does not recognize the competence of the United Nations and therefore refuses to implement the resolutions regarding Namibia. We cannot accept that attitude. Our loyalty to the principles of the United Nations and its Charter and our strong desire to strengthen the position of this Organization compel us to demand the imposition of sanctions against South Africa in accordance with Articles 6,41 and 42 of the Charter.\n31.\tThe list is still incomplete, for there is still the problem of the people of Zimbabwe, who live under the racial terror and the rule of the white minority in Southern Rhodesia. In November 1965, that transplanted racist minority declared unilateral independence. But what is the significance of that independence to the African nationals, who represent the majority of the population of Rhodesia? It means the continuation of colonialism and the loathsome exploitation of the material and human resources of that country for the benefit of a foreign racist group.\n32.\tWhat is happening in Southern Rhodesia resembles and parallels what is taking place in occupied Palestine.\nBritish colonialism is alone responsible for the crimes being perpetrated now in both Palestine and Rhodesia. Britain withdrew from Palestine, which was under its Mandate, and left it prey to a foreign racist clique. The same barbaric operation has been repeated in Rhodesia, where Britain has refused since 1947 to submit information on that Territory to the United Nations, insisting that Rhodesia does not fall within the scope of Chapter XI of the Charter. Moreover, it has given the white racist minority in that area the freedom to control and exploit the resources of the Zimbabwe people and to repress their right to independence and freedom. The mutilation and violation of the most elementary principles and laws that is being witnessed by humanity are but one aspect of colonialism, whose crimes would make the devil appear to be a saint.\n33.\tWe demand the overthrow of the illegal and racist regime of Ian Smith and we support the struggle of the Zimbabwe people for freedom and independence. We support all liberation movements which aim at establishing a national rule supported by the majority of the people.\n34.\tYemen, a small country whose people have struggled throughout history and have made innumerable sacrifices in order to preserve their freedom and independence and their right to self-determination, well knows the meaning of struggle and the high price it exacts. Therefore it has deep compassion for those who are still deprived of their basic human rights. We call on the United Nations and all freedom and peace-loving nations to come to the assistance of these struggling peoples and to extend to them all possible aid, for humanity will never be free as long as there is one single human being enslaved, and there will be no peace on earth as long as there is one single people, however small or weak, deprived of its right to self-determination in its homeland.\n35.\tThe voices of condemnation which we began to hear against the freedom fighters, some of which were pronounced from this rostrum in an attempt to equate struggle with terrorism, were neither new nor strange to the history of struggle. The same charges were leveled against the comrades of Cromwell and Washington, against the comrades of the Paris communes, against the comrades of Simon Bolivar and Garibaldi, against the heroes of the French resistance, against the comrades of Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, against the freedom fighters in Algeria and all Africa, and against the many, many others in the long list of heroes throughout the history of human struggle for freedom. That did not discourage the freedom fighters nor dissuade them from their march along the arduous path to freedom. As we go through the last third of this century, it is our duty to stand beside those fighters and help them regain their legitimate rights. It is the duty of the United Nations to play an essential role in this respect.\n36.\tTerrorists are those who blow up houses over the heads of their inhabitants as the Zionist State does in occupied Palestine. Terrorists are those who suppress the freedom of man in Namibia, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea (Bissau) and Rhodesia.\n37.\tSome States have officially practiced and continue to practice terrorism and violence against innocent people. The indiscriminate bombing in IndoChina, the crimes committed by the authorities of Salisbury, Pretoria and Lisbon against the African nationals represent the worst of terrorism and enrage the human conscience. The Zionist State in Palestine was established by terrorism and continues to live by terrorism. The crimes perpetrated by the Zionists against the Palestinian and neighboring Arabs, day after day and year after year, make the Zionists the indisputable masters of terrorism.\n38.\tIf the United Nations is to take upon itself the responsibility for addressing itself to the problem of terrorism, it must start by identifying and eliminating the sources of terrorism: the practices of imperialists, colonialists and the transplanted racist minorities directed against the peoples of the third world in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n39.\tThe responsibility of the United Nations is enormous and the Organization should assert its moral and political authority. Believing, as we do, in the United Nations, we implore that it keep in tune with the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world for freedom, justice and progress. We believe that the Member States, and especially the big Powers, are responsible for protecting peace and upholding the authority of the United Nations as an instrument of freedom, peace, justice and progress. Unless Member States co-operate in fulfillment of their obligations under the Charter, the future of this Organization is in danger.\n40.\tWe believe in the United Nations and its principles. We believe that it is the only instrument able to promote peace, freedom and progress in this world. We believe that it is the true expression of peoples' hopes and aspirations everywhere. Yemen, as a developing nation and as part of the third world, has a vested interest in a strong and effective United Nations. We will continue to uphold the principles of the Charter and give all our support to its endeavor to translate these principles into living realities.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is for me a pleasant duty to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your long experience in the service of your country, as well as your sterling qualities as a statesman and a diplomat, eminently qualify you to discharge effectively the duties attendant upon your high office. The record of your service since the opening of this session has already justified the confidence reposed in you by the Members of our Organization.\n99.\tI want also to place on record the Nigerian delegation's appreciation of the services rendered as President of the Assembly during the last year by Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, whose occupancy of the presidential chair not only did great credit to his own country but also enhanced Afro-Asian co-operation in tackling very explosive world crises and delicate situations in the General Assembly.\n100.\tPermit me further to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on the energetic and efficient manner in which he has started to grapple with the heavy burden of his office.\n101.\tSince the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly there have been some positive trends towards an improvement in the world situation. The era of detente, which was ushered in by increased contact between the super-Powers, is gradually lessening international tensions; the balance of terror which had formed the basis of the uneasy peace between these super-Powers and their allies is gradually giving place to a reconciliation of interests. The People's Republic of China, following the historic decision taken by the General Assembly last year [resolution 2758(XXVI)], has assumed its legitimate place in the community of nations and its representative had the opportunity, only last month, of presiding over the most important organ of the United Nations, the Security Council. These developments, by reducing the dangers of global war, have made significant contributions to the maintenance of world peace and security, and the realization of the purposes and principles of the Organization.\n102.\tHowever, we cannot pretend to be unaware of some of the problems which detente may create if we do not consciously guard against them. There will increasingly arise the tendency on the part of a few to see themselves as the sole arbiters of international peace and security and to seek solutions outside the United Nations to world problems which affect us all, great and small alike.\n103.\tWhile the recent Moscow agreements, for instance, have been hailed as a positive step towards disarmament, there is no denying that their significance would have been even greater had they been worked out within the United Nations Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. We realize, of course, that even within that Committee the necessity for \\\"political realism\\\", to quote a common phrase, is increasingly being invoked as a justification for special privileges for some members, thus restricting the role of others.\n104.\tThe small, the medium-sized and the developing countries as a whole must seek active participation in the development of a world order in which all countries will be secure, and the interests of all peoples safeguarded. For us in Africa, the improvement in the world situation will be more meaningful if and when it brings the wind of change to the colonial and racial situation in Southern Africa. As far back as 1960, this Organization, by its resolution 1514 (XV), committed itself to the total liberation of colonial Territories and the granting of self-determination to their peoples. Twelve years after this lofty commitment, and in spite of improvements in other areas of international concern, it is most regrettable that the situation in southern Africa has not changed.\n105.\tThe colonialist and minority regimes, firmly backed by some NATO powers and international capitalism, continue to suppress African freedom movements savagely, to ignore United Nations resolutions, and to promote subversion against countries which support the freedom movements.\n106.\tThe question of colonialism affects Africa more than any other part of the world, and the continued existence of colonialism in Africa is an infraction of our dignity as Africans and a threat to our national security and sovereignty. That is why we in Africa have had to take a lead in concerting international efforts against colonialism where-ever it exists and in giving substantial material and moral assistance to freedom movements.\n107.\tTo us, therefore, it is a matter of great disappointment that the dedication to the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) shown by the OAU has not been matched by whole-hearted support of it by some Members of the United Nations, because of their mistaken belief that their national interests would be adversely affected by the total implementation of that resolution. For example, only a few days ago, on Friday, 29 September 1972, we witnessed a deplorable use of the veto by the United Kingdom to thwart the rightful aspirations of the peoples of Zimbabwe to independence and self-determination and to promote the selfish interests of the racist minority regime in that country.\n108.\tIf we are all committed to the liberation of peoples everywhere from the indignity implicit in colonialism and racism, we ought to be prepared to back our verbal commitments with material assistance. In this respect I must express Nigeria's sincere appreciation of the commitment of the foreign ministers of the non-aligned States to increase their material assistance to the liberation movements.\n109.\tI should also draw attention with great appreciation to the decision of the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic countries to provide material assistance to those liberation movements. These offers of assistance, which positively demonstrate the support for human dignity given by the\nNordic peoples, as well as the non-aligned States, strengthen the determination of the freedom fighters. A tribute must also be paid to the socialist countries for the assistance they have continuously given to the cause of liberation in Africa.\n110.\tWhat is required is that assistance be given on such a massive scale as to remove without further delay the forces of oppression and racism from the Territories of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Zimbabwe and Namibia. For so long as the situation in those Territories remains as it is today so long as the peoples of those Territories are denied the opportunity to exercise their rights to independence and self-determination-there will remain an indelible blot on the record of the United Nations.\n111.\tJust as disheartening as the lack of progress in decolonization is the continuation of the deplorable policy of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. In spite of the innumerable resolutions of this Organization, the South African Government has not relented in its pursuit of its racist policy. On the contrary, it has extended that policy more harshly to every aspect of national life in that country. Only recently the Prime Minister of South Africa embarked upon a program designed to cause confusion among black African countries and other mixed societies by advocating dialog with independent black African countries and by increasing facilities for black artists, sportsmen and other personalities to visit South Africa from the United States and similar countries. Even that feeble and insincere concession to world opinion has received a severe set-back through the increasing opposition of the ultra- racist, Fascist wing of his party. The continued failure of the moderate and liberal-minded section of the South African community to secure influential positions in the public life of that country is an indication that no amount of dialog or fraternization will deflect the obscurantist and inflexible advocates of apartheid from their course aimed at the total dehumanization of black people in that country and beyond. For we notice that the South African Government is now exporting apartheid to Zimbabwe, Namibia and the African Territories of Angola and Mozambique, which are still under Portuguese colonial domination.\n112.\tAfraid that independent African countries north of the Zambezi river might become stable, developed and powerful, and thereby disprove the racist white-superiority concept which underpins the policy of apartheid, and concerned that such countries total abhorrence of the policy of apartheid would increasingly contribute to the overturn of the status quo in South Africa, the South African Government has now mounted a program of action designed to create and promote conspiracies, subversion and sabotage in several independent African countries.\n113.\tDuring this session of the General Assembly the United Nations must look closely into areas in which new initiatives can be taken in the efforts to combat apartheid. It is no longer enough to condemn apartheid as being a crime against humanity. It is imperative that we organize more effectively and efficiently our resources to combat this curse to humanity. A start should be made in the more effective and efficient co-ordination of our multifarious activities against apartheid.\n114.\tI wish to emphasize, as I have on other occasions, the point that Nigeria's policy towards the regimes in southern Africa is not based on racial considerations. It is motivated principally by our firm conviction that all men have the right to freedom and to economic and social justice. Apartheid is to us an abominable and repugnant State policy. If it were imposed on any other race in the world we should condemn it in equally strong terms. Above all our attitude is determined by our awareness that the entrenchment of racialist minority Governments in southern Africa is not only morally wrong but, more importantly, a threat to the sovereignty and security of independent African States and a primary source of international conflict.\n115.\tThe hope for bridging the economic gap between the developed and the developing countries which inspired the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], has not been borne out. It will be recalled that one of the basic assumptions of the Strategy is the existence in the developed countries of the political will necessary for the implementation of the measures expected of them in the Strategy.\n116.\tThe third session of UNCTAD, held in Santiago, Chile, earlier this year, provided the first opportunity to put to the test the existence or otherwise of this political will on the part of the developed countries. No one who attended that session had any doubt that the bottom had been knocked out of the Strategy. The reluctance of the developed countries to meet even the minimum requirements of the developing countries, as set out in the Declaration adopted at the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 developing countries at Lima on 7 November 1971,  was clearly shown on almost every problem discussed at the session. In the face of this apathy on the part of the advanced countries towards taking the basic step in the implementation of a Strategy which was carefully and elaborately worked out, can we in the third world continue to entrust our economic fortunes to others? It is the view of Nigeria that this situation calls for closer co-operation and deeper consultations among the developing countries to determine what their economic and trade relations with the developed countries should be. To append ourselves to economic units created basically for the development of Europe, for instance, cannot serve the long-term interest of countries on other continents struggling to find their feet. This is why Nigeria is committed to the promotion of regional economic units in Africa which would provide the much-needed co-operation for the rapid development of the continent. The All-Africa Trade Fair held in Nairobi, Kenya, early this year demonstrated the vast potentialities of intra-African trade. But let me hasten to add that Nigeria hopes that the development of regional economic groups will promote, rather than restrict, a free flow of goods and services among all countries.\n117.\tThe issues relating to the law of the sea are bound to assume great proportions during this session of the General Assembly in view of our decision at the twenty-fifth session to convene a conference on the law of the sea in 1973 [resolution 2750 C (XXV)]. Naturally, as a coastal State and as a developing country, Nigeria has a special interest in the proposed conference for two reasons: first is the question of our security; second is the link between the exploitation of the resources of the sea and of the sea-bed and our economic development. Not having participated in the First and Second Conferences on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 respectively, Nigeria will want to take this opportunity to ensure that its vital interests are protected even while helping to facilitate international commerce and scientific research for the peaceful exploitation of the sea-bed. It is, therefore, my view that the time spent by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction in preparing an exhaustive list of subjects for discussion at the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea has not been wasted. It is a matter for discussion whether in fact sufficient preparatory work will have been done by the end of this year to enable us to convene the conference as scheduled, if we are to avoid the fiasco of the 1960 Conference. Patience and careful planning are indispensable to achieving our aim of elaborating generally acceptable regimes for the sea.\n118.\tJust as the Charter of the United Nations is in principle based on the sovereign equality of all its Members, so also must membership in the Security Council and other committees of the United Nations be based on principles which recognize and accommodate ever-changing world attitudes. As the membership of the Organization has increased more than twofold since its inception, it is necessary, in the view of my Government, to readjust the composition of the principal organ concerned with peace and security; for there is no denying the fact that the effectiveness of the Security Council in fulfilling its role cannot be disassociated from its representative character. It is arguable whether or not it is wise in present-day circumstances to continue to maintain a privileged position for those countries which in accordance with Article 23, paragraph 1, of the Charter have permanent seats on the Council and exercise a veto power over its decisions. Basically, the conditions prevalent at the time of the designation of those permanent members no longer apply today, and democratization of our Organization should ideally apply to the Security Council as well. Bearing in mind, however, the present climate of opinion among those permanent members, whose concurrence is necessary for withdrawing their privileges, it may be more realistic to think in terms of the expansion of the system of permanent membership to include representatives from those regions in the world which are at present excluded from permanent membership: for instance, Asia, Africa and Latin America. In any case, Nigeria believes that the need exists for some modest increase in the over-all membership of the Security Council to provide fairer representation of the various geographical regions in our Organization.\n119.\tThe situation in the Middle East continues to be ominous and confused. Various attempts and encouraging movements towards a peaceful solution, or negotiations and contacts with a view to seeking areas of possible accommodation in the interest of peace, continue to be frustrated by the intransigence of some of the parties to the dispute, and their encouragement, for narrow selfish reasons, by some of the big Powers supporting various interests and nations in the area. For us in Nigeria, Security Council resolution 242(1967) still represents the best basis for movement towards settlement and a lasting and just peace in the area.\n120.\tThe initiative taken last year by the OAU, in which my Head of State participated, was to assist in the attainment of this objective. The OAU's inability to record complete success was due, in my opinion, to the legalistic interpretation by the parties of the wording of Security Council resolution 242(1967). May we on this occasion appeal to the parties to take another conciliatory look at that resolution, for it takes full account of the interests of all the parties to this tragic dispute? It is essential that all parties in the area commit themselves to a peaceful settlement.\n121.\tThe issue of terrorism, which has loomed so large during the current session, should be seen in its proper perspective. The unfortunate impression has been created, particularly by the Western press, that Arab and African States are opposed to a discussion of the issue, which, we are told by the supporters of the item [item 92], has created panic in the minds of a section of the international community. Yet, it is now clear, after the preliminary exchange of views, both in the General Committee and in plenary meetings, that the hesitation expressed on the need for a clear definition of the term \\\"terrorism\\\" in the context in which it is to be discussed is wholly justified. For, if not put in its proper context, the discussion can easily degenerate into a total condemnation of the means of implementing principles which are enshrined in the Charter and have been reiterated in innumerable decisions and resolutions of this Organization.\n122.\tNo responsible Government or person would condone acts perpetrated by individuals against innocent persons for their own personal gain or for emotional satisfaction. However, we are painfully aware that, in pursuance of ideals enshrined in our Charter, it has become necessary for some persons and organizations to adopt violent methods where all avenues of peaceful settlement have been barred. The exercise of self-determination and independence has been recognized by the United Nations as the inalienable right of all peoples. Yet we see these rights being denied to millions of people in southern Africa by the reign of terror imposed on them by colonialist and racialist regimes. If such peoples resort to armed force, Nigeria cannot be party to a discussion that will seek to equate their activities with those of common criminals who hijack planes and kidnap diplomats and other important people to extort financial benefits for themselves. Certainly, we in Africa, who have endured the most vicious forms of terrorism, have no inhibition in exposing to the world what some of our brothers still suffer. What we cannot condone is to give those who organize the worst forms of terror an opportunity to condemn as terrorists the victims of their inhumanity. It must be made clear that peoples struggling to liberate themselves from oppression and exploitation have the right to use all methods at their disposal, including force. This fact has been recognized by our Organization. We should therefore not leave the door wide open for reactionary regimes to erode the glorious struggles of these peoples. In this regard we hope that the Sixth Committee, to which the item has now been referred, will give a clear definition that will be generally acceptable to Members of this Organization.\n123.\tI wish to conclude this statement by affirming our abiding faith in the ability of the United Nations to contribute to the consolidation of peace among all nations, to the enhancement of justice in all lands and to the promotion of the economic and social progress of all the peoples of the world. We, in Nigeria, shall continue to do all that we can to contribute to the improvement of the methods of the United Nations, in the hope that the Organization will decide to proceed with greater vigor to tackle its unfinished business: to assert the dignity of the human being and his right to self-determination and the enjoyment of freedom, to press forward the elimination of apartheid, to bring about the elimination of force as an instrument for settling disputes, and to concert international co-operation for the furtherance of the economic and social progress of peoples everywhere. This, we believe, will enhance the possibilities of the United Nations to flourish for the good of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity today to associate myself with the speakers who have preceded me in offering to you the warmest congratulations of my delegation and expressing to you our deep satisfaction at seeing an eminent representative of Eastern Europe, ardent defender, moreover, of the cause of oppressed peoples, presiding over the destinies of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n129.\tI also wish, in accordance with the traditions of equity of this august Assembly, to pay a tribute to Mr. Adam Malik for the tact and competence that he displayed during the work-which is now history-of the last session of the General Assembly, work to which he brought so much intelligence and nobility of spirit.\n130.\tTo our Secretary-General I wish to express the gratification of my delegation for his excellent introduction to the work of the present session. Since his election to his responsible post he has continued to show the measure of his authority and his competence in the face of the important affairs of a world in a constant state of flux.\n131.\tToday we are gathered in a climate which is propitious for fundamental changes, harbingers of a new era in international relations. The most striking illustration of this radical transformation in international order is surely to be found in the following significant events: the Sino-American rapprochement, which took the form of an official trip by President Nixon to China; the determination proclaimed by the Governments of Pyongyang and Seoul to promote the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea; the equally evident will of the two German States to modify their fundamental relationships; the prospect for detente in Indo-Pakistani relations as a result of the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 and subsequent talks; and the determination of Japan and China to normalize their relations.\n132.\tIt is nevertheless essential in this ever-changing world whose transformations are frequently beyond our understanding that we not let ourselves be carried away by the illusion of apparent security.\n133.\tIt is evident that the most cynical person would be unable to deliver a speech on the state of the world, which we are invited to do at the annual session of the General Assembly, without expressing a feeling of profound misgiving at the growing gap between the noble ideals set for itself by the international community and the melancholy reality. To ensure peace among States, to induce respect for the sovereignty of the weak against the strong through respect for international law, which is the guarantor of freedom for peoples and men: is that not a grandiose task in defense of which all countries should be mobilized?\n134.\tAnd yet what do we see from continent to continent? Everywhere conflicts are breaking out. Numerous bombings with their aftermath of iron, fire and blood still ravage various points on our planet. Millions of innocent victims are dressing their wounds when they are not weeping for their dead. Others continue to live in dreadful poverty, condemned, most frequently, to the darkness of colonial servitude.\n135.\tThese atrocities and I am not saying anything that is not already well known affect by some irony of fate the countries of the third world, those very countries which are trying to achieve stability and peace in order to ensure their material and moral development. Were we to stop to meditate on this depressing situation we would become bitterly aware of the nefarious role played in the world by selfishness and the Wish for power of one or the other of the great Powers even though they claim to belong to different ideologies.\n136.\tThat is why it is already high time to address an urgent appeal to all peoples and men of goodwill to join their energies and bend all their will towards the achievement of justice and peace in the world.\n137.\tIn formulating that wish I must turn my eyes towards the ancient continent of Asia, from which so many messages of peace emanated, but which today offers the distressing spectacle of one of the most horrible human tragedies: I refer to the War in IndoChina.\n138.\tThe VietNamese people, tragically torn asunder by a horrible fratricidal war of 20 years duration, have undeniably shown to South-East Asia a spirit of determination and sacrifice, until now unsuspected. Because their thirst for freedom and their refusal to capitulate has surely converted the VietNamese conflict into the martyrdom of an entire people, it appears to us that there, as elsewhere, negotiation remains the Only course towards a constructive peace, since it would be freely consented to. Without further delay the United Nations must echo the words of President Senghor, who stated recently:\n\\\"It is time for weapons to be silent in VietNam as well as in the Middle East so that a just and durable peace may come, based upon the self-determination of peoples, without foreign intervention.\\\"\nThis is the prior condition whose realization would make it possible for the Paris conference to embark resolutely upon a decisive course with increased chances of success.\n139.\tIt is also the moment for our Organization in this respect following the clearly expressed will of the George-town Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries to re-establish as a full pledged Member of the United Nations the regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, which not often is recognized by the majority of members of the international community but, above all, controls more than 85 per cent of the national territory, which to this day harbors more than 11 members of the Government.\n140.\tI do not doubt, in the light of events which have taken place recently, that we may at last be on the eve of seeing, if not an era of peace, at least a certain era of calm in South-East Asia, a region that has long been sorely tried.\n141.\tMay the hope for the Far East extend also to the Middle East. As President Senghor has indicated, the painful Israel-Arab struggle amounts to a fratricidal struggle between two branches of the great Semitic family, which has given to the world irreplaceable messages. Suddenly, the unprecedented actions of the \\\"10 wise men\\\" of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], with a view to Ambassador Jarring resuming negotiations, take on a special significance.\n142.\tUnfortunately, the policies of certain great Powers, which seem to accommodate themselves to the proposition of \\\"no peace, no war\\\" in the Middle East, seem, in all likelihood, to spell ultimate ruin for the efforts of the OAU. However, far from despairing of peace in the Middle East, the countries of the third world and also, and especially, the great Powers of the European Economic Community are duty-bound to redouble their efforts towards a prompt settlement of the conflict, a settlement which would be in accord with their interests, especially since the two belligerent Powers are associate members of the Common Market.\n143.\tJust as my Government has maintained and still maintains that there are truths and realities imposed by reason, and the existence of Israel is just such a reality, it is also convinced that the security of the Jewish State will not be ensured in the long run except through dialog and agreement with its Arab neighbors the latter having to realize that peace is more than ever necessary to their unity and development. It is therefore pertinent that the advent of peace to the area depends exclusively on a dialog between Moslems, Jews, Arabs and Bedouins.\n144.\tAccordingly, it is now for the United Nations to require that Israel establish the conditions necessary for such a dialog through strict compliance with and full application of the pertinent provisions of Security Council resolution 242(1967), and that it publicly declare at the same time its intention not to annex occupied Arab territories. That would be a decisive step for Israel that would lead to the negotiating table, Egypt no longer being able, at the risk of losing its territorial integrity and identity, to make any further concessions.\n145.\tIn referring to this gloomy picture of the Middle East we have to recall, in the case of international terrorism, which everybody agrees must be denounced as a threat to peace, that it is a constant truth that to be radical the eradication of any evil necessarily requires a thorough knowledge of its profound causes.\n146.\tTo my delegation it is important first of all to define clearly what is meant by the word \\\"terrorism\\\" and to study all its aspects, including the underlying motivations which engender terror throughout the world, before seeking to determine subsequently forceful measures that might eliminate it as a means of action in conflicts between States. I emphasize, moreover, that my country will oppose in the most categorical fashion any Initiative to put the slightest impediment in the way of the noble and just liberation movements that are operating on the African continent.\n147.\tThere is a problem of as much concern as that of the Middle East. I am referring to the problem of colonialism, which imperils peace and security throughout the world. Decolonization in other words, the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination constitutes, as we know, the most sacred foundation of the United Nations family. This is a fundamental rule an embodiment of the chief safeguard of human rights which, for every government worthy of the name, must guarantee the certainty of peace.\n148.\tHow, therefore, can we endure Africa's continuing to pay a heavy tribute to this phenomenon of decolonization? How can we endure that Portugal, South Africa and the illegal and racist regime in Southern Rhodesia continue with impunity to keep millions of human beings in the fetters of colonial oppression and thereby violate in the most flagrant way fundamental human rights?\n149.\tIn Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), Portugal, for the past 10 years, has been pursuing an archaic war of colonial reconquest. Although condemned many times by the Security Council following repeated complaints from African States bordering the Territories under Portuguese administration, the Lisbon authorities have nevertheless shown their determination to be sucked into the quicksand of armed aggression and provocation. In spite of everything my Government, which has welcomed 80,000 refugees from Guinea (Bissau) to its territory, would be prepared to believe that Portugal is not racist, but the logical conclusion of such an absence of prejudice would be, indeed, respect for and strict application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in resolution 1514 (XV).\n150.\tIn Southern Rhodesia the minority, illegal and racist regime is still in power seven years after the unilateral and illegal declaration of independence and two years after the proclamation of the no less illegal \\\"republic\\\". That rebel regime grows stronger every day in spite of the mandatory economic sanctions dictated by the United Nations, particularly by the Security Council. It is true that, contrary to expectations, those sanctions have not had a decisive effect on the economic situation in Southern Rhodesia and therefore do not seem capable of producing the expected political changes, bearing in mind the assistance that South Africa is giving to the rebel colony.\n151.\tOnly a few days ago, under the shallow pretext of the effect it was having on \\\"Olympic peace\\\", the blacks of all continents were unjustly made the object of vituperation worse, they were denied some of their victories in the competitions by a fierce coalition of whites of all convictions unable to accept the unanimous will of Africa to oppose Rhodesian participation in the Olympic Games. We must proclaim to all those who, under the cloak of political disinterestedness, continue to deny the valiant people of Zimbabwe its right to human dignity that it is precisely their unshakable readiness to recognize a white minority domination of millions of blacks that indubitably constitutes the most monstrous political act, since it is dictated solely by racist concerns.\n152.\tEveryone knows that what we are witnessing on the part of the illegal Ian Smith regime at present is a total and systematic rejection of all preexisting values and hence the acme of mental aberration demonstrated by its unrestrained and uncontrolled use of the one form of total non-existence available to man violent death.\n153.\tThat is why, following the recent resounding rejection by the people of the \\\"test of acceptability\\\" submitted by the Pearce Commission, it is essential, in order to put a final end to the Salisbury rebellion, to resort immediately to the sort of prompt and energetic action which so serious a situation demands, in conformity with Chapter VII of the Charter. It goes without saying that Great Britain, in view of its responsibility for that Territory, must give active support to such action by displaying henceforth greater authority and determination in the exercise of its prerogatives as administering Power.\n154.\tIn South Africa and this is obvious the measures prescribed by the United Nations have not been successful either in ending the fierce repression of the innocent population or in wiping out or eliminating apartheid, which is nothing but a complete ideology of rules and constraints erected by a white minority in order to dominate and exploit the Africans. It seems to me unnecessary to refer to the case of Namibia, whose Territory has been illegally occupied by the Government of South Africa for the past six years in defiance of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as the opinion of the International Court of Justice.\n155.\tBut there is something even more serious. For several years we have seen the strengthening of the Lisbon- Salisbury-Pretoria axis. The most salient features of the strengthening of that unholy alliance undoubtedly find their most sinister expression in the political, military and financial support which that trio of colonial oppressors is getting from certain members of NATO.\n156.\tNevertheless, the international crises of the moment should not cause us to overlook the agonizing question of economic under-development, which is the principal characteristic of three quarters of mankind. As President Senghor mentioned in his famous speech at the fifty-sixth session of the general conference of the International Labor Organization, \\\"a just and enduring world peace cannot be built on social injustice any more than on disregard of the ideals of the essential solidarity which must unite mankind\\\". \n157.\tFor the Chief of State of Senegal, among the problems which confront the third world, problems which are dialectically connected, there is one of capital importance and that is the problem of the deterioration of the terms of trade-of the more equitable distribution of the world's wealth, three quarters of which are unjustly confiscated by the rich nations for their own benefit.\n158.\t\\\"The imperialism of ideology\\\", to use the words of the most authoritative voice in Senegal, is precisely this economy of concerted domination practiced by the great Powers to the detriment of the developing countries.\n159.\tThat is why the year which has elapsed, far from revealing any favorable prospects, has on the contrary been a disappointment for the poor countries and thereby for the whole world. The clearest and most recent proof of this dramatic situation is undoubtedly the failure of the third session of UNCTAD held in Santiago, Chile.\n160.\tMy delegation has the deep-rooted belief that the failure in Santiago had only one cause-the total absence of political will among the wealthy countries. It is no longer a secret to anyone that, as was stated at the end of the work of the second session of UNCTAD by the eminent economist Raoul Prebisch: the developed countries, with a few exceptions, continue to consider the problem of development to be a secondary problem which can be solved here and there by means of a few inadequate measures and not by bold and resolute action.\n161.\tThe verdict on Santiago will have the rare merit of highlighting what, after all, has now become obvious to all. I am speaking of the refusal of the developed countries, be they capitalist or socialist, to accept precise commitments toward the third world.\n162.\tIndeed, no specific agreement can be achieved on improving the terms of development financing, extrication from over-indebtedness and the rules to be established to reduce the harm suffered by the developing countries as a result of the international monetary crisis. The major preoccupation of the Group of 77 developing countries with finding a solution to the tragic commodity crisis through the regulation of production and the stabilization of prices has hardly fared any better.\n163.\tAs regards the legitimate claims of the third world for partial disarmament to help development or even the establishment of an automatic link between special drawing rights and assistance to the third world, there again we are bound to record the negative-balance balance-sheet of the work of the third session of UNCTAD.\n164.\tHere we must refer to the appeal for human solidarity launched from this rostrum by the Prime Minister of Senegal on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:\n\\\"... in the present state of disharmony in the world, what better activity could the rich countries undertake than to promote the development of the poor countries? \\\" [1872nd meeting, para. 156.]\n165.\tAnd President Senghor reiterated forcefully:\n\\\"It is the duty and in the interests of the rich nations, in order to spare an anguished world a world war in which the proletarian countries, pushed to despair, will have nothing further to lose and nothing to hope for, to put into practice without delay a new strategy for the creation of a new system of trade which will be truly international-that is to say, more ecumenical-more human because more just. That strategy must be adequate for the planet and the universal civilization which we are building.\\\"\n166.\tDoes that mean that, faced with the distressing spectacle of impoverishment in the midst of abundance, we.\nthe have-not countries, are irremediably doomed to suffer the fate of Tantalus? Must we therefore give way to despair and seek refuge in total resignation? Of course not.\n167.\tMy delegation considers that the feelings of frustration born of the third session of UNCTAD must give way, for the rich and poor alike, to an attempt at objective thought and analysis in order to bring about genuine peace, genuine because it would be the fruit of freedom, harmonization and solidarity among all men in all continents.\n168.\tI can assure members that, to the reasons for discouragement systematically maintained by the rich countries, the poorer countries will respond with courage, an awareness that they must stick together in order to integrate their economies rationally within regional and subregional structures, such as the recent inception of the future economic community of West Africa, to the formation of which my country is proud to have made its modest contribution.\n169.\tSenegal remains confident in the great possibilities of the international community, which, properly combined, would contribute, sooner or later, to the establishment of a better world whose common denominator would be a fair and healthy distribution of wealth. We are all the more convinced of the truth of this, as it is not mere lip-service to tradition which makes us survey the gloomy panorama of the international situation in order to find in it some brighter spots which might notwithstanding provide, if not grounds for satisfaction, at least reasons for hope.\n170.\tIn the political and strategic field, the slight but nevertheless reassuring detente in international relations appears already as an encouraging sign. Suffice it for me simply to refer to the policy of contacts and negotiations practiced in Europe and concretely illustrated by the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. Moreover, my Government has not failed to interpret the resumption of Sino-American dialog and the Moscow agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union as the prelude to an era of peaceful coexistence between the three giants of this world.\n171.\tWith regard to decolonization, while little progress has been achieved, the meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa have nevertheless made it possible for our young countries to refer again, but on African soil, to the bulky file on colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid. Senegal is particularly gratified since, during the Rabat meeting the Heads of State and Government of the OAU resolved to increase considerably the budget of the Committee of Liberation, and to give priority to aid and effective support for the liberation movements.\n172.\tIn the economic and social fields my delegation takes note of the few positive decisions taken by UNCTAD at its third session: those concerning the idea of having developing countries participate in the reform of the monetary system and the special program of action to be launched for the benefit of the nucleus of the 25 least developed countries.\n173.\tI would add that it is first and foremost for the industrialized countries, which are those deriving the \nprincipal-I might say \\\"the exclusive\\\" benefit from the iniquitous rules governing the international economy, to shape the priority requirements of development to fit a world-wide context. In so doing they would respond to the appeal of the Prime Minister of Senegal, who said:\n\\\"No man should feel happy as long as a single man elsewhere is dying of hunger. No nation can consider that development problems are solved, when other nations are exposed to poverty and misery.\\\" [1872nd meeting, para. 145.]\n174.\tTherefore, we should, in listing the possible sources of development capital, mention the need to re-channel the $200,000 million annually tossed into the unproductive and bottomless pit of the arms race.\n175.\tMight we recall that some 20 years ago it was proclaimed necessary to establish a link, for the first time, between development and disarmament? Will the time come when our Organization will be able to address to the military Powers a more urgent and more convincing message than our customary resolutions?\n176.\tThis ideal of disarmament is undoubtedly beginning to find expression in the reduction of certain military budgets and, as a minimum, in \\\"non-armament\\\". Nevertheless, we have not yet seen international economic co-operation being enriched by the redeployment of the resources thus liberated. Is this not a symptom of a real weakness in the tissue of international relations that an obligation that is so frequently reaffirmed nevertheless finds no place in the list of priorities?\n177.\tMoreover, we can see in the distance new tasks which can only be fulfilled if even profounder transformations take place in international life, in legal rules and in new international machinery.\n178.\tThese new requirements postulate the protection of the environment, the organization of atmospheric space and the ocean depths, the internationalization of science and the control of technological evolution, all new problems and phenomena recently brought to light at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm.\n179.\tThese various transformations do not demand that nations forfeit one jot of their sovereignty; they simply suggest a slight modification of the international division of labor.\n180.\tWe remain convinced that a harmonious combination of all these facts will definitely make it possible, in the course of the present decade, to use the full potential of the beneficial influence which the United Nations system can have on promoting human dignity. Will the world then be closer to achieving the rightful aspirations of peoples to freedom, justice and peace?\n181.\tMay our work express better than at previous sessions of the General Assembly this truth that the way towards justice and peace passes nolens volens through the harmonious and conflict-free development of nations and, therefore, through the total development of man.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like at the outset to express my delegation's sincere felicitations on your election as the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high post is indeed a tribute to your eminent qualities as a diplomat and statesman, as well as to your country, which has made valuable contributions to the cause of the United Nations. As I have had the honor to represent my country in Poland, I stand reminded of the depth and richness of your country's culture, and believe that you will ably personify the courage of its people. I have no doubt that you will perform your duties here with the same distinction that has characterized your past public services.\n27.\tI wish also to pay a high tribute to the outgoing President of the Assembly, Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, for his valuable contributions to our Organization.\n28.\tAllow me, moreover, to extend once again my delegation's warmest congratulations-to our new Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on his appointment to this most important office.\n29.\tIt is indeed a source of gratification to continue to have at the helm of this Organization a man of great public distinction and international stature. In the course of the past year he has demonstrated his acute awareness of world problems and in the interest of international peace and security he has taken constructive measures to deal with problems before they reach a critical stage. We are confident he will continue to discharge faithfully, and with devotion and foresight, the awesome responsibilities that have been entrusted to him. My delegation pledges to him its unequivocal support and co-operation.\n30.\tIn this context it is fitting to recall once more the valuable contributions rendered by our former Secretary-General, UThant, whose tireless efforts in the cause of world peace and security will long be remembered.\n31.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly the world has undergone significant changes in both the political and the economic fields. Hie rigid bipolarity of the past is making way for a more diversified and multilateral world power structure.\n32.\tIn the light of these circumstances my delegation views with some optimism the recent unfolding panorama of political events on the world scene.\n33.\tIn this context, the latest developments in Asia deserve our special attention. The People's Republic of China has joined the community of nations. Pragmatic and sustained efforts towards the normalization of relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States has smoothed the way for a policy of coexistence between those two Powers. This new understanding is indeed a milestone in the development of a better political climate in Asia and in the world.\n34.\tThe recent contacts between South and North Korea are fraught with hopeful signs for the eventual reunification of the two parts of Korea and can be considered the first step towards defusing existing frictions in that area.\n35.\tThe latest sequel of political events on the Indian subcontinent also offers encouraging prospects for the restoration of peace. Both Pakistan and India are reviewing their relations and seeking in earnest to find mutually acceptable solutions to their existing problems. The initiative taken by President Bhutto of Pakistan in paving the way for a meeting between the leaders of those two countries in the month of June of this year and the ensuing Simla Agreement are a constructive starting-point and could result in the opening of a new phase in relations between Pakistan and India. It is our fervent hope that the question of disputed territories will be resolved and that the Pakistani prisoners of war will be released in accordance with the relevant Geneva Conventions, thus creating an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of normal relations between the two nations. In this respect, the United Nations should assist in bringing about a just settlement of outstanding disputes as promptly as possible.\n36.\tThe ratification of the friendship and frontier treaties with the Federal Republic of Germany by the Soviet Union and by Poland and the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin are also symbolic of the significant strides made towards creating a detente in Europe. These agreements will no doubt facilitate the road to future negotiations between the countries members of NATO and the countries signatories of the Warsaw Pact with the ultimate aim of convening a conference on European security.\n37.\tThis year's session of the General Assembly is marked by an atmosphere of political realism* The historic summit meetings held in Peking between the leaders of the United States and China and in Moscow between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States have accorded a sharp impetus to forces actively engaged in strengthening the pillars of international security.\n38.\tIndeed, the three global Powers have made landmark progress towards defining their positions and diminishing the causes of misunderstanding in an attempt to relax world tensions and to provide the peoples of the world with a more secure environment in which to live.\n39.\tThe Declaration of Basic Principles of Relations between the United States and the USSR, adopted at Moscow on 29 May 1972, constitutes a strong reaffirmation of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n40.\tThe strategic arms limitation agreements, adopted at Moscow on 26 May 1972, are yet another significant outcome of the conference between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. This and further agreements in areas of mutual interest such as space, science and technology, medical research and trade, are bound to serve peaceful and humanitarian aims and will no doubt reduce international frictions and enhance mutual trust and amity among nations.\n41.\tAll these new developments have left a deep imprint on the standing and composition of our Organization.\n42.\tThe United Nations has consequently expanded its membership and is now approaching its goal of universality.\nLast year, we applauded the restoration of the lawful rights in the United Nations of the People's Republic of China and the admission of five new Members. We hope this trend will continue until the United Nations brings under its roof all countries which remain outside the Organization.\n43.\tHowever, in spite of these favourable trends, the picture of the world scene remains rather dark.\n44.\tThe situation in the Middle East has taken a turn for the worse, especially during recent weeks. The latest armed interventions against Syria and Lebanon have further endangered peace and security in the area. A precarious situation continues to loom large, causing further frustrations and aggravations. The Arab- Republic of Egypt, motivated by a sense of realism and compromise, has made successive peace overtures to Israel with a view to an equitable settlement of all its outstanding disputes. These efforts have, however, met with no positive response and have failed to persuade Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.\n45.\tOther peaceful initiatives have also yielded no results. Ambassador Jarring's mission has not received the cooperation necessary for its successful accomplishment. All indications are, therefore, that nothing concrete has been achieved to resolve the Middle East crisis since the last session of the General Assembly.\n46.\tIn spite of the inability of the Arab States and Israel to reach an agreement, my delegation continues to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) constitutes the most workable basis for u political settlement of existing disputes. In our considered view it is time that more intensified and collective efforts be made within the context of that resolution to eliminate the sources of contention and to guarantee the territorial integrity and independence of all States in the region.\n47.\tSouth-East Asia is another area of the world beset by strife, chronic war and economic dislocation. During the past year, the war in Viet-Nam has expanded with alarming speed and devastating impact. It is our fervent hope, however, that normality and peace will be restored to Viet-Nam within the framework of the Geneva Conventions and on the basis of strict respect for the right of the people to self-determination, to independent development and to the inviolability of their territorial integrity.\n48.\tMore than a decade after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], colonialism persists in dominating certain parts of Africa. In fact, a figure in excess of one tenth of the population of the African continent continues to be oppressed by the colonial yoke and racial discrimination. In Namibia, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), and Zimbabwe, millions of people are being denied their rights to political, social and economic self-expression, to human dignity and to self- determination. Neither the efforts of the United Nations nor the concerted pressure exerted by mankind has succeeded in eliminating the deprivation of human rights and fundamental freedoms inflicted by the colonial Powers.\n49.\tIn this connexion we welcomed the meetings of the Security Council held in Addis Ababa. Those meetings, which brought the members of the Security Council in closer touch with the problems and aspirations of the peoples of Africa, may, hopefully, open the way for the Security Council to take more effective measures in this regard. They have also helped reinforce the determination of the African countries to utilize the instruments of this Organization to combat colonialism, racial discrimination and, in particular, apartheid. It is indeed gratifying that in this realm the Council adopted positive resolutions on some major problems.\n50.\tIt is the earnest hope of my delegation that Members of the United Nations will, in concert, pool their energies to eradicate the last relics of colonialism and racism in all its forms and manifestations.\n51.\tProgress in the field of disarmament since our last session has been encouraging. First and foremost is the adoption and signing of the Convention on the banning of biological weapons.  This Convention holds open the possibility of an agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons and contains an explicit pledge by all parties to reach an early accord in this regard. Combined with past achievements in arms control and disarmament, it is testimony to the progress made by the United Nations in the limitation of armaments. However, it would be purblind optimism to deny that a great deal remains to be done.\n52.\tDespite an agreement reached in principle by the major Powers a decade ago, a substantive programme of general and complete disarmament has yet to be launched. We believe, as we stated last year, that marginal agreements providing for the limitation of armaments in regional or functional areas are not goals in themselves and cannot supplant general and complete disarmament as an ultimate objective [1940th meeting, para 116].\n53.\tIn this connexion it is indeed a source of dismay that little progress has been achieved in the vital area of a comprehensive test ban. The partial test-ban Treaty  has been at the most a qualified success and, due to its restricted sphere of control, has left the door open to the increasing use of underground testing. The question of inspection stands as the main obstacle to a comprehensive test-ban Treaty, but has not precluded progress in other areas of disarmament.\n54.\tTo cite the most recent example, the strategic arms limitation agreements, concluded in May of this year, are based on an \\\"open skies\\\" inspection system. Therefore, it is a matter for regret that the faith and the trust demonstrated in this case and in the case of other important agreements have not served as a yardstick for an agreement on a comprehensive test ban.\n55.\tWe consider the agreements concluded in Moscow in May of this year to be of seminal importance. The agreements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics designed to impose quantitative limits on their strategic weapons and to expand their relations in the field of trade, medicine and space, provide ample evidence of the desire of both countries to advance from mere detente and coexistence to active co-operation.\n56.\tWe hope the momentum gained will continue to increase in the future and result in a wider and more comprehensive agreement covering the entire European continent. We also hope that these practical achievements will have an encouraging and beneficial effect on the whole spectrum of issues relating to conventional and nuclear disarmament. In fact, we anxiously look forward to the day when man's inventive genius in creating weapons of total destruction will be employed with equal effectiveness and skill in achieving total disarmament.\n57.\tThe preservation of our environment has also assumed a new dimension and importance for all the States and peoples of the world. It is a subject which directly impinges on their survival, well-being, and socio-economic development. Nations can no longer afford to be heedless about the vulnerability of their ecology and natural resources to misuse and contamination.\n58.\tDuring the past five years, the findings of science have made us aware of the environmental consequences of material progress either in hiospheric or psycho-social terms. They have awakened the consciousness of mankind to its natural heritage and instilled in us a sense of responsibility to future generations.\n59.\tThe rising world-wide concern focused on this problem led the United Nations to convene the first major international conference on the human environment in Stockholm. The historic Declaration of the Conference has established a set of guidelines which could, if implemented in good faith, arrest and perhaps even reverse the increasing deterioration of the quality of life on our planet.\n60.\tWith this conviction, the Iranian Government has, in recent years, engaged in a series of conservational reform laws including the nationalization of its forests, rangeland and water resources.\n61.\tThe International Conference on the Conservation of Wetlands and Waterfowl, held at Ramsar in Iran, which received unanimous support by ail the participating countries, was an apt illustration of Iran's deep interest in all aspects of conservation. It was on this occasion that the foundation for the establishment in southern Iran of an ecological research station of global scope, ie. joint trust with an appropriate international agency at the Arjan International Environmental Reserve, was laid to underline the pressing needs of contemporary society. Moreover, Iran has decided to offer an annual international award in the amount of $20,000 for the most outstanding contribution made in the field of human environment. Iran has also taken steps to establish an urgently needed monitoring\n3 See Report of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Stockholm, 5-16 June 1972 (United Nations publications, Sales No. E.73.II.A.14), chap. I.\nsystem to control pollution in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. We have also signed a protocol with the Government of the Soviet Union laying down conditions for the prevention of pollution of the Caspian Sea; it is hoped this protocol will result in a bilateral convention. In addition, our two Governments have been in contact with a view to concluding, within the framework of the Ramsar Agreement, accords of a similar nature regarding our common wildlife resources.\n62.\tAnother area of rising importance is the peaceful uses of the sea. The ocean has opened a new horizon to man's needs and expectations. This issue involves not only the exploration and exploitation of the virgin resources of the sea but also the formation of new regimes for law, politics and socio-economics.\n63.\tIt is generally agreed that the sea-bed provides a fertile field for the devising of new laws of the sea. This consensus is clearly reflected in the Declaration of Principles, approved by the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly,  which delineated modalities for progress in this field. We are of the belief that, on the issue of the law of the sea, any successful multilateral initiative must represent and adequately accommodate various interests in socioeconomic terms and aiso take into consideration geographical and geological problems.\n64.\tIn the area of economics and trade, we are still living under archaic and radically unjust economic precepts governing relations among States. Under present conditions, the division of material prosperity which separates the developing and the developed countries will become sharper, and the widening gap of economic imbalance among nations will prove even more difficult to bridge.\n65.\tIn this regard the hopes pinned on the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) had discouraging results. The deliberations of the Conference were marked by the intransigence of economically advanced countries, which did not wish to accommodate their interests to the rising needs of the economically less advanced nations and by the refusal of the former to use trade and monetary policies to redress the existing imbalance.\n66.\tMy August Sovereign clearly described this problem at the fifty-seventh session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva in June this year:\n\\\"There is no doubt that the elimination of commercial rivalries, the removal of the barriers which now exist in this domain and international monetary stabilization are of vital importance for the developing countries. .. .prices of exports from industrialist countries are constantly rising.... In other words, when the industrialized countries export their products, they also export inflation...\n\\\"The inflationary methods practiced by the industrialized countries have caused an increase in interest rates and, consequently, foreign loans to the developing countries have become more expensive.\\\" \n67.\tIt is therefore essential that provision be made to guarantee a stable and just price for the raw materials and primary products of the less developed countries, in order to cushion recurring price fluctuations. In any policy adopted by the economically advanced nations and designed to reorganize the structure of the international monetary system for the purpose of ensuring greater world, financial stability, the interests of less advanced countries, as well as those of the entire community of nations, should be adequately reflected. These remedies, in addition to the implementation of UNCTAD's recommendation that the economically advanced countries should allocate 1 per cent of their gross national product for assistance to the less advanced nations, could serve as an effective means of coping with some of the problems which beset the international community.\n68.\tBefore concluding, I wish to turn to a question which deserves particular attention. The rise in terrorism and violence in recent times has aroused concern and indignation throughout the world. We deplore and condemn such acts, which endanger or take innocent lives. The rule of law is of paramount importance to all of us. If we allow lawlessness to continue unchecked, the United Nations will be totally undermined.\n69.\tThe Secretary-General should be commended for having taken the initiative to invite the attention of the United Nations [A/8791 and Add.l] to a matter which threatens to throw the whole fabric of the international order into disarray. We believe that the problem should be dealt with most urgently in all its aspects, including its underlying causes. It is high time the United Nations took necessary and effective measures to curb and eradicate terrorism in all its forms.\n70.\tEvery year, as we enter this majestic hall to pay a tribute to the founders of the United Nations for the contribution they have made to the pursuit of a lasting peace for humanity, our hearts yearn with the hope of accomplishment. It is once again the deep-seated wish of my Government and delegation to voice this hope.\n71.\tAs developments last year have shown, we are confident that, given a spirit of compromise and reconciliation, greater progress could be made in reducing threats to peace and security throughout the world. We therefore look to the future with optimism. In the final analysis, it is our earnest hope that concrete steps will be taken to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations as a universal peace machinery, with the aim of converting theaters of conflict and areas of discord into fields ripe for co-operation and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "10 Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on the assumption of the presidency of this General Assembly session. We are certain of your outstanding abilities and of your distinguished career, which will enable you to perform your high office in the best possible way. Your election, Seaside from its significance as an indication of the great esteem in which you are held, represents at the same time appreciation for the contributions of your great friendly country, the Polish People's Republic, with which we maintain cordial relations.\n95.\tAt the same time, I should like to be permitted to express our thanks to your great predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, who presided with sagacity over the twenty-sixth session of the Assembly. His experience and great competence contributed in no small measure to the success of the last session.\n96.\tMoreover, it gives us great pleasure to express to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our sincere congratulations in extending to him our best wishes for success in his undertakings. We are cognizant of the great difficulties which confront each holder of this high office. However, we are fully confident of Mr. Waldheim's ability to face successfully the hardships inherent in the nature of this position.\n97.\tThe United Nations acquires with each year of its existence added importance in the affairs of mankind. This is due, not only to the increase in its membership and to the fact that it is an important instrument for achieving understanding in our troubled world, but also to the high hope of peoples everywhere that our Organization will attain its objectives by establishing world peace on the basis of justice and by eliminating wars once and for all.\n98.\tThe United Nations Charter has given eloquent expression to these human hopes and aspirations. Nevertheless, many of these hopes and aspirations have remained to this day mere words. For, with the exception of a few limited successes accomplished by this Organization, man in large areas of our world remains subjected to injustice, exploitation and the horrors of war. In other areas of the globe, men still suffer from poverty, fear, discrimination, segregation, ignorance and intimidation. However, the United Nations and its Charter remain to a great extent a new hope felt by the millions of humankind.\n99.\tThe People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, which is a faithful believer in the purposes of the United Nations and the vitality of its role, is one of the countries whose population suffers from some of those circumstances to which I have just alluded. British imperialism, which has exploited our people for more than a century, has left in its wake only poverty, ignorance, disease and underdevelopment in a variety of forms.\n100.\tIt was therefore incumbent upon us to work towards the elimination of this burdensome inheritance. We are working toward this goal through the participation of the masses in the countryside and urban areas in the implementation of the programs and plans formulated by the Revolutionary Government. Our aim is to change the ugly situation bequeathed to us by the colonialists during their occupation, and to build a new life in which the minority would not have a monopoly of wealth and comfort while the majority continues to live under the conditions of hardship that were endured before independence.\n101.\tOur people are fully cognizant of the importance of economic independence and of popular control of their economic means as an indispensable factor for bolstering our political independence. Toward this goal, the Revolutionary Government put into effect various measures whose sole aim is to benefit our masses. With this in view, it was necessary for our people to regain their rights through the elimination of the exploitation of those economic establishments which contributed to the sabotaging and stagnation of our national economy. Under the laws of 27 November 1969, banks and foreign commercial enterprises of a monopolistic character were nationalized so that, at the present time, with workers participating in their management, they aim at the welfare and progress of our people. As a result, these organizations are at present making considerable contributions towards the implementation of our economic development plan. Under this plan, all our projects slated for execution during the first years of the plan have successfully been carried out.\n102.\tMoreover, in accordance with the plan, many small factories have been built to meet the needs of our domestic consumption and to widen the range of services of which our masses were deprived during the British occupation. Student enrollment at various levels of education has doubled. Health-care units have been increased in numbers, especially in rural areas, where the majority of our people live. Potable water projects have been undertaken with special attention to rural needs. New networks of roads and electrification have been undertaken for the benefit of additional sectors of consumers. All this is being accomplished in spite of the paucity of resources and economic means available to our country.\n103.\tAs to agriculture, the necessary measures have been taken to put the land reform acts into effect. The goal has been the liberation of our peasant from intimidation and exploitation, ills which for hundreds of years he has suffered at the hand of feudalism. For the first time, thanks to these measures, hundreds of thousands of peasants enjoy political and economic freedoms; the arable area has been extended; the number of landowners who are members of co-operatives has increased. This experiment has also proved its value in enhancing our production, improving our crops, raising the standard of living of our peasants, who experienced, after a brief period of time, the positive aspects of co-operative work in their daily lives. This evokes in their memories the sharp contrasts with the bygone dark period of exploitation and oppression which they, and their forefathers, experienced under the yoke of colonial domination.\n104.\tThese measures, which have been taken by the Revolutionary Government for the welfare of the impoverished masses of our population, meet the full support of our people, who are the beneficiaries. However, the attempts to belittle those accomplishments and the repeated campaigns to misrepresent our revolutionary measures and to cast doubt on their intent and efficacy have never ceased. Conspiracies are being organized outside our borders by imperialist and reactionary agents with the aim of intervention in our domestic affairs, thus posing a threat to the independence and the security of our people. This situation has unfortunately compelled us, as it has caused other developing nations which are being subjected to this kind of aggression, to employ the greater part of our resources for the purpose of self-defense.\n105.\tThe forces of imperialism, which are headed by the United States and the United Kingdom, and their local reactionaries do not hide their displeasure at the successes which the national struggle in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, under the leadership of the National Front, has attained. Our political organization, as represented by the National Front, which successfully waged the armed struggle for independence, is now leading our popular struggle for construction and social progress.\n106.\tThe democratic measures which the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen is carrying out internally and the success which those measures are meeting are the object of support and admiration not only on the part of our people but also on the part of all countries and peoples which strive for peace and prosperity for the Yemeni people and humanity at large; but the imperialist and reactionary forces ignore our people's determination to safeguard their independence. Those forces continue their attempts to meddle in our domestic affairs, resorting to various criminal methods which threaten the security and national independence of our people.\n107.\tThe foreign policy of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen aims at bolstering peace in the Arab world as well as in the whole world, at supporting the quest of peoples for self-determination, and at opposing any intervention in the internal affairs of States. Thus my country supports the just struggle of the Arab peoples and all other peoples for the liberation of their lands from foreign occupation and imperialist domination. For we believe that peace is unattainable until the imperialist States desist from their policies of intervention and the use of force designed to subject peoples and nations to their control and to pillage their resources. At the same time we believe that imperialist and reactionary forces will not desist from those actions until the will of the peoples forces them to do so.\n108.\tOur position is in full accord with the great principles of the United Nations Charter and United Nations decisions which call for the right of all peoples to live in peace and in freedom from all forms of aggression, intervention and oppression.\n109.\tIn spite of the great developments witnessed in our world since the United Nations Charter was formulated, and in spite of the gigantic victories achieved by the peoples of the world as a result of their perseverance, sacrifices and determination to secure their rights to freedom, peace and progress, the colonial and imperialist Powers are still ignoring the interests of other peoples and their rights. Those Powers resort to aggression and the use of force in order to impose their control, either directly or through client regimes which carry out their policies. TTiat situation, which is harmful to the interests of all peoples, is conducive to a state of tension everywhere, and jeopardizes peace in the areas affected by such colonialist and imperialist machinations.\n110.\tThe successes thus far achieved in international relations, in the sphere of international co-operation and in easing world tension have not put an end to imperialist wars waged by United States imperialism and Zionism against the Arab peoples and the peoples of IndoChina. The progress that I referred to earlier has not brought to an end the colonial wars being waged by Portugal against the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), and other parts of struggling Africa. African peoples are still subjected to the injustices of apartheid, practiced by the white minorities with the encouragement of imperialist and Zionist circles.\n111.\tIn the Middle East, the Palestinian people face genocide as part of an imperialist and Zionist conspiracy aimed at liquidating them and putting an end to their heroic struggle. This is an attempt to liquidate the Palestine problem in a manner which contravenes justice and the rights provided for in the United Nations Charter and in United Nations resolutions. The violence to which the Palestinian people is subjected generates the violence which the Palestinians undertake in self-defense. Such a situation leads to 'the harming of innocent victims and endangers the lives of many others. As a result, a situation exists today which endangers international peace and security.\n112.\tThe violence to which the Palestinian people have resorted in self-defense is a legitimate measure, born out of the injustice and terror practiced against them. Is there a greater injustice than to deprive a whole people of its country by means of terror, as was done by the Zionists in their aggression against the Palestinian people? This has been perpetuated with the encouragement and support of United States imperialism, which lures the rulers of Israel into committing more crimes through making United States military and economic assistance available to them. The United States offers aid and encouragement to Israel's rulers in their aggressive policies towards the Arab people. Those policies have resulted in the occupation of territories in three Arab States, Members of the United Nations, and the dispersion into exile of the Palestinian people.\n113.\tIsrael persists in its occupation of Arab territories and is disregarding resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. Moreover, Israel has recently committed massive acts of aggression against Lebanese and Syrian territories. As a result of that latest aggression, hundreds of innocent people, including women and children, have been killed. In addition, Israel's rulers have announced publicly their intention to commit more criminal acts in reprisal against the Arab countries which refuse to surrender to Zionist designs. In the course of those aggressive acts, camps of Palestinian refugees are entirely destroyed by the Israeli armed forces in order physically to liquidate the refugees. Israel thus re-enacts, by its crimes, the acts which the Nazis perpetrated against the Jews and other people who were subjected to Nazi aggression.\n114.\tFurthermore, the Arab inhabitants of the Israeli- occupied territories are subjected to the most brutal forms of aggression and torture by Israel's forces of occupation. Those Arabs are systematically deprived of their personal belongings, expelled from their homes, deprived of their lands and forced to be resettled in other areas in accordance with Israeli plans which aim at the dispersion of the Arabs and their replacement by Jewish immigrants. Here the aims include the weakening of the Palestinian resistance movement and the elimination of the Palestinian Arab people.\n115.\tHowever, Israel can no longer hide the import of its plans from the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples. Those schemes today face heroic resistance by the Arabs of the occupied territories. Faced with that situation, Israel resorts to the most cruel measures, which add to the hostility felt by the Arab inhabitants towards the forces of occupation, induce the Palestinian Arab people to offer greater resistance and strengthen their determination to exercise their inherent rights in their national homeland and to liberate the occupied territories.\n116.\tIn addition, the Arab States whose territories are still under Israeli occupation will not exercise their patience endlessly and will not yield to the humiliations of Israeli occupation. Those Arab countries will resist; they will eliminate the aggression and liberate their territories, supported by all of the Arab world and by all peace-loving nations.\n117.\tThe United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, whose resolutions have been flouted by Israel, is today called upon to take the necessary measures to support the cause of the Arab people, including the Palestinian people, especially their struggle to regain their usurped rights. This Organization is called upon to condemn Israel and Israeli aggression against the Arab lands and people, an aggression which receives from the United States not only arms but also political support, recently manifested by the United States veto in the Security Council of a draft resolution which called only for the cessation of military operations and the exercise of restraint.1 1 By exercising that veto, the United States has given yet additional proof of its complete bias in favor of aggressive Israel. In fact, that stand makes the United States a party to the aggression to which the Arab people are subjected.\n118.\tThe Arab peoples, who are anxious to preserve their friendship with the great American people, cannot ignore the hostile stance adopted by the United States Government, which is detrimental to the Arab peoples' interests and security. The United States position in this conflict endangers United States interests in the Arab world, which, when harmed, will remind the United States authorities of the great loss incurred by them as a result of their hostility towards the just cause and legitimate rights of the Arabs.\n119.\tThe imperialist Powers, headed by the United States and Great Britain, which control the greatest portion of the huge oil riches of the Arabian peninsula and the Arabian Gulf, have embarked on schemes aimed at placing the area within their sphere of influence, either directly or through their stooges. These puppets of imperialism act in utter disregard for the wishes of their peoples, who yearn for liberation and the restoration of their national control over their natural resources, which are being pillaged by monopolistic enterprises. The goal of imperialism in our area is clear. It is to strengthen the imperialistic and neo-colonialist grip over the Arabian peninsula and the Arabian Gulf.\n120.\tThese schemes are being concocted while the population of the area suffers from severe conditions of poverty and want and is deprived of the benefits which accrue in billions of dollars, representing the profits exacted by the other monopolies. It goes without saying that these monopolistic profiteers care nothing about the requisites for a decent life for the people-the people who are the rightful owners of these riches and who are the object of the worst forms of repression, intimidation and exploitation.\n121.\tThus, the population of the entire area is subjected to repeated acts of aggressive intervention by imperialist forces, which are now doubling their weaponry and their military establishments and whose single aim is aggression with a view to halting the popular struggle for freedom and national independence. The American and British imperialistic designs which threaten the peace and security of the area and its population add to world tensions and undermine the possibilities of international peace.\n122.\tThe Yemeni people in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen cannot speak of the prospects of international peace while many peoples around the globe are subjected to United States imperialism. The United States has arrogated to itself the functions of international policeman. It is spreading destruction and terror in our world, which yearns for peace. The massive genocide being carried out by United States aggression against the heroic people of Viet-Nam, both North and South, is a crime which cannot be ignored through verbiage about peace. The persistence of the United States imperialists in their criminal and brutal aggression against the great Vietnamese people, with the purposes of destroying Vietnamese national life and of breaking the Vietnamese will to resist even single-handedly, is a threat to peoples everywhere and to international peace and security. It is well known that United States aggression has been expanded to cover all the peoples of IndoChina, where Laos and Cambodia are also the targets of American imperialism.\n123.\tOur Government has given its support to the seven- point program set forth by the Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam. This program calls for putting an end to United States intervention and aggression and to the Vietnamization of this war, which will meet with the same failure that has attended all other aggressive schemes as a result of the determination of the great Vietnamese people to resist aggression.\n124.\tOn this occasion we salute the Vietnamese people in \\\"both the North and the South who demonstrate with every passing day that they deserve all admiration, respect and international solidarity. All nations see in the struggle of the Vietnamese people against United States aggression their own struggle. For the aggression to which the VietNamese people are now subjected is the same aggression which peoples in other parts of the world, including the Arab world, are at present facing. We also salute the American people who resist the aggressive policies of their Government and offer assistance to the victims of the aggression of United States militarism.\n125.\tThe aggressive policies of the circles of imperialism are the impediments to humanity's search for peace. These policies add to the complexity of problems in more than one corner of the world. We see how the Korean people aspire to unity and to the elimination of foreign intervention. However, the United States insists on impeding the search for a solution to the Korean problem, hiding its aggression and its occupation of South Korea under the United Nations flag. Such a state of affairs cannot continue, or we shall be contributing to the tragedy represented by the division of the Korean nation and helping to hide the crime of United States occupation and United States intervention in the internal affairs of other peoples.\n126.\tAt the same time, the United States prevents the people of Puerto Rico from attaining its independence, although that people is struggling for the attainment of its full sovereignty in its country and has a right to self- determination.\n127.\tIn order to fulfill the great purposes set forth in its Charter and the great hopes of the peoples of the world, the United Nations is duty-bound to increase its support for peoples under foreign occupation and alien domination. Those peoples must be made to feel that the resolutions adopted by this world Organization are serious international decisions. Thus, the United Nations should adopt the measures necessary to put its resolutions into effect, through the imposition of severe sanctions which compel compliance with United Nations resolutions.\n128.\tUnited Nations sanctions should therefore be immediately applied to Israel, Portugal and South Africa for their disregard for all resolutions calling for the ending of the criminal and repressive measures imposed by those countries on the areas they occupy and for the elimination of apartheid. My Government, which supports the struggle of the colonized peoples of Africa and upholds the natural rights of the Palestinian people, will join forces with all States which support the imposition of these sanctions. We are ready to undertake these supportive measures since we believe this to be the only practical method whereby United Nations resolutions could be implemented and the rights of these oppressed populations upheld in the face of the savage policies of aggression of which they are made the targets.\n129.\tAs we dwell here on the possibilities of peace and the relaxation of international tensions in our world, we should note with great appreciation the positive efforts made by the socialist countries in those domains. In particular, we note the successful efforts of those countries for the establishment of peace in Europe and for the safeguarding of equal rights and opportunities for all States in that continent.\n130.\tWe should also reiterate our support for the German Democratic Republic's right to membership in this Organization. In this connexion we bear in mind the peaceful policies implemented by the German Democratic Republic for the strengthening of international peace and cooperation. At the same time, we should recall here the aggressive policies followed by the reactionary circles of the Federal Republic of Germany, which are aimed at placing obstacles in the way to the implementation of the accords on peace and co-operation on the European continent. We are convinced that peace in Europe is related to the establishment of peace in other areas of the world.\n131.\tPeace is also intertwined with the elimination of war and aggression in the Middle East, IndoChina and Africa, with the withdrawal of the forces of aggression from those areas, and with recognition of the right of all peoples to freedom and national sovereignty. Through those measures, international peace would be ensured and guaranteed in our world.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to express to you on behalf of the Government of the State of Kuwait heartfelt congratulations on your election to your high office. I should like to commend the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience and an outstanding reputation. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, for the manner in which he presided over the past session of the General Assembly. May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Waldheim, our Secretary-General, on his assumption of the responsibilities of Secretary-General of the United Nations. His indefatigable energy and zeal and his long diplomatic experience augur well for the future of our Organization.\n152.\tKuwait welcomes the symptoms of detente and reconciliation which are visible in many parts of the world, especially in the relations between the big Powers. Several recent developments on the world political scene may truly be said to mark an era of change. The Moscow agreements, imposing certain quantitative limitations on strategic nuclear weapon systems, have given rise to great hopes that they will be followed by additional measures in the field of disarmament and open new vistas of co-operation in all aspects of international relations. While expressing satisfaction with the new trend we should, however, express our profound belief that amity among big Powers should never be achieved at the expense of the small countries and that co-operation among the super-Powers should not imply dividing the world into spheres of influence or establishing a partnership in world hegemony.\n153.\tOur attitude is in conformity with the policy of the non-aligned countries which during the Conference of their Foreign Ministers held in August in Guyana, affirmed their adherence to the policy of non-alignment and their anxiety to maintain the international balance of power and to protect the small countries from becoming tools in the hands of the big Powers.\n154.\tThe entry into force of the treaties between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany and between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin have removed the major obstacles to the development of constructive co-operation among all the countries of the European continent. The preparations for the convening of a European conference on security and co-operation are further evidence of the relaxation of international tension and the improvement of relations between the socialist and Western countries.\n155.\tThese political improvements create a favorable atmosphere for the intensification of efforts towards disarmament. Kuwait supported the proposal to hold a world disarmament conference. One of the basic prerequisites for the success of the conference would be to secure universal participation in the conference. We hope that the projected world disarmament conference would provide the right forum for a universal effort to achieve our common goal of general and complete disarmament. However, the conference should adopt as one of its basic principles the necessity of allocating a major part of the resources released by the reduction of military budgets to the economic and social development of the developing countries.\n156.\tMay I express the satisfaction of the Government of Kuwait with the encouraging developments in the negotiations for the reunification of North and South Korea? Kuwait, which is opposed to the partition of any country and which steadfastly upholds the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, sincerely hopes that the reunification of Korea will be achieved peacefully and without foreign interference and that all foreign troops will be withdrawn from Korea.\n157.\tThe goals of the United Nations are of such a nature as virtually to require universal membership for their successful fulfillment. We hope that countries which have not yet been admitted to the United Nations will soon take their seats in this hall. Meanwhile, we would like non- members to take an active part in the activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, as no doubt they can make a valuable contribution to the work of our Organization. The restitution of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China was a major international event which brought our Organization nearer to achieving the goal of universality. China has already demonstrated its role as an independent great Power which is not involved in the conflict between the two camps. Its presence among us has reinforced the ranks of the developing countries who see in China a reliable ally and a true friend.\n158.\tThe President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development painted a grim picture of the conditions of life for the 40 per cent of the world population who live in the developing countries. He blamed the advanced countries for failing to fulfill the 1 per cent target of providing aid to the developing countries during the Second United Nations Development Decade. He also predicted that the developing countries would not be able to attain the agreed target of 6 per cent of economic growth each year.\n159.\tThis is a realistic evaluation following the outcome of the third session of UNCTAD, held at Santiago in April and May, which gave rise to wide disappointment and disillusionment. The ill-will which lurks behind the reluctance of the advanced countries to provide aid and outlets for the exports of the developing countries is a matter of serious concern to all of us as it prevents the fulfillment of the aims of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n160.\tI hope that events will disprove these predictions and that there., will be a change of heart among the rich countries, which will realize that much more is at stake than the question of trade and development. Poverty is a deadly enemy of mankind that dwells at the root of most world problems. It is not yet too late to wage a war against poverty and to collaborate in providing for all people the blessings of social welfare and prosperity.\n161.\tRejoicing over the relaxation of international tension in some areas should not divert our attention from deep-rooted problems in other areas of the world in which no progress towards solution has been experienced, but should rather stimulate redoubled efforts by the international community to deal effectively with those problems, the continuation of which constitutes a permanent threat to international peace and security and a perpetual challenge to the ideals and purposes of the Charter.\n162.\tThe international order continues to be confronted with its gravest challenges in South-East Asia, in West Asia and in southern Africa. In each of these regions the rules of civilized conduct and of international law continue to be violated daily; contempt for the value of human life continues to be manifested in its ugliest forms; and the fruits of modern civilization-organization and technology continue to be employed for destruction and defilement of those very values and principles without which civilization cannot flourish.\n163.\tThe year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has witnessed in Viet-Nam an escalation of violence-in its instruments and methods, as well as in the pretexts for its use. In the Middle East and in southern Africa, on the other hand, it has witnessed continuing attempts to entrench the faits accomplis which have been achieved by aggression, usurpation and racist domination, and by continued disregard for the international will.\n164.\tThe essential similarity between the regimes which are responsible for the rise and exacerbation of the deep-rooted problems in southern Africa and the Middle East has become quite evident. In each of those two regions we see regimes of alien colonists established through the usurpation of the homelands and property of indigenous peoples, and the subjugation or dispersion of those peoples in accordance with the precepts of the racist policy which is the raison d'etre of the regimes in question meet every struggle for national liberation with ruthless suppression and official governmental terrorism.\n165.\tIf we focus our attention on the situation in the Middle East we will observe that it has recently been characterized as far as the Israeli occupation of territories of neighboring Arab States is concerned-by two principal features: first, the suspension of international efforts to achieve a political settlement; and, second, the escalation of Israeli endeavors to transform the temporary military occupation into permanent de facto control and eventually into de jure expansionist annexation.\n166.\tResponsibility for the suspension of international efforts to achieve a political settlement has been formally established by the General Assembly in its resolution 2799 (XXVI), in which \\\"the positive reply given by Egypt to the Special Representative's initiative for establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East \\\" was noted with appreciation; while Israel was asked \\\"to respond favorably\\\" to that initiative. But Israel's position has not changed since the adoption of that resolution, and the international initiatives have therefore been suspended.\n167.\tIt is imperative that this clear Israeli responsibility for the frustration and resultant suspension of international initiatives aimed at achieving a just and peaceful settlement of the crisis of the Middle East be borne in mind when the renewal of such initiatives is considered. For it was Israel's rejection of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war or conquest and its rejection of the practical corollary thereof, namely, the mandatory withdrawal from the occupied territories, that was the rock on which all international initiatives have founded whether those taken by the United Nations or within its framework, or those taken by individual States or groups of States.\n168.\tIsrael's responsibility for frustrating all attempts at achieving a peaceful settlement of the problem also reveals the spuriousness of its claimed longing for peace.\n169.\tQuestions or doubts in the mind of observers of the Middle East situation about the reason why Israel deliberately aborts every international effort to attain a peaceful settlement in the region while its leaders ceaselessly voice an alleged aspiration for peace find their answer in Israel's policies and practices in the territories occupied since 1967. Those territories have been the scene of tireless Israeli efforts to eliminate their Arab character and to replace it by an Israeli character-demographically, culturally, socially, economically and juridically. This program, in turn, is calculated to serve the Israeli policy of transforming the status of the occupied territories: from that of territories under military occupation, through a transitional period in which they are annexed by Israel in fact but not in name, to the final status of Israeli territories in the full sense of the term. This is the policy of annexation through conquest, the policy of expansion through war, the policy of the acquisition of territories by force, which is outlawed in the Charter and declared by the Security Council and the General Assembly in a number of resolutions to be inadmissible and incompatible with the principles of the international community and the rules of international law.\n170.\tThe Israeli practices of oppression in the occupied territories and the clear-cut violations of the norms of humane, civilized conduct, as well as the rules of international law, particularly those enshrined in the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949,  are thus but Israel's means of overcoming the obstacles which stand in the way of its achieving its expansionist aims.\n171.\tIt will be recalled that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories, established by the General Assembly, has found that an organic relationship obtains between Israel's designs to annex the occupied territories, on the one hand, and its violations of the Geneva Conventions, on the other; that the General Assembly has repeatedly condemned Israeli policies and practices; and that the Commission on Human Rights has declared at its latest session that \\\"grave breaches of the fourth Geneva Convention committed by Israel in the occupied Arab territories constitute war crimes and an affront to humanity\\\". \n172.\tThe crisis in the Middle East is not confined to the situation created by the Israeli aggression of 1967 and the resultant occupation. This aspect of the problem is in fact a derivative; it is the result of the underlying, original problem, namely, the fate of the Palestinian people and its homeland. The General Assembly has in fact shown belated awareness of this obvious fact when it declared in resolutions adopted in 1970 and 1971 that there can be no durable and lasting peace in the Middle East unless the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the rights of return and self-determination, are fully respected and observed.\n173.\tThe costly and strenuous battle waged in recent years by the Palestinian people for the restoration of its rights constitutes its response, not only to the Zionist usurpation of its homeland and to the displacement and oppression it has suffered at the hands of Israel, but also to the complacency of the international community about Israel's persistent violation of Palestinian rights through usurpation, displacement and oppression. After some 20 years of patient and hopeful expectation, after waiting all that time for some action by the international community to live up to its pledges and to ensure the implementation of its resolutions, and after the frustration of all those hopes and expectations, a new generation of Palestinians has at last arisen to shoulder the burdens of its destiny and to wage its own battle for return, for liberation and for the restoration of its rights.\n174.\tThe world-which for. 20 years has abandoned the Palestinian people and left it at the mercy of those who have usurped its homeland, displaced it and deprived it of the opportunity to enjoy a life of dignity in its own country and which, contenting itself with reiterating its recognition of the right of return, has done absolutely nothing to make it possible for Palestinians to enjoy in fact the fulfillment of that cherished hope-cannot now absolve itself of its responsibility for the frustration experienced by the Palestinian people or for the desperation that it generates or the extremism to which it may lead.\n175.\tThe United Nations is indeed called upon to engage in earnest soul-searching and bold self-criticism, and to admit its share of responsibility both for the fate suffered by the Palestinian people and for such consequences as it has already begun to generate.\n176.\tIsraeli outcries have recently been heard about what Israeli propaganda chooses to call Palestinian terrorism. Clearly the objective is to divert attention from the terrorism perpetrated by Israel itself in and across the occupied territories. At the same time, Israel hopes that by misrepresenting the true nature of the Palestinian national liberation movement it may succeed in neutralizing some of the sympathy which that movement has elicited from all those who believe in the liberty of peoples and uphold their right to struggle for the restoration of their rights. Nor is it far-fetched to assume that one of the purposes of the current Israeli campaign is to provide in advance justification for some new expansionist venture in Arab territories long coveted but not yet conquered by Israel.\n177.\tWhatever the aims of the Israeli campaign of vilification may be, the incontestable fact remains that Israel is not so much the victim as the author of terrorism in the Middle East. For it was by means of terrorism that Israel was established. It was by means of terrorism that Israel came to acquire the lands it now occupies and it now exploits. And it was by means of terrorism that Israel transformed an innocent people living peacefully in its own ancestral homeland into a people half of which is displaced and dispersed outside its homeland while the other half suffers deprivation and humiliation under Israeli rule or military occupation.\n178.\tNor was the terrorism through which Israel was founded transitory, or the product of passing circumstances or momentary impulses. Nor indeed was it the aberration of a small group of dissident extremists outside the Zionist mainstream. It was, on the contrary, a purposeful, planned and organized terrorism. It was an official terrorism, methodically practiced and carefully calculated in its timing, its methods, and its targets.\n179.\tThere is a vast difference between the two situations. In the one case a people struggles for the liberation of its land and the restoration of its rights; and deprivation and desperation drive a handful of its members to acts of terrorism against the usurpers of its land and rights. In the other case the Government of a Member of the United Nations has systematically practiced terrorism, not only since the birth of that State, but also long after its establishment and up to this very day.\n180.\tIn the period preceding the establishment of Israel the Zionist terrorist acts were attributed to, and admitted by, some organized groups, notably the Irgun and the Stern organizations, which pretended to constitute the opposition within the Zionist movement and posed as dissenters from the Zionist program of action. But documents released at that time by the Mandatory Government and the memories published later by the leaders of those organizations themselves authoritatively give the lie to those pretenses, and reveal irrefutably the full dimensions of the collusion and co-ordination which obtained between the so-called extremist organizations and the official agencies of Zionism in every terrorist act perpetrated by the former.\n181.\tIndeed, no sooner was Israel established than the mask was lifted: the organizations formerly described as \\\"extremist\\\" were merged into the regular Israeli army and their leaders brought into the ruling establishment, some becoming members of parliament, others ministers, and others deputy prime ministers. Thus those who planned or executed the assassination of Lord Moyne, Count Bernadotte or Colonel Serot, the blowing-up of the King David Hotel over the heads of its residents or the massacre of Deir Yasin came to occupy high civilian and military positions in Israel. Overnight, professional terrorists were transformed into statesmen occupying key positions in a Government which readily embraced the practice of terrorism as though it were a legitimate instrument of national policy.\n182.\tThe bond which, before the establishment of Israel, had linked Zionism with terrorism was not severed after the rise of Israel and its admission to membership of the United Nations. All that happened in the new era was that Zionist terrorism underwent a metamorphosis, a change of form but not of substance.\n183.\tIt is true that in the first few years following the signing of the general armistice agreements the Israeli Government tried to continue the pretense of the pre-Israeli period, attributing the raids conducted by its regular armed forces across the armistice demarcation lines and the accompanying massacres to imaginary groups of irregulars as it did, for example, in the cases of Qibya and Nahhalin. But United Nations observers confirmed in every instance that it was the regular armed forces of Israel that made the raids and perpetrated the massacres.\n184.\tBefore long, Israel abandoned the pretense and took to open, unmasked terrorism. Beginning with the attack on\nGaza in 1955 and the massacres of Kafr Qasin and Khan Yunis in 1956, Israel unleashed a series of attacks which reached their climax on the eve of the aggression of 1967 in the Sammu'i raid.\n185.\tThe aggression of 1967 ushered in a new era, in which Israel's participation in official terrorism escalated. It involved its air force in terrorist actions, unleashing without restraint its airmen against civilian populations and civilian establishments to rain death upon laborers in Egyptian factories and children in Egyptian schools, and upon women and old men and children in the villages and towns of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria and the refugee camps in those countries.\n186.\tMoreover, a new field for Israeli terrorism was opened up in that era. I refer now to the occupied territories. This Assembly has received official reports containing ample evidence of this category of Israeli terrorism: including torture under interrogation and torture in detention; detention of thousands without trial; arbitrary demolition of homes; expulsion of people from their homes, their villages and their country; imposition of collective punishment; detention of the families and kin of freedom-fighters as hostages in desert concentration camps; and similar arbitrary and inhuman practices.\n187.\tNor was Israel content with these varieties of terrorism. It has been committing actions which are normally the hallmark of gangs operating outside the pale of law and order. Thus it has stooped to kidnapping civilian and military personnel from the territories of neighboring Arab States, refusing to release some of them despite urgent demands from the Security Council. It has taken into custody Arab passengers on international aircraft making unscheduled landings in Israel, holding them for long periods. And it has dispatched its saboteurs to civilian airports to destroy planes on the ground.\n188.\tAnd now, after this long record of terrorism- organized, planned and purposeful terrorism\u2014Israel raises its voice in righteous indignation against terrorism in an attempt to incite the world against the Palestinian people in its entirety, even though Palestinians are in truth the collective victims of Israel's own governmental terrorism.\n189.\tKuwait does not condone practices of terrorism, regardless of who is their perpetrator and who their victim. Kuwait regrets the shedding of innocent blood, whoever the victims may be, and grieves over the indiscriminate subjection of man, any man, to murder or agony or torture.\n190.\tHaving stated this, I must at the same time recall the fact that violence is alien to the character of the Palestinian people, whose history, both remote and recent, has manifested their humane virtues of tolerance, brotherhood,\\\" hospitality and generosity. Even if we put aside the remote past in an effort to avoid marshaling masses of details, it is sufficient to recall the recent past. The scene is one of a peaceful people, which finds itself exposed to an invasion air tied at nothing less than its displacement from its ancestral homeland, rising heroically to repel that invasion, waging for decades a battle of self-defense, with honor and dignity, and resisting every temptation to engage in indiscriminate violence.\n191.\tIf frustration and desperation, caused by its abandonment by the international community, have prompted some of its members to counter official Israeli terrorism with individual acts of terror, it would be unfair to hold the patient and struggling Palestinian people as a whole accountable for those acts.\n192.\tHowever, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument and I emphasize that it would be a completely false assumption that the whole Palestinian people had come to embrace terrorism as a program, we would nevertheless feel constrained to ask, is the international community entitled to expect those whom it has deprived of the protection of the law to abide by that law, or to expect those whom it has deprived of the blessings of public order to be concerned for the security of that order? Does the international community have the right to expect those to whom it has denied the opportunity to enjoy their inalienable, elementary rights to acknowledge obligations towards it? Does the United Nations have a right to expect from those with respect to whom it has betrayed the principles of its own Charter and whom it has relegated to a limbo outside the framework of the new world order which the United Nations was created in order to promote-does the United Nations have a right to expect from these people loyalty to that order?\n193.\tIt is anomalous that the tragedy suffered by the Palestinian people for a quarter of a century and directly affecting the life of every single Palestinian without exception should have no place on the agenda of the General Assembly while an item said to be inspired by certain actions performed by a few members of that people appears on the agenda. It is astonishing that the tragedy of the Palestinian people, to the creation and aggravation of which the United Nations has contributed, continues to be absent from the agenda of the General Assembly while some of the consequences of the desperation generated by that tragedy appear before it as an independent item.\n194.\tIs this because some believe that terrorism when perpetrated by individuals is worthy of arousing the concern of the United Nations, whereas systematic terrorism perpetrated by the government of the United Nations is not worthy of arousing the concern of the Organization? Or is it perhaps because the fate of two and three-quarter million Palestinians, victims of Zionist-Israeli terrorism, is less important in the view of some than the fate of a few dozen Israelis? Or is the explanation for the anomaly to which I have just alluded to be found, alternatively, in the fact that there are some who are aware of the events of the moment, but who forget or ignore the background of those events, even though it is of continuing reality and relevance? Or are there among us some who fancy that results can be effectively dealt with even when no effort is made to deal correctively with the causes which produced them?\n195.\tWhat the General Assembly is called upon to do, before proceeding to consider the question of contemporary terrorism, is to pause for some quiet reflection-bold, wise, judicious and impartial reflection. Bold reflection provides us all with the opportunity to exercise some badly-needed, harsh self-criticism, which alone can enable us to take congnizance of, and to correct, the mistakes, \nwhether of omission or of commission, made by the international community. Wise reflection enables us to view the events of the moment within the context of, and not in isolation from, their causes. Judicious reflection would not permit the treatment of effects to divert attention from the treatment of their causes. And impartial reflection refuses to equate the aberrations of a handful of deprived and desperate individuals with the sins committed formally by the government of a Member of the United Nations in accordance with carefully laid-out plans.\n196.\tOnly after a pause such as this and through such reflection can the General Assembly, and through it the international community as a whole, be true to the premise on which the Charter rests that there can be no peace without justice and find the path to true and durable peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my first and very pleasant duty is to congratulate you, on behalf of the Tanzanian delegation, on your unanimous election as President of-the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are convinced that your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and statesman constitute a valuable pledge for the success of this very important session. Our delegation would also like to place on record its appreciation of the able way in which the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Adam Malik, your distinguished predecessor, guided the deliberations of the last session.\n50.\tWe have read with interest the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/8701 and Add.l] and I would like to express, from the very outset, our appreciation for this report, which is a masterly presentation and appraisal of the developments in the international community during the past 12 months.\n51.\tLooking back over the annals of our Organization, the events of last year stand out remarkably as milestones on the road to the realization of the aims and purposes of the United Nations. I refer in particular to the reinstatement of the People's Republic of China in its seat in the United Nations and to the rest of the chain of events which have dramatically influenced the pattern of power both within the Organization and outside it.\n52.\tWith the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the Organization, the principle of universality was once more recognized in practice, and above all a sense of realism started to guide the foreign policies of many countries which had been till then Sinophobic. It was indeed inconceivable that world peace and justice could be achieved and maintained while the most populous, and one of the most important, countries in the world was excluded from this instrument of world peace and justice. We therefore once more welcome this long-overdue event and, while doing so, we hope that a complete realization of that principle of universality will continue to be our goal in this Organization.\n53.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly, we have witnessed a growing trend towards detente, particularly between the major Powers. We believe that the softening of hearts where there had been prolonged hostilities, and the adoption of a conciliatory spirit where there had been hard-and-fast differences, could pave the way to understanding and to peaceful solutions to the many problems that bedevil our planet. We welcome not only the detente between the big Powers, but also the rapprochement between the different parties in Korea, Germany and the Indian subcontinent.\n54.\tIn welcoming this process, my delegation would nevertheless echo the caution repeatedly expressed by the smaller nations, particularly those belonging to the non- aligned movement, that bilateral and other limited arrangements between the major Powers cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of this Organization. The improvement of relations among the big Powers is a necessary aspect of the efforts to bring about peace. Yet, any dealings among the major Powers that bypass the United Nations cannot accommodate the interests of all the Members of this Organization and cannot therefore guarantee a lasting peace. Durable peace and security must be worked out with the participation of all countries, big and small.\n55. The principle of collective responsibility and collective decision on the issues of peace and security in our world must equally be observed even if for one reason or another efforts towards international peace and security have to be undertaken outside the ambit of our Organization. Any attempt to evade this democratic procedure will inevitably be somewhat suspect. Indeed, while these bilateral agreements and understandings may serve the interests of the Powers concerned, they do not necessarily take into account the interests of the rest of the world community, notwithstanding representations to the contrary.\n56.\tYet, even if we assume that all the negotiations, some of them secret, that have taken place between the major Powers of the world have been conducted in the interest of our collective humanity, we must at the same time recognize that the process of active detente that we have witnessed over the period since the last session of the Assembly has not significantly lessened the threat to world peace and security. Thus, for example, while Europe has been witnessing a detente, tensions have been building up elsewhere in the world. Nor, for that matter, has the slight thaw in the frozen waters of the cold war of the 1960s and early 1970s appreciably reduced the misery and injustice under which millions of people in the world have so long suffered.\n57.\tThe war in Indochina continues to inflict disaster, misery and suffering on the people of that unhappy area. On 8 May, the President of the United States ordered the blockade of North Viet-Nam, and since then that small country has been subjected to some of the most destructive and barbaric bombings that have been experienced by any country since the time of Hiroshima.\n58.\tThe methods employed by the United States in its futile and senseless attempts to subjugate the Vietnamese people have no parallel in the history of warfare. Indeed, even some American news media sadly report that the people of North Vietnam are being bombed back to the stone age. This is both inhuman and outrageous. The present killings conducted by American naval and air forces in Vietnam are being undertaken, so it is said, to save the face and honor of the United States. But nothing would be more honorable than for the United States to order an immediate end to all the annihilation being carried out by the American forces in Viet-Nam.\n59.\tAn immediate end must also be put to the United States intervention in the affairs of Cambodia so that that traditionally non-aligned country can be allowed to pursue its progressive policies of peace and neutrality in complete freedom and security. Tanzania, in consonance with the position of many other non-aligned and peace-loving nations, wishes to reiterate its indignation at the continued aggression perpetrated by imperialism against the people of Indochina, and its full support of these heroic people who have demonstrated their strength, tenacity and perseverance in the struggle against gross injustice and bullying by the forces of reaction and international imperialism.\n60.\tThe highly explosive situation in the Middle East continues to preoccupy the attention of the international community. Few will challenge the fact that the status quo, apart from being a fragile and uneasy \\\"no peace, no war\\\" situation, also constitutes a gross betrayal of the Charter of the United Nations. Israel seems to be determined to flout with impunity decisions and resolutions of the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly. Since the General Assembly last addressed itself to the question there have been no positive changes in the situation. If anything, we have witnessed a further consolidation of Israeli conquests with concomitant repercussions affecting the possible peaceful solution of the conflict.\n61.\tThe question that arises now is no longer whether the international community can condone such arrogance and intransigence on the part of the occupying forces, but rather whether we can afford to be satisfied with mere moral condemnations. I wish to reiterate here the call my Government has made in the past both in this Organization and in other international forums. Israel must withdraw unconditionally from all the Arab territories that it now illegally occupies resulting from its 1967 war of aggression. It must also fully respect the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Only when it fulfills these conditions will there be hope for a durable peace in the Middle East.\n62.\tMy delegation has been very encouraged by the hopeful developments that have taken place in the Korean peninsula. While welcoming these encouraging developments, it is our conviction that, left to themselves, the Korean people are capable of solving their own problems in a brotherly and peaceful atmosphere.\n63.\tIt is the view of the Tanzanian delegation that it is now more necessary than ever before for this Organization to respond favorably to these developments by putting an end to all foreign intervention in Korea. Such a move will not only help to remove suspicions between the parties concerned but will also be a reassurance to them that the United Nations favors the methods of approach they have taken. We strongly call upon this Organization to withdraw its so-called military command from the area and to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. In particular, we call upon the United States to stop abusing the United Nations flag and to withdraw all its troops forthwith. The so-called military command serves neither any purpose useful to our Organization nor, for that matter, the interests of the Korean people. It is our sincere belief that the initiatives already taken by the Koreans themselves should receive the encouragement of our Organization. We therefore deeply regret that the General Assembly will not be addressing itself to the question in the current session.\n64.\tLet me now turn to the events which tragically continue to cause much suffering and misery in our continent.\n65.\tWith the exception of South Africa and Portugal, there is not a single country represented in this hall which has not, at one time or another, condemned colonialism. Yet colonialism continues to ravage vast areas of the world. This is the greatest tragedy of our time. It is, at the same time, the most obnoxious and pernicious scandal perpetrated by some Members of this Organization, particularly those Member countries which have the power to end this evil system.\n66.\tBut although the pace of decolonization is still painfully slow, we are conscious and appreciative of the role that the United Nations, through its Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, has played during the year. For the first time, a United Nations mission has had the opportunity to visit and to see the liberated areas of a colonial Territory in Africa. The visit is the more important because it was undertaken at the invitation of and conducted under the protection of the liberation movement of the Territory, the PAIGC,6 which has liberated those areas. The fact that this visit was successfully completed despite the sustained and intensified barbaric bombardments of those areas by the Portuguese Fascist forces can lead to only one conclusion for the United Nations, that is, the PAIGC exercises affective control over vast areas of Guinea (Bissau). The least, therefore, that the United Nations can do during the current session as a tribute to both the freedom, fighters in Guinea (Bissau) and the gallant young men who went on that mission, must be the reaffirmation of that fact. For our part and at this particular moment we pay our tribute to the worthy representatives of Ecuador, Mr. Sevilla-Boija; of Sweden, Mr. Lofgren; and of Tunisai, Mr. Belkhiria, and to the two members of the Secretariat. Mr. Nagata and Mr. Gaye, for a job well done. In this connexion, my delegation is happy to recall the fact -that our brother, Amflcar Cabral, Secretary General of PAIGC, rightly called these eminent sons of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, cosmonauts of decolonization.\n67.\tIt remains the duty of the United Nations now to implement the recommendations contained in the report of that Mission [Al8723lRev.l, chap. X, Annex I]; for the supreme significance of that Special Mission does not lie only in what it has seen, written, or said; it also lies in what the United Nations consequently does to help the victims of Portuguese Fascist oppression in Guinea (Bissau) an<^ Cape Verde.\n68.\tGuinea (Bissau) is but a part of the over-all colonial and racial situation prevailing in Africa today. It is part of that situation which not only oppresses the peoples in those colonial Territories but also affects very directly the domestic and foreign policies of our independent African States. To us, the colonial situation prevailing in Africa is the major determinant of our policies and is central in our daily lives. Consequently, we view it as the most burning issue before the United Nations.\n69.\tYet' it is the only issue which, given the will and honesty on the part of the leaders of this Organization assembled here, is capable of an immediate solution. Colonialism is not a natural or God-made disaster; it is man-made, man-maintained and, although strongly condemned publicly, in private it is condoned by some Members of this Organization. It is to these Members, particularly the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and several other Members within the NATO alliance, that we feel we must once again address our appeal to re-examine their policies in relation to the colonial situation in Africa. If the Governments of these countries agree, and indeed in public they do, that colonialism is an evil system because it is an attack upon our common humanity, then they must join with us in the fight against those forces and regimes which have chosen the maintenance and enforcement of colonialism as a way of life. Let them cease the supply of weapons to South Africa and Portugal weapons which systematically have been used against the African people in Angola, in Mozambique, in Guinea (Bissau), in Namibia and in Southern Rhodesia who have been and are fighting to make real the objectives of the United Nations, that is, the elimination of colonialism and racism.\n70.\tIn essence, the liberation struggle being waged in the colonial territories of Africa is only an extension of the struggle being waged by the United Nations. These people need and deserve the support, moral and material, of every honest and serious Member of this Organization.\n71.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly important developments have taken place in the colonial Territories of southern Africa. The African people in Southern Rhodesia, despite intimidation, arrests and banishments, have categorically rejected, the so-called proposals for a settlement agreed upon last year between the United Kingdom Government and the illegal minority regime of Ian Smith. To Africa this rejection was obvious from the very beginning. We saw no useful purpose whatsoever in the exercise of testing African opinion in that Territory on that issue, and we told the British Government so. Now that the Pearce Commission report  is out and the African voice has been heard, what does the United Kingdom Government propose to do next? And what does the United Nations propose to do during this session?\n72.\tLet us tell the United Kingdom Government in no uncertain terms that there is no need, none whatsoever, for so-called reflection by the Rhodesians. There is not the slightest possibility that the Africans in Southern Rhodesia will change their mind and the Pearce Commission makes this point quite clear. The report is also clear on the reasons given by Africans for opposing the proposals. Their opposition stems from the deep frustration and humiliation at the kind of life imposed on them by the white regime. And let us be frank, each and every one of us would react likewise if we were equally frustrated and humiliated.\n73\\^The United Kingdom Government thus has a clear course of action. It must act to assert its authority and change the present power structure in Rhodesia. The United Kingdom Government must act to ensure that there will be no independence in Southern Rhodesia before majority rule. To Africans in that Territory and to Africa as a whole no compromise will be acceptable.\n74.\tThe course of action for the United Nations is also very clear. The Organization must give every possible assistance to the liberation movements fighting in Southern Rhodesia. It is through this assistance that Southern Rhodesia will be saved from racial bloodshed.\n75.\tIt is most regrettable that one big Power, a permanent member of the Security Council, the United States of America, has chosen to strengthen the illegal racist minority regime of Ian Smith by importing chrome from Southern\nRhodesia in absolute contravention of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council against that Territory. What exactly is the explanation for that action? There is no doubt that that grave violation of the Security Council resolution by the United States of America serves to reinforce and strengthen the forces of racism and colonialism not only in Southern Rhodesia but in southern Africa as a whole.\n76.\tEqually regrettable actions by certain Western imperialist Powers are seen in the Territories under Portuguese domination. In those Territories, where the liberation struggle has been advancing very satisfactorily, certain of those Powers led by the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and others have been supplying the Government of Portugal with such deadly weapons as napalm, toxic gases, herbicide .defoliants and other chemical substances. Vast areas of these Territories have been destroyed, as have crops grown by African people, in the futile hope of starving the people into submission to slavery. There is perhaps no need to say more on the Territories under Portuguese domination since much has been said and written by the United Nations Special Mission that has visited some of those areas. It must, however, be stressed here that Africa considers those Powers which are aiding the white racist and colonialist regimes in southern Africa to be hostile to it.\n77.\tThere is one other important matter on which I wish to comment briefly. The Security Council has by its resolution 309 (1972), entrusted the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the task of finding new initiatives with all parties concerned in the Namibian question with a view to finding a solution to that question. There is no continent more anxious for a solution to the question of Namibia than Africa. We consider ourselves to be interested parties, not only because we are Africans and Namibia is an African territory, but also because, as Members of the United Nations, we fully accept that Namibia is the responsibility of the United Nations and is, therefore, our responsibility. Whatever solution is sought to the problem of Namibia must therefore be within the context of the decisions of the United Nations. Specifically, the solution must mean the termination of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African authorities. Furthermore, the phrase \\\"self-determination and independence\\\" must be in the context of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). We therefore hope that whatever initiatives the Secretary- General undertakes will not deviate from this position.\n78.\tLast year, at the twenty-sixth session, my delegation expressed the hope that with the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade in 1970 the developed nations would exhibit a new spirit of co-operation so as to find appropriate solutions to the problems of trade and development of the developing countries f 1951st meeting, para. 116]. At that time we placed high hopes in the third session of UNCTAD. That session is now over, and the story and catalog of the disappointments of the developing world not to mention the unfulfilled promises and unimplemented agreements have been eloquently ex-pressed by many eminent representatives of the developing countries in this and other forums and I need not, therefore, repeat them.\n79.\tThe gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, while the terms of trade continue to grow in favor of the developed countries at the expense of the poor nations. The flow of development finance has fallen far short of the target set in the first United Nations Development Decade. The burden of debt-servicing has not only become intolerable but has at times even retarded development by siphoning off national resources.\n80.\tThere is no doubt that the monetary system of the last two decades can no longer be effective. We believe that reform is necessary and required by both the developing and the developed countries. As developing nations we are entitled, as a matter of right, to insist that both now and in the future any reorganization of the world monetary system must be with our active participation and consent, because we believe that no reform could be satisfactory unless both the developed and the developing countries participated in the decision making. All countries of the world should in unison evolve a world system which seeks to serve all mankind, a system whereby there will be no senior and no junior partners, for we can no longer let decisions be handed down to us or let a few countries think and agree in the interest of the majority of mankind as though that were the monopoly of those few.\n81.\tThe historic United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held last June in Stockholm, made far- reaching decisions which, if implemented, could shape future environmental law which would save our earth from destruction. The Declaration of the Conference  was given the necessary balance by incorporating in it provisions on human rights, economic development and trade. For, as we stated in Stockholm, we cannot credibly talk of the environment without accepting basic conditions and rights by which man ought to live. For, after all, what is the purpose of the environment but man himself?\n82.\tFurthermore, the action plan for the human environment,  which envisages the setting up of an international body to co-ordinate activities in the field of the environment, has the support of my Government. We strongly believe that international cooperation is necessary if nations are to solve most environmental problems. In all this we wish to emphasize that immediate priority must be given to the needs of developing countries, whose major environmental concern is development, for development and the safeguarding of the environment are complementary.\n83.\tThis year, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament observed its tenth anniversary. Naturally, it is tempting for us to pause with the Conference to look back at the progress of our efforts towards general and complete disarmament. First we note that there is a list of so-called disarmament treaties: the Antarctic Treaty, the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, the Treaty of Tatelolco, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the treaties banning nuclear weapons in outer space and on the sea-bed and the recent convention outlawing biological weapons. And in May of this year the strategic arms limitation agreements were concluded in Moscow. On the face of it, nuclear weapons have been prohibited in all environments except underground. As far as the list goes, it all looks quite impressive. We call it a list of achievements. Let me state right away that we have no intention to belittle those efforts. We do admit that at least they indicate the acceptance in principle of the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament. Indeed, my country is a signatory to some of the agreements. However, I am impelled on this occasion to reiterate the position of my Government on this matter.\n84.\tFirst, it is clear, at least to my delegation, that all those treaties are half-hearted ancDonly peripheral. Instead of going to the root of the problem, they only nibble at its edge. They do not, for example, seek to destroy the existing stockpiles which alone are more than enough to wipe away the entire living world.\n85.\tSecondly, the importance of those treaties is often exaggerated. Those treaties tend to hide the reality of the existing perilous state of affairs. They are deceptive, and they lull us into complacency which; given the facts, we cannot afford. In the introduction to his report, the Secretary-General has this to say concerning the field of disarmament:\n\\\"The balance sheet of the first decade shows that the declared goal of general and complete disarmament has not yet been achieved. Neither has the arms race been halted nor perceptibly slowed down. In fact, the armaments race has spiraled to a level higher than ever before. For example, during the decade of the 1960s, the nations of the world poured a total of $1,870,000 million into- weapons of warfare; in recent years, total world expenditure for these purposes has risen to about $200,000 million annually.\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 3.J\nNor has nuclear testing ceased. Nuclear tests continue to be blasted underground and in the atmosphere, causing untold hazards to human life and peril to the entire race of mankind.\n86.\tIn restating the above position of my delegation, it has not been my intention to put the blame on the honorable work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. That Conference does not manufacture arms, nor has it as a Conference any interest in their production. Rather, it is the Powers concerned which are entirely responsible for this state of affairs. Had they the will to achieve any progress, the Conference would have no place to occupy, except perhaps as a co-ordinating device. Without that will on the part of those Powers, however, the Conference will continue to waste time and energy. Indeed, the fact is that all the major decisions in this field are made behind the back of the Conference.\n87.\tIn this connexion, my delegation would like once more to repeat that it is only by the full participation of the entire world community that meaningful discussions in matters affecting the whole of mankind can be undertaken. To that end we hope that a world disarmament conference, after proper preparations, will be held as soon as possible.\n88.\tLast year my delegation sponsored an item [item 98] aimed at the adoption of a declaration to demilitarize the Indian Ocean. After a very serious debate on the item, the General Assembly adopted a resolution which embodied a Declaration designating the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and called upon the great Powers, as well as the littoral States, to take the necessary steps to put into effect the provisions of the Declaration [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. That Declaration was in line with the Declaration adopted by a large group of non-aligned countries, among which were littoral States, assembled in Lusaka in 1970,  and reaffirmed at the meeting of foreign ministers of non-aligned States in New York in September of last year, and further reaffirmed at the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Georgetown, Guyana, in August of this year.\n89.\tMy delegation would like to reaffirm the position of a large number of developing countries that it is in the interest of peace in the various regions of the world that great-Power rivalry should be eliminated from those regions. To that end we demand that all foreign military bases be removed, not only from the territory of other nations, but also from the various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa and Latin America. We hope that the United Nations will continue to pursue this goal, and especially that it will take further action this year to promote the necessary efforts to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.\n90.\tTurning now to the question of the oceans, my country has followed with keen interest, and has participated actively in, the negotiations in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction since its establishment. We are pleased to note that the international community has on the whole accepted the fact that the present rules applicable to the marine environment are inadequate, inequitable and out of date. The Declaration of Principles adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)] is an historic landmark in this area, and my delegation wishes to reiterate its support for it.\n91.\tThe sea-bed Committee, which was enlarged in 1970 and given the mandate to prepare for a third conference on the law of the sea, has done commendable work, although it has been rather slow in some areas. The main issues have been identified, and the political negotiations have reached an advanced stage. Although there is a lot of work to be done, we believe that the international community is in a position to undertake negotiations at a higher level. The time is now ripe for the convocation of a law of the sea conference, and we support in principle the convocation of such a conference in 1973. What remains to be done in the sea-bed Committee can be done in one or two sessions before the conference is held.\n92.\tIn this connexion, we believe it is now time that a conference of this nature were convened in a developing country to enable the full participation and involvement of the developing world in the formulation of just rules of international law for ocean space. We therefore whole-heartedly welcome the invitation extended by the Government of Chile to hold one of the sessions of the conference in Santiago. The excellent services and congenial environment provided to the third session of UNCTAD highly commend Santiago.\n93.\tWe also welcome the invitation extended by the Government of Austria to hold some sessions of that conference in Vienna, a city whose traditional standing as a host of great international conferences is well known to all of us.\n94.\tAs we meet here for our twenty-seventh regular session, we are conscious of the fact that the eyes of the people of the world are focused on us. Our Organization has given great hopes to billions of people, but at the same time we must recognize that as a result of the acts of omission and commission on the part of some of its Members and the inability of the United Nations to take meaningful action due to obvious limitations, those hopes have at times been transformed into frustrations. It is incumbent upon all of us, not only for the sake of this great Organization, but above all in the interests of peace and security, to resolve to overcome these frustrations. We have both the means and the capacity to do so, provided that all of us rededicate ourselves to a determination to abide by the principles of the Charter and the decisions that we collectively take. Given that will, I am confident that the problems I have enunciated in my address, as well as many others, are not beyond solution.\n95.\tHumanity as a whole still looks to our Organization not only for its survival but indeed for its progress. Mankind is anxiously waiting to see us eliminate the many areas of conflict on our planet. The people of Africa are waiting with very high hopes for the freedom that they have been denied for so long. The hungry of the world are raising their hands to our Organization, hoping that international co-operation will one day afford every human soul at least two meals a day. In short, the world is anxiously waiting to see whether this session will be yet another platform for declarations of intentions or for a definite pledge of action.\n96.\tIt is by such a definite pledge to act that our session will ultimately be judged. And it is to all real and meaningful actions that my delegation would like to pledge its untiring support.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to convey to you the very warm congratulations of the Irish delegation on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n58.\tIn your inaugural address you stated that your country\n.. owes its existence, its freedom, its independence and its present dynamic development to great effort on the part of its people but also to tremendous sacrifices'\\\" [2032nd meeting, para. 55].\nHere I am reminded of an observation made by the Polish representative in the Security Council on 29 August 1946 in connexion with our application for admission to the United Nations. On that occasion Dr. Lange said that\n.. the people of Poland have always, throughout the whole history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, had a great sympathy and feeling of great and deep community with the people of Ireland\\\". \nThese are sentiments which are fully reciprocated by the Irish people. Consequently my delegation is most gratified that the presidency of the Assembly should be assumed by Poland, and we are particularly happy that this high office should devolve on a personality of your experience and competence. The proceedings over the past three weeks have demonstrated that you will discharge your functions in a manner calculated to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to enhance the standing of the Organization.\n59.\tI should like, too, to say how much my delegation welcomed the election last December of Mr. Waldheim to fill the office of Secretary-General. Naturally his long experience in the field of international affairs, both as representative of his country at the United Nations and elsewhere and as Foreign Minister, eminently fitted him to undertake the onerous duties of that office. In the intervening months we have admired the initiative and drive he has shown since assuming those functions.\n60.\tWe have in particular been gratified by the Secretary-General's determination to use the powers conferred on him by Article 99 of the Charter to call attention to serious situations and by the readiness he has shown to make himself available to help in resolving such situations. We sincerely hope that the international community will heed his advice and will take advantage of the services which he, as depositary of important responsibilities under the Charter and ideally placed to play a detached role, is so well qualified to render. My delegation much appreciates his offer to help in any way possible in connexion with the North of Ireland.\n61.\tWhen I spoke in this Assembly at the twenty-sixth session [1956th meeting] I said that we in Ireland believed that political and moral power grew not out of the barrel of a gun but out of the will of people to act together so as to translate values into facts. The United Nations was established for this purpose.\n62.\tMen of vision and goodwill felt that the old inter-national order of sovereign, independent States which had characterized the nineteenth century was no longer adequate. The social, economic and political realities of the modern world require that we achieve a saner and more balanced view of our relations with our neighbors, within national societies, and between nation and nation, and indeed a saner and more balanced relationship between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit.\n63.\tTo meet our individual and collective purposes we are constantly adapting structures and institutions or developing new ones. If the structures fail the fault may lie not in the institution itself but in the will of the national or the international community to make it work. As a structure, the United Nations, the Secretary-General reminds us in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, is \\\"not an independent sovereign organization but an association of sovereign Governments, and ... its failures are also their failures\\\". [A/8701/Add.l, p. 2.]\n64.\tThe ability of the Organization to succeed is primarily dependent on the will of its Members. I believe that, if one examines the Organization's work and achievements to date and, more importantly, its capacity to meet the needs of the contemporary international society, one must conclude that as a structure, while some adaptations and adjustments could profitably be undertaken, the United Nations remains adequate for the tasks which it has assumed. It is not the structure which is lacking. It is the will and commitment to make it work that must be continually reinforced.\n65.\tThe central political function of the United Nations, as the Secretary-General has recalled, is, in the words of the preamble to the Charter, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". We can do this by making the Organization an instrument of collective security. Although mankind has been spared the horror of a third world war, nevertheless we are all aware that the United Nations has been unable to act to end a series of bitter and long-drawn-out localized conflicts. However, its failure in this regard is not due to the weakness of the Organization itself but manifestly to the unwillingness of the parties to those conflicts to make use of the instruments of peace-making and peace-keeping which the United Nations has at its disposal.\n66.\tThis is the eighth regular session in which our agenda includes as an item \\\"Comprehensive review of the whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their aspects\\\" [item 41]. It is well known that the Irish delegation has long stressed the importance of this item, for it is obvious that situations can arise, and quite unexpectedly, in which the peace-keeping role of the international community is the most effective means of containing potentially explosive conflicts. Ireland consequently has contended that it is essential that the United Nations evolve a system, within the existing structure, by which a peace-keeping operation can be mounted at short notice and can be effectively pursued until it has achieved its purpose. We have always held that the establishment of a peace-keeping operation is primarily a matter for the Security Council, but we have contended equally that if the Council cannot take that step the residual authority of the Assembly should be capable of being invoked. Moreover, once an operation has been mounted, it is vital that its successful completion should not be jeopardized through the inadequacy of the method of financing it.\n67.\tMany previous speakers have referred to recent encouraging and hopeful developments in international and political relations the movement towards detente and dialog between the great Powers and between nations and States which are divided or dismembered by ideology or the fortunes of war. Ireland welcomes these developments, as we welcome, too, the movement towards full universality in this Organization, which gained enormous momentum last year when the People's Republic of China took its place among us. My delegation believes that Bangladesh should be a Member of the United Nations. For dialog, detente and universality must surely serve to strengthen the structure of the United Nations and strengthen both the confidence of the peoples in the Organization and their will to make it work.\n68.\tThe difficulties confronting national and international society are frequently more acute and more complex in the economic area. The United Nations, through UNCTAD, is engaged in what the distinguished Foreign Minister of France rightly called a \\\"great movement of solidarity\\\" [2041st meeting, para. 73].\n69.\tThe problems with which UNCTAD has to deal are numerous, delicate and difficult. They directly affect the well-being and livelihood of all the peoples of the world.\nThe relatively disappointing results of the third session of UNCTAD, which took place some months ago in Chile, should not, therefore, be allowed to weaken our determination to persevere. The session should not be judged solely in the light of its immediate or concrete results. It served to define more clearly the areas in which our efforts must be concentrated and has made the international community both more aware of what needs to be done and more alive to the need to do it. It also demonstrated that, while the many problems involved are interrelated, the best hope of success lies in attacking them individually rather than in trying to solve them all simultaneously.\n70.\tThe interplay of our will to act and the structures through which we can act in the political and economic spheres is also manifest in the complex relations between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit. There has been a growing realization in recent years of the importance of achieving a saner and more balanced view of the relations between man and the human environment. Piecemeal and uncoordinated development of industry, overpopulation, urbanization and rural depopulation, we now realize, can disturb, and have disturbed, the delicate balance between man and his ecological habitat. Resources have been depleted by rapacious exploitation; other resources have been destroyed by pollution and industrial waste; and many of the great cities of our civilization have been made barbarous by the refuse of mindless consumerism and planned obsolescence.\n71.\tThe recent success of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, is therefore a heartening sign. It is evidence of a growing realization of the gravity and complexity of the problems which world industrialization and urbanization have created and of a willingness to develop through the United Nations system a means of regulating growth and achieving and maintaining a proper equilibrium between the exploitation and conservation of the earth's resources. The tasks of the United Nations in this regard and its responsibility to succeeding generations are hardly less arduous and grave than those which it has assumed in its primary purpose of saving our children from the scourge of war.\n72.\tTwice in this century the clash of opposing national wills brought war to Europe. And the tragic lesson which war sometimes teaches and out of which the United Nations was born has a crucial relevance for Europeans. Those who had endured those terrible years had also reaped a new wisdom. The leaders of Europe realized that, if the continent was to avoid a further and perhaps final catastrophe, a profound transformation of European relations was necessary. National economic and political rivalries and dissension had to be replaced by co-operation and consensus.\n73.\tJust as the adoption of the United Nations Charter laid the foundation of a new world structure and order, the Treaty of Rome  laid the foundations of a new regional structure and order in which the peoples of Europe would assume obligations which bound them even more closely and committed them to work out together the common destiny to which both geography and history summoned them. In the years since 1957, when the Treaty of Rome was signed, the European Economic Community has undergone a process of evolution and development-which has been sometimes painful and often difficult but which, we are confident, is now about to repay the work, the tenacity and the vision of those men who labored to translate the ideal of European economic and political unity into a reality.\n74.\tSince I last addressed this Assembly the Irish people have expressed their overwhelming will to participate fully in the European Economic Community, which in a few months' time, with the accession of new member States, will group together some 250 million people. Ireland will bring its own heritage to this community of complementary cultures-which in Europe is endeavoring to build unity in diversity and, through co-operation and consensus, to guarantee to all our children that birthright of peace, of physical security, of material prosperity and of moral enrichment which should and can be the right of all mankind.\n75.\tOne paragraph in the speech made in this general debate by the United Kingdom Secretary of State struck me as being especially arresting. Speaking in the context of Europe about East-West relations, he said:\n\\\"We must face the facts even when they are unpleasant. Since the last World War the confrontation over the years between the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led to an almost total loss of confidence. Western Europe had no desire for this, but the fact is that neighborliness, once confidence is broken, cannot be recreated in a day.\\\" [2042nd meeting, para. 107.]\n76.\tThese remarks are, I feel, cogent in another context, that of Northern Ireland, and relevant to another relationship, that of my country and Great Britain. For the relationship between Britain and Ireland could not escape the influence of events in Northern Ireland over the past three or four years. These events have tended to reduce the problem there more and more to its most basic elements. The problem derives essentially from a conflict of political wills and is aggravated by a defective political structure.\n77.\tThe conflict of wills is that between Unionism and anti-Unionism, between those who seek to perpetuate a nakedly sectarian state in Northern Ireland-while pro-testing their loyalty and allegiance to Britain and British democracy-and those who are struggling for basic civil rights and substantial recognition of the legitimacy of their allegiance to the ideal of a united Ireland.\n78.\tNorthern Ireland was created as a political entity in order to provide an area in which to cater separately for unionism in Ireland. In the demographic and political circumstances of Ireland as a whole in 1920, when Northern Ireland was established, unionism could not-and cannot today-exist on its own. A purely Unionist area could not, and cannot, be established as viable. To cater for unionism therefore required the creation of an area divided into two communities with assured dominance for one. The structure of Northern Ireland, in consequences, had political instability built into it from the beginning. As a solution for the Anglo-Irish problem it was, in the words of my Prime Minister, \\\"a recipe for slow disaster\\\".\n79.\tA permanent peace and genuine democracy cannot be established until all the elements of the dilemma in Northern Ireland are squarely faced and dealt with together. And as I have said, the central dilemma of the North lies not only in a conflict of wills, but in the fact that this conflict of wills can never be resolved within the existing structure of Northern Ireland. A permanent solution therefore can only be found, in the view of my delegation, through a genuine attempt both to resolve the conflict of wills and to replace the existing structure.\n80.\tTo date, all the attempts by Britain and by successive Belfast administrations to bring about consensus government in Northern Ireland through reform have focused on only one element of the dilemma. In 1969 when the abuses which the divisions within the area had made virtually inevitable came to world attention Britain intervened to see to the reform of these abuses. Attempts at piecemeal reform and the violent refusal of the more reactionary Unionists to accept them brought no stability and the situation grew worse.\n81.\tMoreover the attempts at conciliation were accompanied by efforts to coerce the minority, which simply increased their alienation, and generated tolerance or support for violent tactics, and this in turn left the two communities in the North of Ireland even further divided than before. In short, these attempts to resolve the conflict of wills failed. Six months ago, in March, in the face of persistent violence and instability, Britain took the more drastic step of suspending the structures of dominance within the area by proroguing the Northern Parliament in an effort to reassemble the shattered pieces of the structure in a more equitable and stable way. But what Britain has to face is that the very structure of Northern Ireland the unworkable attempt to create an area to deal separately with unionism in Ireland is the fundamental difficulty and that there is no way in which the pieces can be put together again so as to have permanent stability within a purely Northern Ireland setting. If a successful political structure is to be built, it must be one which is open to, and capable of, operating in a wider context, that of Ireland as a whole.\n82.\tBut the conflict of wills must also be faced. Britain and Ireland together with the divided communities in the North will have to be involved in the resolution of that conflict. The deepest concerns of the Unionist community in Ireland will have to be, and can be, met by an eventual accommodation with the national majority by negotiation and on terms acceptable to both. And the deepest concerns and desires of the Unionist community in Ireland cannot be met any other way-certainly not by coercion or by the inter-communal violence who threatens all Irishmen with common ruin.\n83.\tIt is evident that there can be no instant solution to the present difficulties. Short-term measures alone, based on a simple balance of forces within the area, will not be enough.\n84.\tThere is general acceptance at present of the need to provide a new framework for administration in the North of Ireland. This administration must provide for an equitable division of political power between the elected representatives of the communities in the area, and there must be no possibility of the abuse of security powers in the interests of one community. Beyond this, there must be recognition of, and a real political outlet for, the legitimate aspirations of the non-Unionist community.\n85.\tInterim measures can allow a process of reconciliation to begin: membership by Britain and both parts of Ireland in the European Community will undoubtedly help. But the process of reconciliation will advance only if there is an acceptance of the need to promote and work positively towards a stable and lasting settlement on a new basis in Ireland. It is not enough simply to speak of this as a \\\"legitimate aspiration\\\", or to suggest that reconciliation, now, is a prerequisite to any progress towards this aim. If a real and lasting process of reconciliation is to begin now, there must be courageous and far-sighted policy decisions aimed at such a settlement, and there must be provision for movement towards it as the opportunities become available.\n86.\tIn brief, the aim must be not merely to hope for but to encourage actively, by every available political means, progress towards a new Ireland. It would clearly be wrong to repeat on a larger scale in the island as a whole a pattern which has already proved unstable in the North. So we must try to achieve, by agreement, new political institutions in Ireland which do not divide its communities or subordinate one to another, but which are responsive to all elements of its population and their diversity of outlook and tradition. A beginning must be made now which will promote and encourage progress in the right direction, but it would be unwise to demand absolutes, or to set a rigid time-table.\n87.\tIn speaking to the General Assembly as I have done on tills issue, which deeply troubles us in Ireland, I should like to emphasize that my Government does not consider that the interests of the national majority in Ireland are in any way at variance with the real, long-term interests of the Unionist community. Nor are the interests of the Irish people in conflict with those of the British people. We consider that a stable and lasting settlement in Ireland on the basis I have outlined is in the real interest of both, and we believe and hope that the British Government will come to see this, if indeed it has not begun to do so already.\n88.\tOver the past year there have been exchanges of view between the British and Irish Governments on the mutual problem of Northern Ireland. The situation there and the approach to it I have outlined require deep involvement by both Governments.\n89.\tThe Irish Government, for its part, is fully prepared to play a constructive role in reaching a just and lasting settlement of this last difficult problem in Anglo-Irish relations. It will act, by every constitutional means open to it, to work towards a reasoned political settlement, because it believes such a settlement would be clearly in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland, of both the British and Irish Governments, and of all the people of both islands.\n90.\tSir Edward CAKOBAU (Fiji): Mr. President, it gives me much pleasure to add my delegation's congratulations to the many you have already received on your unanimous election as the President of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your wise and able guidance the work of the session will be successfully concluded.\n91.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to pay my delegation's tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, who guided the deliberations of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly with such great distinction.\n92.\tMay I also congratulate our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on his appointment to his high office. His ability was already well known and his dedicated and wise leadership since assuming office is ample evidence that our trust and good judgment in appointing him have not been misplaced.\n93.\tFiji would particularly wish to commend the Secretary-General for the many personal initiatives he has taken on matters of international concern. I should like to reassure him of Fiji's continued co-operation and support.\n94.\tI welcome the privilege and the honor of addressing this Assembly. I particularly welcome the opportunity of speaking to you about developments in my part of the world, an area which does not often feature in international news but where there is quiet progress along new courses. I also welcome the opportunity to comment from the South Pacific viewpoint on the events of the past year and on the work of the United Nations.\n95.\tThe past year has been unusually eventful. On the one hand we have seen the outbreak of renewed violence both between and within nations. We have seen continuing conflicts unnecessarily costing many lives. We have seen the wasteful and destructive diversion of wealth and resources to the purposes of war when, increasingly, the people of the world need their rational and constructive deployment for peaceful ends.\n96.\tIn the same year, we have, on the other hand, seen important initiatives taken towards easing the tensions which cause these conflicts. The various bilateral meetings which the leaders of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and Japan have recently held have already yielded encouraging results.\n97.\tWe welcome the moves made by the opposing wings of divided nations to achieve through dialog some relaxation of the tensions which otherwise can have calamitous consequences for the peoples concerned and for the rest of the world.\n98.\tThe agreements reached between West and East Germany, and between West Germany and Poland, are pleasing developments. Another is the dialog between the two Koreas. We are pleased that this Assembly, in its \\\"wisdom, has respected the wish of the Korean people to be left alone to work out their own reunification. Removed from the spotlight of international attention and shielded from interference, encouraging progress has been made in their bilateral talks. We trust that by our next session even greater progress will have been reported. Indeed, we hope for an end of the mistrust and bitterness which have divided Korea and its people for more than two decades.\n99.\tIt is significant that these peaceful and constructive developments have taken place outside the aegis of this Organization, We are convinced that the United Nations pan at times best serve the cause of world peace and security by not venturing into areas where its intervention may not be helpful.\n100.\tThere are occasions, however, when the Organization must intervene, and indeed has a bounden duty to act, in the interest of international peace and security. It is a source of regret to us all that, despite some hopeful developments, the last year has given little evidence of the ability of the Security Council to discharge more effectively its primary responsibility, the maintenance of peace and security.\n101.\tFiji assumed its place in this Assembly in the sincere belief that all countries, large and small, have a role to play in promoting the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that, given goodwill, tolerance and understanding, all countries can, through this Organization, contribute effectively to the promotion of world peace and security. It is unfortunate that the exercise of a veto in the Security Council can so easily bring to nought the efforts of this Organization.\n102.\tIt may well be that the question of Security Council membership, both permanent and elected, and the power of veto which lies with permanent members, could benefit from a thorough reappraisal with the object of re-establishing the effectiveness and credibility of this most important organ of the United Nations. We are encouraged that during this current debate other speakers have also ex-pressed a similar view.\n103.\tMy Government is gravely concerned at the recent upsurge of terrorism and senseless violence which endangers the lives of innocent persons. There can be little justification for international terrorism. It disturbs the very fabric of international peace and good order. My Government therefore commends the initiative of the Secretary-General in bringing this matter to the attention of this Assembly for its urgent consideration [A/8791 and Add.l]. We would support any internationally agreed preventive measures designed to protect especially the lives of innocent people.\n104.\tIn the economic and social sphere, Fiji as a developing country is deeply grateful for the valuable assistance which we receive from the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Fiji is glad to receive international aid where it is given on the basis of mutual respect and equality. We do not, however, welcome aid that seeks to impose conditions incompatible with our sovereignty. I should like to emphasize that, although we seek and welcome aid, we ourselves realize that for our own development we must depend ultimately on our own resources and efforts.\n105.\tLike most developing countries, Fiji has a development plan for the improvement of the quality of life of its people. In this, our primary aim has been to encourage and accelerate the social and economic development of the less favored sections of our community, and in particular those who live in rural areas. One of our tasks is to bring home to those who enjoy economic advantages that it is in their interests to do everything possible to encourage and accelerate the development of those who are less fortunate.\n106.\tIn a wider context, we believe that only a decisive and combined effort by both developed and developing countries will make it possible to eliminate widespread conditions of poverty and the disparity between the rich and the poor. And it is only by bridging the gap between the great prosperity of the few and the poverty of the many that we can build a firm foundation for lasting peace and international security.\n107.\tFiji welcomed the opportunity to participate in the third session of UNCTAD. The past year has seen increased activity on the part of developed countries in the preparation and promulgation of their general non-reciprocal preference schemes. In Santiago, however, the developed countries showed no great support for the developing nations' urgent appeals for new initiatives. This must be a matter of common concern to all, both developing and developed countries.\n108: One wonders about the developed countries. They pay lip-service to the need to bridge the gap between themselves and the developing countries; and yet at international conferences they do not hesitate to thwart proposals put forward by developing countries where these run counter to their vested interests. Such negative attitudes are reprehensible and in direct opposition to the ideals of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n109.\tThe problem that all developing countries face in maintaining their export markets in developed countries is crucial. It has assumed a new sense of urgency for Fiji with the background of low prices for primary products and the changing pattern of economic relationships in the developed world. Fiji depends on sugar and copra for about 75 per cent of its visible export earnings, and half of its sugar production has been sent for many years to the United Kingdom under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21 December 1951. The coming negotiations with the European Economic Community are thus of particular concern to us. It is our hope that the highly developed countries in that Community will appreciate our problem and will not require us to make far-reaching adjustments in our economic relationships, particularly with our neighboring countries in the South Pacific, as the price of continuing access to the British market in an enlarged European Economic Community.\n110.\tThe last occasion on which I was present at the United Nations was only a few years ago, in 1966, before Fiji became independent, when my country was the subject of review by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is a particular pleasure, therefore, to be able to view the work of the Special Committee from a very different perspective, that of an independent member contributing to its counsels from its own very recent experience of evolutionary constitutional change. I should like to commend the realistic, constructive, and vigorous way in which the Special Committee is dealing with the question of the remaining colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories. Many of the remaining Territories with which the Special Committee is concerned are in our part of the world. We have been particularly satisfied with the progress made towards self-determination in the neighboring Territories of Papua New Guinea and Niue and the Tokelau Islands. It is our hope that the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, at present under the trusteeship of the United States, will also be able to resolve its difficulties in accordance with the wishes of its inhabitants.\n111.\tProgress has been regrettably slow in the remaining African Territories with which the Special Committee is concerned. The question of Namibia is still unsolved. The important personal contact made by the Secretary-General with the Government of South Africa, and the recent appointment of the Secretary-General's representative regarding Namibia, will, we trust, open the way for the achievement of self-determination and independence by the peoples of that Territory.\n112.\tIn Rhodesia, the Pearce Commission in its report has recorded the wish of the people to reject the terms of a settlement negotiated between the British Government and the illegal Smith regime. Fiji accepts the findings of that Commission and is hopeful that a compromise, acceptable to all, may yet be achieved. In this regard, Fiji supports the call for a constitutional conference with equitable representation of all the Rhodesian people. We appeal to all the parties concerned to give the matter their most urgent attention, and warn against the danger of relaxing efforts to find a speedy solution to the problem.\n113.\tI turn now to the Portuguese Territories. We are concerned that no significant progress has been made in their decolonization and deplore the violent measures used by the Portuguese authorities to repress the legitimate aspirations of their colonial peoples. We strongly urge the Portuguese authorities to cease all hostilities and to hasten decolonization processes in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).\n114.\tA sphere of activity where years of preparation have begun to show results is that of the environment. Although Fiji is relatively free of the major forms of pollution which threaten the developed world, we are confronted with environmental problems arising from our lack of development and, in common with many other developing countries, we stressed at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm, and do so again now, that the special needs of developing countries should be kept clearly in view and should not be submerged in any campaign for environmental perfectionism which, however well-intentioned, the developing countries simply cannot afford.\n115.\tA more immediate issue for an oceanic State like Fiji, which has always been dependent for sustenance on the resources of the sea, is the work of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. Assured control over coastal marine resources and inter-national agreement on a regime for the high seas are of crucial importance. We have been in close consultation with members of the sea-bed Committee whose interests are similar to our own. We are hopeful that we shall be able to formulate principles to define the concept of an oceanic archipelago' which will be acceptable to the international community and enable it to recognize our special position and our special needs.\n116.\tAlthough progress in the sea-bed Committee has sometimes been painfully slow, there is gratifying agreement on the comprehensive list of subjects and issues relating to the law of the sea [A/8721, para. 23] and on the preparatory work required for drawing up an international regime. Fiji believes that, given the political will and a spirit of co-operation and mutual accommodation among its members, the Committee will make more rapid progress during its sessions in 1973. It is with this expectation that my Government favors the convening of the third conference on the law of the sea at an early date and shares the view expressed by many delegations in the sea-bed Committee that the conference should begin its first session at the end of 1973.\n117.\tA subject closely allied to the questions of inter-national security, the environment and the law of the sea to which 1 have already referred is that of nuclear testing. Ever since Fiji has had the opportunity of making its voice heard in the international community, it has protested the carrying out of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and particularly the atmosphere of the Pacific Ocean. It is a source of great regret that I must record that those protests, which have been echoed by many of our friends in this Assembly, and notably during this session by my colleagues from Australia and New Zealand, have gone unheeded. This year France has again exploded a number of nuclear devices on Mururoa atoll.\n118.\tWe are assured that these tests produce little radiation. They are said to be harmless. That being so, many countries in Fiji's part of the world question why France needs to conduct them at a point on the earth's surface which is as far removed as possible from the mass of its own territory and population.\n119.\tThe tests are contrary to the terms of the partial test-ban Treaty,  to which the vast majority of the Members of this Organization, including Fiji, have sub-scribed. It is true that France is not a party to that Treaty and that there are other countries which also continue to test in the atmosphere. At a time when wider agreements are being sought for complete disarmament and for the cessation of all nuclear testing, the activities of countries which persist in testing nuclear devices in the atmosphere must be repugnant to the international community as a whole. We will not relax our efforts, in concert with other like-minded nations, to persuade those responsible to bring their programs of destruction to an end. In this regard we strongly support and commend an initiative jointly taken by our neighbors Australia and New Zealand to bring the question of nuclear testing before this Assembly [A/8741] with a view to banning all such activity, especially in the South Pacific.\n120.\tThe questions of race and racial and other forms of discrimination continue to be a major source of friction and confrontation. This Assembly has, by a Universal Declaration and by conventions, a distinguished record of activity in trying to overcome these evils. Still the problems remain. Still we see the institutional entrenchment of racial segregation, and some countries continue to apply discriminatory policies which are condemned by the international community. These policies give cause for particular concern because they threaten international peace and security. Such policies will inevitably yield before the rising tide of international opinion and the resentment of those who are made to suffer. Still we are faced with new examples of intolerance, deportations and other forms of persecution. In whatever form their perpetrators may attempt to present them to themselves and to the world, these policies find their roots in racial resentment and the inability of man to come to terms with the dissimilarities of man. Let us not be guilty of double standards, but be ready to condemn this evil wherever if may appear.\n121.\tAs a member of the Commonwealth of Nations which tries to uphold the ideal of non-racialism, Fiji finds racial discrimination abhorrent not only where it is practiced by whites, as in southern Africa and elsewhere, but also where it is used by others to distinguish unfavorably those of different ethnic origins. In this connexion we should like to record our appreciation of the efforts being made by the Secretary-General and others to alleviate the sufferings of the Asians expelled from Uganda, and we hope that those efforts will be successful.\n122.\tTo us in Fiji race is a fact of everyday life. We have a multiracial community, composed largely of people of Indian origin and of indigenous Fijians, but with substantial minorities of Europeans, Chinese and other Pacific islanders. But we are striving to build a non-racial community. I believe that the lessons we have learned in our own society, which have led us to a more creative attitude to the differences which exist between us, could have some value in the wider context of international relations.\n123.\tLike my colleagues the Foreign Ministers of Australia and New Zealand, who have spoken, earlier in this debate, [2042nd and 2045th meetings, respectively], I wish to mention the South Pacific Forum. Since Fiji's independence in 1970, there has been a growth in South Pacific regionalism. Only a little over a year ago the first meeting of the South Pacific Forum took place in New Zealand. It was a historic but still tentative and exploratory meeting of the leaders of seven countries in the South Pacific. It was called to answer the need of small newly independent island nations to reach out beyond the confines of their own shores to share the common experience of government. It also helped to meet the wish of our friends in New Zealand and Australia to establish a new, post-colonial relationship. The first meeting led to the second meeting of the Forum in Canberra in February this year.\n124.\tFrom these beginnings the South Pacific Forum has gained in strength and stature. We in Fiji were proud to have had the privilege of hosting the third meeting of the Forum in Suva a few weeks ago. This meeting marked the full emergence of this new institution in the region it is designed to serve.\n125.\tThe meetings of the heads of government are friendly, frank and informal, and range over many common problems. The desire to turn ideals into practice is shown by the establishment of the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation, which will promote intra-regional trade among the islands and trade between them and their neighbors in the Pacific basin, and will facilitate new forms of regional economic co-operation in such areas as shipping, tourism and manufacturing.\n126.\tJust as we in Fiji are discovering anew the spirit of co-operation and mutual assistance in our own region, so we continue to seek it in this world Organization, to which we belong. I have pointed to what we regard as some of its shortcomings, but disappointments do not justify indifference or the tendency of some to regard the United Nations as irrelevant.\n127.\tSince 1945, and more particularly since 1955, many new and smaller nations have emerged and gained dignity through their membership in the United Nations. The voices they raise may not individually have been strong, but collectively they have been an influence for right and good. They have spoken out for small peoples and against tyranny and oppression. They are in the vanguard against racialism and colonialism, oppression and militarism.\n128.\tIt is true that the United Nations was unable to avert the tragedies of the Koreas, Bangladesh and Viet-Nam, but it has tempered the suffering through the help of its agencies.\n129.\tAt a time when man has reached out and expired the surface of the moon and now moves on to other planets, surely it is not beyond his ability to look at the United Nations, recognize the new circumstances that have arisen since its birth and, using the goodwill it has engendered, fashion from it an instrument for world peace and service.\n"

        "file_text": "We are gratified to see that you, Sir, have been appointed President of the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly. You represent a noble country known for its heroic deeds and its fascinating history, Poland, which for so many reasons deserves universal respect.\n160.\tIt is a highly significant coincidence that you succeed Mr. Adam Malik of the Republic of Indonesia, a distinguished and outstanding statesman who also represented a heroic and noble country which achieved its integration and freedom through a decisive struggle for these lofty national values.\n161.\tBoth of you remind us of one of the outstanding responsibilities of this Organization in the world of today. When efficiency and magnitude seem to coincide with the need felt by great interests to minimize the meaning of frontiers as an obstruction, our Organization should try to ensure that these frontiers maintain their most significant value: that people need not sacrifice their sons for the world to recognize their right to individuality, to self- determination in terms of their own will and to the free expression of it; for all to participate in deciding and forging the common good; and for all to possess and enjoy fully the heritage which is rightfully theirs by nature and in terms of the mandate of international equity.\n162.\tWe also wish to convey our congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose enlightened talent and devotion to the United Nations are singularly outstanding. What could be termed activity and fervor in Trygve Lie, heroism and abnegation in Dag Hammarskjold, caution and foresight in U Thant, is pragmatic and corrective flexibility in Kurt Waldheim.\n163.\tMr. Waldheim's energetic administrative ability leads us to trust that the financial difficulties of the United Nations will be solved and the root-causes of them will be dealt with, not merely adjusted in their effects. His high-level policy, which is very much in accord with that of personal contacts to which the great statesmen and world leaders have had recourse with such promising success during this second half of the twentieth century, should be viewed as a happy augury for the strengthening of the deliberative capacity of our Organization, since what the United Nations Secretary-General represents will be all the more meaningful and important the more he is identified with the aspirations of peoples expressed here by their lawful delegations.\n164.\tAlthough on some previous occasions I have had the honor of addressing the Assembly, this is the first time that I do so as the representative of a bipartisan Government in my country headed by a National Government Junta. On the decision of the National Constituent Assembly, the Junta began to govern the destinies of Nicaragua on 1 May 1972, at the end of the period for which General Anastasio Somoza was elected by popular vote.\n165.\tThe National Government Junta, made up of General Roberto Martinez Lacayo, Mr. Fernando Ag\u00dcero Rocha and Mr. Alfonso Lovo Cordero, represents the union of the two largest political blocs in our country, and that body brings together the broadest majority which could support a government in Nicaragua, and they have joined their wills to promote greater national progress through the civilized means of law, peace and labour.\n166.\tIn repeating, on behalf of the National Government Junta, this devotion to peace and justice, nothing gives me more satisfaction than to be able to do so using the very same words as our predecessor in the Government. When President Anastasio Somoza addressed this Assembly in 1970. he said the following:\n\\\"Nicaragua reiterates and renews its faith in the United Nations. Nicaragua, a country that loves peace, that respects the rights of others, applies norms of international conduct in conformity with the law, and is proud to follow a policy that complies with the Charter of this world Organization. In keeping with these principles, we have peacefully settled our conflicts in the past and scrupulously complied with the decisions of the International Court of Justice. In accordance with the fundamental principles of our political constitution, we have established respect for human rights and for the principle of the self-determination of peoples, and we have proscribed war as an instrument of justice.\\\" [1881st meeting, para. 156.]\n167.\tThis philosophy has been the link which has joined together all the administrations of the past 40 years, ever since, at the beginning of the 1930s, Nicaragua decided gradually to strengthen by means of peace and concord its sovereignty as a free nation of the world and its domestic progress based on free enterprise and equitable participation. The same philosophy governs the competitiveness and social responsibility of its private enterprise, the moderation and good judgment of its labor organizations, the respect for the law and public service demonstrated by its armed forces, and the admirable support for civilized means of action felt by the vast majority of its people.\n168.\tThe National Government Junta represents the flowering of this heritage of enlightened civil understanding, a lively and calm will for peaceful transformation, described by us as the most encouraging political phenomenon we have achieved, and one which will enable the nation to continue its tradition of peace and law so that the twentieth century may open the door to hope for the future.\n169.\tWith this deep-rooted conviction of the importance and stability of what I represent, I shall venture to explain the general lines of the policies which the National Government Junta of my country wishes to bring to this august Assembly.\n170.\tWith the principle that \\\"development is the new name for peace\\\", Pope John XXIII launched his militant ecumenical message for all men of goodwill. His scheme for economic and social development cannot be conceived without a national order which reveals distributive justice as the foundation of the development of the human person. The second element in this scheme for development is that development cannot be imposed by the criteria of one sector, nor be the subject of secret or dogmatic decisions; on the contrary, it must be the responsibility of human reason in which all the sectors concerned must receive the full impact of the representative democracy of a civil government.\n171.\tBut this concept of development also implies a framework of international justice, which will make it possible for it to be carried out. It would serve little to impose on States the responsibility to promote the development of its citizens in an internal order of equitable participation in the benefits of labor; it would serve little to bring about the transformation, even the peaceful transformation, of internal institutions if the energies of the universal movements of the spirit were not to make themselves responsible also for the creation of an international order which ensures that the necessary and sufficient conditions exist so that the heritage of nature, where labor must function, and the patrimony of civilization and culture, with which labor is performed, are equitably distributed among the peoples.\n172.\tThe corner-stone of any order should be to ensure the fundamental freedoms and rights of the human person, enabling States to make them effective.\n173.\tTo be free from hunger, poverty, disease and ignorance is a fundamental and inherent right of the human person throughout the planet. But hunger, poverty, disease and ignorance are not self-generated by peoples\u2014at least not by those who do not have the right or the possibility of self-determination to avoid them.\n174.\tIt is essential for States to have not only an equitable participation in the fruits of nature and the resources of civilization, but also the security of self-determination so that international trade will not put a brake on the achievement of their fundamental freedoms and rights but will stimulate the effective co-operation and solidarity which will make these possible.\n175.\tThe thesis of the legal equality of States is upheld by the principle of self-determination and the outlawing of means of violence as a tool of international policy. If one of the first fundamental conditions is lacking, it is not possible to ensure the purity of the results, therefore an international order that is not founded on these concepts is historically untenable. For such reasons the National Government Junta of Nicaragua has decisively supported from the outset the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to include in the agenda for this session the item on international terrorism.\n176.\tFor many years now Nicaragua has firmly condemned all forms of violence. The Nicaraguan Government has paid increasing attention to the problem of international terrorism since this is a manifestation of the use of violence in relations between peoples which can only have a negative impact on international peace and security and an adverse effect on all other normal relations between nations.\n177.\tWitliin a State citizens have the right to institutionalize the means which will ensure for them the exercise of their freedom of expression. In the international order this right should be extended to States and groups of human beings so that they can manifest their free will through rational means worthy of the civilization which we so proudly regard as our own.\nJ\n178.\tThe Government of Nicaragua, with the broad and decisive support of its citizens, has condemned violence, including terrorism, as a means of expression and political action within the frontiers of the country. We have always considered it our legal obligation to ensure for our citizens all the peaceful forms of expressing approval or disagree \nment, because this maintains internal peace and the evolution of our institutions, as minimum essential conditions for a development policy.\n179.\tIt has been and will continue to be the official policy of the Government of Nicaragua to cope with any violent situation, including terrorism, with the normal means of safeguarding public order, including punishments by recourse to common law which are consecrated by traditional practice and which are rooted in the principles of morality of our people.\n180.\tNicaragua deeply regrets that in some countries and, certain regions of the world there has been a resurgence of the tragedy of terrorism. Our people and Government share the concern of other countries to find an adequate solution and we most firmly support the thesis that attention to this problem cannot be delayed. To discuss economic, social, political or any other form of relations has no meaning if we are not first certain that these relations can be decided upon and put into practice in an order free from terror. This is the essential prerequisite for free participation. Convinced of the urgency of this item and the high priority it deserves, the Government of my country is none the less aware of the difficulties that its solution presents at the international level.\n181.\tA great deal of wisdom will have to be brought to bear not only in the study of the causes of terrorism but also in foreseeing the effects of the measures which may be decided upon to combat it. Urgency should not lead us to undue haste.\n182.\tThe essential prerequisite is to strengthen internal conditions which will ensure freedom of expression for citizens, as well as an international climate which at this stage of internationalization will ensure equal freedom for every State or human group. But the international responsibility of States cannot be made so extreme as to jeopardize the legal equality among them or to make unjust international coercion a means to suppress a just human aspiration.\n183.\tThe National Government Junta of Nicaragua considers it indispensable in this connexion to ensure that an institution such as the right of asylum, which is considered to be so equitable by the peoples of Latin America, should not be undermined since it is one of the safest practices to enable man to preserve and exercise his political rights. Beyond question, we consider the right of asylum should be not only maintained, but strengthened so that it is not used as an accomplice to acts which are repugnant to morality and contrary to the legal order.\n184.\tThe foregoing is completely in line with the traditions and practices of the inter-American community, to whose ideals the National Government Junta restates its devotion and its determination' to strengthen them by all means within its scope.\n185.\tLatin America cannot forget, nor does it forget what was achieved in the nineteenth century when it freed itself completely from the colonial ties which bound its destinies to the will of certain European States. This gesture has been many times repeated since the end of the Second World War, when hundreds of millions of men of other continents succeeded in organizing themselves in scores of States, whose voice today swells the voice of freedom within this great world Organization. But neither can it forget what it had to suffer and go through before, during and after this task of emancipation, because of an international law and practices had been established not to strengthen the possibilities of freedom for peoples but, rather, to foster more or less deliberate schemes of colonization.\n186.\tAccordingly, since the dawn of its independent life it has expressed itself firmly among the Latin American countries for a spirit of renovation of international law and practice to make them more compatible with the evolution of the just aspirations of peoples, which should find in international law the best safeguard of these aspirations, as the only means of escaping the deadly, vicious circle of violence.\n187.\tOne of the manifestations of this Latin American tendency has been to establish institutions and promote principles which foster freedom for the human person and international co-operation and solidarity and to give the law and practices among States fundamental objective criteria which lessen the importance of procedural formalities and the subjectivism to which so much recourse was had under ancient law, to the detriment of justified aspirations.\n188.\tWith these efforts to make the law objective, revising, readjusting and correcting it, which are so encouragingly characteristic of the peoples of our America, the Government and people of Nicaragua for many years have been deeply identified, and now, on behalf of the National Government Junta, I am pleased to repeat and reiterate our traditional and enthusiastic identification with them.\n189.\tWe human beings have used the land, the sea and the air to establish common ties of relationship to the extent that technology has made it possible to make use of them, and civilization has given some purpose and meaning to their use. On land, on the sea and in the air are written the value and importance of our virtues and the history of our defects and passions. Yet we must confess that in each one of these elements human reason has left indelible traces of its lofty designs and its irreversible course of progress.\n190.\tSince Nicaragua is geographically a-maritime country, with two oceans and vast water resources which constitute the largest portion of its national patrimony, its statesmen and people have paid increasing attention to the future of its water resources policy.\n191.\tWe feel particularly close to all the countries of the Caribbean region, almost all of which are characterized by the limited size of their land and by the relative scarcity of natural resources on that land.\n192.\tAnd it is therefore to be understood as natural that we have a common interest in studying the tendencies in the world community as regards recognition of the vital rights we have in the peaceful and rational use of the resources of the continental shelf and the adjacent seas, which is a fair and, for that matter, rational compensation for the limitations imposed upon us by the limited area of land and our peaceful vocation as States.\n193.\tMay I be permitted to restate here the firm decision of the National Government Junta and the people of Nicaragua to maintain their support for peaceful and civilized forms of international relations, to contribute by all possible means to making international law objective and readjusting it so that it will ensure to all peoples that their vital heritage is not unduly and unfairly affected, and to participate to the extent that circumstances permit in the enrichment of international relations within principles of equity and common well-being.\n194.\tNicaragua has identified itself with the countries which are trying, through a wise law of the sea, to strengthen the peaceful aspirations of mankind and the possibility for peoples to use marine resources equitably to finance their development.\n195.\tNicaragua joined with its brother countries of Latin America very early to initiate formally the movement, which is now universal, to readjust and reform the law of the sea which was started to deal with the resources of the sea for a distance not less than 200 miles from the coast, and the renewable and non-renewable resources of the total area of the continental shelf under the old concept of territoriality. From theory we went to practice. In view of our geographic location and the peculiar nature of our submarine zones, in 1950 we included the following article as Article 5 in our Political Constitution:\n\\\"The national territory extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and from the Republic of Honduras to the Republic of Costa Rica. It includes, in addition: the adjacent islands, the subsoil, the territorial waters, the continental shelf, the submerged lands, the air space and the stratosphere.\n\\\"Boundaries that are not yet determined shall be fixed by treaty and law.\\\"\n196.\tWhen studies of the renewable resources of the sea or in relation to its shelf led to their first results, it was observed that the life cycle of certain exploitable species went on at depths beyond the 200 meter isobath, thus giving greater strength to the claim for the total area of the shelf, and to distances far beyond 3, 6 or 12 miles of the territorial sea, which had commonly been accepted.\n197.\tPending an international agreement which would solve the problem of the breadth of the. territorial sea, but in complete agreement with the economic and ecological reasons which called for a greater breadth of the sea for their renewable resources, the Government of Nicaragua proclaimed, in 1965, a national fisheries zone of 200 nautical miles in breadth, which was immediately placed under a rationally increasing regime of exploitation, and, using foreign capital and technology, national, foreign and mixed companies were set up, all of which were offered sound guarantees under our national legislation.\n198.\tIn July 1972, together with the countries of the Caribbean, Nicaragua participated in the formulation of the Santo Domingo Declaration [A/8721, annex I, sect. 2J. In that Declaration, the countries of this region, which is unique in that it unites instead of dividing its riparian countries, strengthened the basic principles of the first conceptions of renewing the law of the sea.\n199.\tBeyond doubt, the countries of the Caribbean declared their will to have a territorial sea of 12 miles, but they confirmed the sovereign rights of the coastal States over the continental shelf which extended their territory under the sea and over an area of the sea which would not exceed 200 miles in breadth and would encompass the territorial sea and the patrimonial sea of each riparian State as a legitimate aspiration capable of becoming a criterion of universal application.\n200.\tIt is a happy coincidence of thought that exists between the countries of the Caribbean Sea because even though there were problems of delimitation between two or more States a solution would be found in accordance with the peaceful procedures provided in the Charter of the United Nations.\n201.\tWhat is essential is that in the Santo Domingo Declaration a significant group of Latin American States set down for the law of the sea rules which are as objective as is possible in the present stage of development of social sciences, economic relations and the natural environment, the art of politics and the administration of development.\n202.\tIt has been the will of all the peoples of the world to place those problems for study and care with the United Nations so that, in the third international conference of plenipotentiaries on the law of the sea, the problems could be settled in conventions, which would do justice to all peoples, without discrimination or favoritism. This planet has been created and exists for all in accordance with our Christian tradition, and it is the minds of men, and their right conscience, which is responsible for ensuring that this common heritage is shared among all.\n203.\tAs this task is difficult, my Government is ready to participate in all the preliminary phases and in the third conference itself, and if necessary, it would be prepared to support a movement designed to make the sea-bed Committee and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea an organization of the United Nations similar to UNCTAD, specializing in the various aspects of ocean space and the relations which could be established through that area to increase solidarity and co-operation among peoples, dealing with such complicated and important items with the prudence and care which the interests of all the nations of the world counsel in these circumstances.\n204.\tIt is here that we must see the necessary function of the United Nations to exercise moral leadership among the organizations mankind has set up to bring to reality and give concrete form to its aspirations in rational institutions which will ensure the well-being and progress of all the peoples of the world.\n205.\tBut we cannot forget that this moral function will be obstructed and perhaps even wiped out if we do not grant our Organization the regulatory capacity and perhaps the power to settle moral problems in positive law of objective force which it should have.\n206.\tThe agenda to be dealt with at this session of the Assembly tells us that there are very serious problems that must cease to be subjects of speculation and reasoning, and pass on to the stage of specific regulation which will ensure peace and development for all nations. International wealth, like individual wealth, must have social responsibilities which should be defined unequivocally. The objective principles which strengthen the physical heritage of nations should be met with parallel principles which are equally objective to strengthen the equality of opportunity of all States and peoples and their equal access to this other aspect of our heritage, which is our cultural heritage. The benefits of science, technology and culture, the work of countless generations of mankind, are part of the common heritage to which all people should have access for their evolution and progress.\n207.\tNicaragua is firmly determined to contribute to those aspects with concrete deeds of law and the action of its Government, so that international wealth and the technology of mankind, can join with the capacities of the Nicaraguan people rationally to exploit its physical patrimony. For some time Nicaragua has been enacting beneficial legislation so that foreign capital and technology can suitably participate in national development.\n208.\tOur Government has paid particular attention to the multiple relationships with our brother countries of Central America. For us they are part and parcel of our own nature and we know that we share their brotherly feelings. For some years we have been integrated into the Central American Common Market, which represents our best security for development. Since we have almost come of age, we find it necessary to make adaptations which the five brother countries are looking for with great determination, certain as we are that our words of union should be reflected in action.\n209.\tNicaragua wishes to express its confidence in its brothers of Central America, once more offering them its broadest co-operation in the search for common action for the benefit and progress of all.\n210.\tWe have set up incipient but valuable ties with neighboring countries outside the Central American area and we are open to alternative proposals from multinational or bilateral companies for the rational exploitation of our continental shelf and our seas with all countries, principally with those of the Caribbean Sea which are our sisters in destiny, needs and aspirations.\n211.\tWe believe that we thereby contribute effectively to the aspirations of mankind as reflected in the Charter, which has guided us since 1945 and which imposed on us certain moral obligations which gradually have been assuming the form of regulations and laws among nations. Its functioning and adaptation to the changing conditions of the world require not only the exertion of intellectual effort, but also the expenditure of material resources. We agree with the aspiration of the Government of the United States of America in setting a lower limit than the present one for the maximum participation of a single country in the financing of our Organization. We believe that this aspiration coincides effectively with the need that the United Nations in its functioning should not depend on the will of a single State. None the less, it is our obligation to point out that the developing countries, with their declining participation in international trade, their increasing burden of external debt and their urgent need to finance internal development programs, cannot forthwith assume the weight of an excessive increase in their regular contributions. We trust that some formula will be worked out so that other States that are more developed will accept the new burdens, while the general progress of the world will enable the developing countries to participate more fully in the set financial contributions which are required for the functioning of our Organization.\n212.\tIn all that I have said here in terms of the general lines of the policy followed by the National Government Junta of Nicaragua, there is only the most fervent faith that my country and its Government have in this Organization as a moral beacon and the seedbed of positive law in which peoples that love peace should cement their hopes for the future.\n213.\tThe United Nations cannot fail to meet this imperative task with which it has been entrusted by history. Let vs not be discouraged by the magnitude of the task because, as there is a breath of reason, it will be the flame which will ignite the will to succeed.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to extend to you, on behalf of the Italian Government, my congratulations and good wishes. I am addressing not only a distinguished statesman but the representative of a noble people to which the Italians feel very close, sharing with it many traditions and the same deep love of peace. In recalling the important work performed by this Assembly last year under the guidance of your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, I am certain that the results of the current session will prove just as fruitful.\n59.\tI wish to assure the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, of my sincere appreciation of the dedication with which he has undertaken his difficult task in the service of the Organization. He knows that he can rely on the support of my Government in carrying out his high mission as the faithful interpreter of the spirit of the Charter.\n60.\tThe speakers who have preceded me have referred to the expectations and anxieties of their peoples, but it seems to me that the most significant note which has resounded up to now in this world Assembly has been a note of hope.\n61.\tIn spite of persistent conflicts and selfish nationalisms, in spite of the unleashing of violence no longer restrained by national or international law, we all feel that a relaxation of tension in international relations is taking place.\n62.\tLet me first have a look at Asia, where the worst conflict of the last 25 years is still raging, but where we now note some encouraging symptoms. Two great peoples, the Chinese and the Japanese, are trying to bridge the gulf which has separated them in recent times. This is an event which can greatly contribute to a better and more stable international community. North and South Korea are moving towards the normalization of their relations and we hope that nothing will interfere with these new and promising developments. In the Asian subcontinent, the way is now open to negotiations; if that path is followed with farsightedness, it will be possible to re-establish harmony among the States of that huge area to the benefit of the whole international community. In this spirit we hope that we may soon welcome Bangladesh in our midst.\n63.\tThe recent developments in Europe are bound to give a decisive contribution to the stability of the old continent and, therefore, of the whole international order. The Community, which the Western European countries are building, is undergoing a process of strengthening and enlargement. It is and will remain a commonwealth of free peoples, founded on the heritage of a common civilization and on a common conception of democracy, social progress and the dignity of man. This association of States is and will remain open to co-operation with the rest of the world.\n64.\tThe European Community intends to live up to its responsibilities in so far as its relations with other States, and in particular with the developing countries, are concerned. One of the most important issues to be discussed at the forthcoming summit meeting in-Paris, next October, will be a plan for co-operation with the latter countries. The European Community intends to honor the commitments which it has undertaken in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for the development of trade within the framework of a system of generalized preferences.\n65.\tOne of the main goals of the Community is the gradual closing, through a realistic and constructive dialog, of the gap which has divided Europe during the last 25 years. The Community is attempting to set up new relations, based on the recognition of reality, on mutual trust and on the free exchange of people, information and ideas. If, as we hope, the outcome of the negotiations now going on in order to normalize the relations between the two States of the German nation is a positive one, an important obstacle on the way to European co-operation will be removed.\n66. Further momentum for this process will be provided by the conference for security and co-operation in Europe. In this spirit, we are working towards the adequate preparation of that conference.\n67.\tBut Europe cannot feel secure unless there is peace also in the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the ghost of war is still looming over the Near East, and the resolutions of the United Nations have so far remained in the limbo of good intentions.\n68.\tFurthermore, despite the appeals made to the parties directly involved in the conflict we are now witnessing a resumption of violence which threatens to get out of hand. That tension is the result of a lack of progress in working out a just solution to the conflict in that region. It is the duty of the United Nations to encourage the parties- as well as the Powers which wield some influence in that area to act in such a way that a just solution may be found. We maintain that the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts is the most valid way to a lasting settlement in the area.\n69.\tThe easing of tension necessarily involves the problem of disarmament. I should therefore like to stress the interest which my Government has always attached to this important issue, so essential for the strengthening of peace.\n70.\tWe are deeply committed to the objectives of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and we express the hope that when it resumes its work the important negotiations undertaken by it will achieve positive results. We equally trust that the resumption of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks will bring about fruitful results.\n71.\tFinally, we welcomed with interest the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference. Such an initiative will be all the more effective if it is supported by the general membership of the United Nations, including all the nuclear Powers, and if it is accurately prepared by an adequately representative organ.\n72.\tMeanwhile, proposals have been submitted which are designed to limit arguments on a regional scale. We think that they should be viewed in the framework of the general balance of forces. Such regional initiatives, therefore, will benefit from the institution of machinery like the world disarmament conference.\n73.\tWe can therefore hope that we are on the threshold of further progress towards detente. However, we must do what is necessary to prevent the setting up of a new pattern of international relations from taking place at the expense of freedom for peoples and independence for nations. The emergence of new Powers on the world scene should be accompanied by the increasingly responsible participation of all countries in the life of the international community.\n74.\tOur Assembly, which last year finally welcomed in its midst the representatives of the great Chinese people, should give its utmost attention to this problem. Another important step is likely to be taken towards the universality of the United Nations. We do hope that the two German States will successfully conclude their negotiations and thus be able to join our Organization.\n75.\tFor other so-called divided States the way to membership in the United Nations is still difficult. However, the negotiations in progress between the two Koreas raise some hope. Some better prospects arise also from the confirmed determination of the United States Government to withdraw all its troops from Viet-Nam. I should like to express in this Assembly the good wishes of the Italian people and Government to the Vietnamese people, so sorely tried by the horrors of war. I do hope that in the near future all the peoples of Indochina will be able to devote themselves, in security and independence, to the rehabilitation of their countries.\n76.\tThe full attainment of the objectives of decolonization, solemnly and repeatedly voiced in this Assembly, will open the doors of the United Nations to some new peoples that are still yearning for independence. The Italian Government confirms its full adherence to this goal. We are convinced that we must facilitate, in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with its provisions, the historical process which will wipe out the last vestiges of colonialism, especially in the African continent.\n77.\tThe foresight of the founding fathers made the United Nations flexible enough to enable it after more than a quarter of a century to deal with previously unforeseen problems, such as those of the developing countries, of the technological and scientific gap and of the protection of the environment. However, no one can deny the fact that, on the issue of the maintenance of peace and security, international reality has followed a course different from that advocated in 1945, thus partly frustrating the original expectations.\n78.\tWhile the great Powers were slowly moving from a \\\"balance of terror\\\" to a dialog which was the product of the so-called \\\"balance of caution\\\", the members of the international community were increasing in number and new centers of influence were rising. These new centers, thanks to the great contribution they can make to economic and cultural development, should be enabled to participate more fully in the system of collective security established by the Charter.\n79.\tThe Italian Government has repeatedly stated to this Assembly its point of view on the matter of international security.\n80.\tPeace-keeping requires, besides measures to avoid possible conflicts or to settle those that already exist, a global commitment for the gradual removal of the deeper and sometimes old causes of conflict. We must include among these causes all kinds of interference in international affairs, any limitation of sovereignty or any attempt to limit the freedom of each people to choose the regime under which it wants to live. If in some continents these ills are the remnants of the colonial policy of the past, in others they are the consequence of power politics.\n81.\tOur commitment must be further directed against serious violations of human rights. Genocide, racial discrimination and political persecution, so much more unacceptable when carried out with the appearance of legality, are a permanent threat to peace.\n82.\tThe search for peace must aim at reducing the economic imbalance which separates countries and obstructs the path towards an effective equality among men of different races.\n83.\tWe must therefore strive to promote broader observance of international law. This can be obtained by strengthening the means for the peaceful settlement of international disputes, by enhancing the role of the International Court of Justice, by developing and codifying international law and by creating effective peacekeeping instruments of the United Nations. There is also the need to solve the serious problems arising from both terrorism and retaliation, which produce so many innocent victims in various parts of the world. In this respect, we listened with interest to the proposal of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers [2038th meeting], and we shall carefully study the draft convention submitted to this Assembly [A/C.6/L.850]. We are ready to co-operate in drawing up a text of a resolution which could meet with wide approval.\n84.\tWe think it is our duty to ask ourselves whether the structure of the United Nations can fulfill the Organization's present tasks. The Italian Government believes that, while fully respecting the purposes and principles of the Charter as they stand, some structures of our Organization must be adjusted to the new realities and to the new requirements which have arisen during the past 25 years. As was pointed out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Mr. Gibson Barboza, when he opened the general debate:\n\\\"It is beyond question, in our view, that the participation of the medium-sized and small Powers would be highly constructive and creative; it would be tantamount to an infusion of new blood, which might serve to heal the sclerosis of structures that have aged apparently without being aware of it.\\\" [2038th meeting, para. 19.]\n85.\tIn this connexion the Secretary-General noted in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that collective security should not be based only on the agreement of a few Powers [A/8701/Add.l, p. 2]. We must go beyond the image of the United Nations as the \\\"warden of peace\\\" and strive for a United Nations capable of eradicating the basic causes of international tension, of harmonizing opposing interests and of creating better standards of living for all peoples.\n86.\tFurthermore, a new approach to the problems concerning peace and security requires the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. Its capacity for furthering the aims of the United Nations in the field of economic development, of social progress and of the protection of human rights must become more incisive.\n87.\tWe also consider that the responsibilities within our Organization should be better distributed, taking into account the contribution which each Member country can make, commensurate with its capacity, towards the achievement of the objectives I have indicated.\n88.\tThe world undoubtedly owes much to the sense of responsibility shown by the great military Powers. But the concept of peace and security which I mentioned earlier implies that the time has come for other countries to share world responsibilities. I am referring to countries which, although they are not-and choose not to be-nuclear Powers, can still make substantial contributions to the maintenance of peace, since they are in a position to promote and advance the economic, social, scientific, technical and cultural progress of mankind. It was therefore with satisfaction that we heard Mr. Rogers say in his statement to the Assembly that:\n\\\"... we believe that for the Security Council to maintain its influence and authority, ways must be found to ensure the representation of States, other than the present permanent members . . . whose resources and influence are of major importance in world affairs.\\\" [2038th meeting, para. 64.]\nMy country hopes that such a constructive approach will be adopted by the other permanent members of the Security Council.\n89.\tThe role of the United Nations and of its specialized agencies is ever growing and unique. In order to be increasingly able to deal with the deep-rooted causes of international tension, the United Nations must enlarge its decision-making process by associating the emerging countries with it. At 'lie same time the United Nations must obtain the cooperation of the great democratic forces of the world. Democratic institutions in national societies remain alive and operate through the full support of their major political forces. Similarly the vitality and the efficiency of a world Organization depend, to a large extent, upon the adherence and contribution of the most influential nations.\n90.\tLet me conclude by restating the sincere confidence of the Italian Government in the United Nations as well as in the purposes and principles of its Charter. I also wish to assure you once again that the Italian Government, interpreting the deep felt dedication to peace of its people, will continue to give its unrestricted cooperation to the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the time when I have the honor of addressing representatives of the nations of the world meeting together here, I take particular pleasure in conveying to Mr. Stanisjfaw Trepczynski my sincere and warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of our Assembly. That unanimous election on the part of the States Members of our Organization is no mere accident, but is due to his many statesman-like qualities and virtues as a servant of the international community.\n21.\tPermit me also to pay a tribute to Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who discharged with talent and wisdom the responsibilities which you now bear.\n22.\tI should also like to express my admiration to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, whose great qualities, sense of responsibility, determination to succeed and perseverance are obvious to everyone. I should like to extend to him my best wishes for his good health, happiness and complete success in his heavy tasks.\n23.\tMr. President, may I assure you of the unfailing co-operation of my country which, as a Member of the United Nations, shares the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Indeed, apart from\nobserving the principles of the San Francisco Charter, my country makes it a fundamental rule of its foreign policy to foster understanding among all peoples of the world on the basis of absolute respect for human rights, equality of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.\n24.\tLoyal to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Government of the Republic of Chad has unceasingly expressed its indignation at the subjugation of the people of Africa who are still suffering under Portuguese barbarism and under the apartheid regimes of Vorster and the rebel Ian Smith. Here and in the Organization of African Unity [OAU] my country strongly condemns the servitude of our African brothers, whom a handful of outsiders want to exploit for the sake of reactionary ideas which have been condemned by the world. The attitude of the Portuguese, of Vorster and of Ian Smith is an affront to mankind and has persisted far too long. The United Nations, guarantor of the fundamental principles of the Charter, should delay no longer in putting an end to this defiance by all appropriate means, because the very persistence of this situation is nothing but a flouting of the resolutions and recommendations of our Organization.\n25.\tThe OAU, of which my country is a founding member, is determined to bring about the total liberation of the continent from foreign domination. For our country this is the priority of priorities, namely, that the whole of Africa should recover the rights which have been taken from it. This is an urgent duty and we consider that it is a duty which must be discharged immediately. The assistance that it grants to recognized liberation movements reflects this determination to see the whole continent recover its dignity. The ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Rabat from 12 to 15 June 1972, was obvious proof of this, as were the previous Assemblies. However, the OAU does not at all want to act alone. It believes that it is its duty to provide a substantial contribution to the efforts of the universal Organization. Everyone is aware of the fact that the objectives and purposes of these two organizations coincide totally.\n26.\tWe must note that in other parts of the world there are persisting problems as burning as the ones that I have mentioned.\n27.\tIn the Middle East there is a period of respite at the moment because the situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" in which the peoples of that area live cannot satisfy our community. Is it possible to see here any kind of promising prospects for peace and harmony, or should we consider this rather as a mirage? Thus, in the face of this alternative, my Government thinks that it is the duty of the United Nations alone to act and to act quickly so as to prevent the loss of more and more human lives tomorrow, as yesterday, as a result of gunfire. The United Nations has already set out a basis for action with a view to a peaceful and equitable solution of the problem in that area. I have in mind particularly Security Council resolution 242(1967), which includes relevant principles whose application offers guarantees of survival to each of the parties to the conflict. However that may be, my Government, reaffirming its attachment to the United Nations Charter and to that of the OAU, is categorically opposed to the acquisition and occupation of foreign territory by force.\n28.\tThe right of the people of Palestine to recover their national heritage has been recognized. In this regard, I should like to remind members, among other things, of the following: resolution 2535 B (XXIV), in which the General Assembly reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people; resolution 2672 C (XXV), in which the General Assembly recognized that the people of Palestine should be able to enjoy equal rights and the exercise of their right to self-determination under the Charter; resolution 2649 (XXV), in which the General Assembly recognized the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination.\n29.\tThose who with the complicity of certain great Powers are striving to maintain the status quo of the Palestinians and who trample underfoot the decisions of the international Organization are alone responsible for this crime against mankind.\n30.\tIf we have thought it our duty to associate ourselves with the desire of the Secretary-General to include in the agenda of our session the burning problem of terrorism, it is because we wanted it to be discussed and we wanted to see the facts clearly. We condemn international terrorism in all its manifestation, but I want to be properly understood. We absolutely exclude any idea of using this as a way of calling into question the legitimate activities of African liberation movements recognized by the OAU. Nor can there be any question for us of trying to wrest from the Palestinians their absolute right, which has been recognized, to recover their lost territory.\n31.\tWe must clearly define at this session the term \\\"international terrorism\\\", and we must also look for its causes and try to find objective solutions that would satisfy everyone. But let us not delude ourselves. This is indeed a complex problem.\n32.\tThe President of the French Republic, in his press conference of 21 September last, said:\n\\\"Terrorism, to the extent that it affects everyone blindly, whether innocent or not, is something we condemn. But let us cherish no illusions; we shall not eliminate Palestinian terrorism if we do not find some solution to the Palestinian problem. You cannot eliminate a phenomenon of this kind if you do not resolve the deep-seated cause of the phenomenon.\\\"\n33.\tIf my delegation had noted any maneuver whatsoever designed to call into the question the activities of the valiant African freedom fighters recognized by the OAU, for example, then, of course, we would be obliged to reconsider our position. That is how I would like to explain the vote of the Chad delegation in favor of including on the agenda the item on international terrorism [item 92].\n34.\tIn South-East Asia bloody and murderous fighting is still going on and is destroying innocent and defenseless people. This annihilation has become a routine matter for the imperialist sadists, who for various reasons want to keep it going. In fact, these wars are no longer the exclusive affair of the parties directly concerned and confronting each other, but derive their causes from ideological intervention and a desire for hegemony. None of these reasons can meet with our approval, nor should they divert the attention of our Organization, for which no war can. be a matter of routine but must always be a matter of urgent concern.\n35.\tThe United Nations must demand from those who are the founding Members, but who do not hesitate to bring the Organization into ridicule, the complete and immediate cessation of the crimes which they have been committing for several years.\n36.\tIn the view of the Chad delegation, there are a few reasons that explain the persistence of world problems. Everywhere we see resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations that cannot be put into effect because it is not the will of any given Power in a given instance. Each Power is looking for its own victory outside the world Organization. Out of scorn for other States, all these Powers systematically trample underfoot our resolutions and recommendations, which are after all common solutions to common problems. Since it is so difficult for them to come to an agreement, their attempts to seek victory for themselves are vain' and futile. That is why, in Africa, Portugal, Vorster and Ian Smith have not yet given way to our international Organization. That is why in the Middle East Security Council resolution 242(1967) has so far remained unimplemented. That is why in South-East Asia, men, women and children continue to be incinerated every day.\n37.\tWe would also like to make some comments in the context of international economic development. There is one particular point I should like to make and this relates to the third session of UNCTAD, held in Santiago, Chile. At the opening of this session there was a feeling of hope. The poorer countries did indeed expect of it the adoption of a new concept of commercial solidarity in the international community. Our hope was based on the statements of the affluent countries, which we thought indicated their will finally to do something about the inequalities existing between them and the developing countries by undertaking to make a global effort to promote international trade and aid for development. But, unfortunately, nothing of the kind happened and there was only disappointment in store for us with regard to the conclusion of the Santiago Conference. Yet the Group of 77 developing countries had made the necessary arrangements to facilitate this global effort. But, in spite of all this, the regional and national selfishness of the developed countries won the day over international solidarity. Let us hope that at the fourth session of UNCTAD the undemanding of the affluent countries will spare us the evils now being suffered by the countries of the third world.\n38.\tAlthough many world problems remain outstanding, the Government of the Republic of Chad notes with satisfaction the climate of detente which is to be glimpsed on some horizons renunciation of the use of force; limitation of the arms race; peaceful coexistence demonstrated on the one hand by the visits of the President of the United States to Peking and Moscow, and on the other, by the entry into force of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland, and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. Those are facts which constitute the new kind of relationships which we are looking for between the peoples of the world and which have particularly marked the year 1972. That is not all. The year 1972 has witnessed a new trend in the relations between the two Korean Governments.\n39.\t* The postponement at our previous session of a discussion of the question of Korea without any doubt contributed to the creation of a climate of eased tension between these two parties, and, believe me, if it had been otherwise, we would certainly not be witnessing the results we witness today. That is why my delegation considers that this year again the United Nations should welcome and encourage the efforts of the Korean Governments by refraining from doing anything which might jeopardize their negotiations.\n40.\tI would be failing in my duty if, in conclusion, in the absence of U Thant, our former Secretary-General, I were not to pay the tribute to him which he is entitled to expect of us for all that he did during the difficult years when he faced, so honorably, various burning problems of all dimensions. On behalf of the Head of State, the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Francois Tombalbaye, Secretary-General of the Progressive Party of Chad, and on my own behalf, I would like to convey to him our very best wishes for very good health and happiness.\n41.\tMy Head of State has made it clear, with regard to the question of China, that that vast country is a partner which cannot be ignored in the world system of peaceful coexistence because it is a Power whose responsibility it should be to ensure a balance of power in the world. Through the delegation of China in this hall, we greet the Chinese people and Government.\n42.\tThe resolutions adopted by our National Congress in Sarh, in April of last year, recommended that we adopt a policy of an opening up of international relations. This is a concrete manifestation of the constant efforts of President Francois Tombalbaye, Secretary-General of the Progressive Party of Chad and Head of State.\n43.\tWith all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries the Government of my country would like to maintain cordial relations based on mutual respect for the principles of the charter of the OAU and of the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I extend to you the congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session. Poland and the Arab nation, of which my country is an integral part, have had for many years the closest and most friendly relations.\n147.\tMay I also express our appreciation for the brilliant manner in which Mr. Adam Malik, the illustrious Foreign Minister of Indonesia, presided over the previous session.\n148.\tWe also wish our new Secretary-General success in the discharge of his important responsibilities.\n149.\tIn this first year of our independence, our main task has been to find our proper place and role in the international community, a place and role determined by our history, geographical position, economic resources and, above all, by the desires and expectations of our people.\n150.\tOur Union is open to all Arab countries in the Gulf area and elsewhere. We are firm believers in the ideal of Arab unity and we hope that our example will reverse the trend towards fragmentation and division in the Arab world and herald a new era in which the Arab nation will be able to play a beneficent and significant role in world affairs which its history, its culture and its resources entitle it to play. We have fully identified ourselves with the fundamental positions of principle taken by the Arab countries within the framework of the League of Arab States, of which we are now a member.\n151.\tThe question euphemistically called \\\"The situation in the Middle East\\\" [item 21], and which I would prefer to call by its proper name \\\"the question of Palestine\\\", remains the central national issue for the Arab people. Essentially it is the plight of a people dispossessed and driven out of its homeland by a colonialist armed invasion. So long as the people of Palestine are denied their fundamental rights in their ancestral homeland, there can be no settlement, nor peace in the Middle East.\n152.\tA good deal has been said recently about the problem of terrorism. Israel, of course, has been attempting to derive some propaganda advantage and to exploit a very serious human problem, so characteristic of our times, to achieve narrow and selfish political gains and to set the stage for further territorial acquisitions and the fulfillment of its well-known expansionist aims. I am certain that the General Assembly will not be diverted by these crude and obvious maneuvers from its duty to discuss the issue with the sense of sober responsibility it deserves.\n153.\tThe people of Palestine have waited in vain for a quarter of a century for some redress of the grave injustice inflicted upon them. The international community, whose collective will this Organization represents, has seemed to be oblivious to their plight and through its inaction, over the years, has implicitly acquiesced in Israel's aggression. Israel was founded and has maintained itself by the systematic and ruthless practice of terror: terror which drove the majority of Palestinians out of their homeland, terror which deprived them of freedom and dignity, terror which made the remnants who stayed behind second-class citizens in their own country, terror which pursued them in their unhappy exile, in their wretched refugee camps, and slaughtered them by the hundreds. We do not and cannot condone the killing of innocent people, but how can we equate the desperate acts of a few individuals driven by \\\"misery, frustration, grievance and despair\\\", to quote the Secretary-General's words [see A/8791/Add.l], with the brutal, deliberate and cold-blooded acts of indiscriminate killing perpetrated by the armed forces of a State? Let us not make the mistake of thinking that these are acts of revenge; they are concerned primarily with the achievement of long-standing strategic and political aims.\n154.\tOur geographical position in the Gulf has given us a vital interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in that important economic and strategic area of the world. We have endeavored to establish the closest relations with our neighbors. It is our firm belief that the peace and stability of the Gulf region can be maintained only with the co-operation of its States and with their respect for one another's independence and territorial integrity. Whatever disputes or differences exist at present or may arise in the future can and must be resolved by peaceful means and in a manner that will recognize and preserve the legitimate rights of all parties concerned without prejudice to their basic national interests. We are ready now, as we have always been, to co-operate with our neighbors to create a climate of understanding and harmony, which is essential for the peace and progress of the region and the welfare of all its people. The peace and security of the Gulf will be greatly enhanced by making the Indian Ocean region a zone of peace. We support the resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on this question [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and will welcome any further action at this session to ensure its implementation.\n155.\tWe are meeting at a time of rapid and sometimes dramatic change in the world situation. There have been unmistakable and welcome signs of a detente among the great Powers, a development of great importance in view of the fact that under the Charter these States have a primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is our hope that this is the beginning of an irreversible trend towards a greater degree of genuine international co-operation and not merely a temporary interruption in the cold war. Thus, on the central problem of war and peace we are entitled to express some cautious optimism. There are certainly some clear and concrete grounds for such optimism: the agreement on the partial limitation of strategic weapons, the ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland, the four-Power agreement on Berlin and the understanding reached between the two Governments of Korea, which may lead to the unification of that country. These encouraging developments have paradoxically given rise to some anxiety among the smaller countries. There is a feeling that the reduction of tensions among the great Powers may lead to the imposition of solutions to international problems that will ignore the desires and interests of other countries, especially those directly concerned. We hope that these fears are un-founded.\n156.\tAs we look at the agenda of this session, we still see some of the problems which have been dealt with by this Organization since its inception, such as colonialism and apartheid. A genocidal war is being waged against the African people who are struggling to free themselves from colonial domination. The racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to flout the will of the international community, encouraged by their undiminished trade with their Western trading partners and the continued flow of investments from abroad.\n157.\tIn their meeting held in Cairo earlier this month, the Arab Foreign Ministers issued a declaration on South East Asia affirming the solidarity of the Arab States with the peoples of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos in their struggle for national liberation and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from their lands. The declaration also condemned the aggression to which those countries have been subjected.\n158.\tIt will be unnecessary for me to dwell upon the serious economic problems facing the developing countries and the failure of all attempts to narrow the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. Perhaps nowhere is the tendency of certain advanced countries to take decisions affecting others more pronounced than it is in economic matters. Problems relating to the international monetary system and trade are discussed and dealt with by the major Powers without much concern for the vital interests of the developing countries. The third session of UNCTAD revealed the problem facing' the developing countries in all its painful dimensions. It is obvious that the developing countries have to strengthen and expand the co-operation among themselves and that they should shift their emphasis from exhortations addressed to the developed countries, which have largely fallen on deaf ears, to the greater possibilities of cooperation among themselves.\n159.\tWe have established a development fund with an initial capital of over $100 million to assist the countries of the region in their plans of development. Over and above this, we are also ready to contribute, within the limits of our means, to the various international and regional development activities undertaken by the United Nations and its specialized agencies.\n160.\tThere is undoubtedly a close link between the problems of development and disarmament. If only a fraction of the billions being squandered on the arms race were diverted to the urgent needs of the developing countries, then the whole depressing picture which con-fronts us today would be transformed beyond recognition. For this reason we support the convening of an inter-national conference on disarmament, with a view to the reduction and ultimate elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.\n161.\tAn event of great importance this year has been the adoption of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and the machinery being established to put into effect the principles and aims of that Declaration.\n162.\tI finally come to the question of the United Nations and the strengthening of its role and efficacy. This has always been a major concern of the smaller countries, such as my own. It stems from the belief that only through the United Nations can we translate into living reality the principles and ideals which bind us together. But it would be idle to pretend that the United Nations is not now, and has not been for some years, passing through a period of decline. The Organization has been purposely and rigorously prevented from playing any role in some crucial international problems. The United Nations has been rendered virtually powerless, through the obstruction of certain great Powers, to secure the implementation of its resolutions on Palestine, the Middle East, apartheid and colonialism. But we must first of all recognize that there are certain inherent weaknesses in the Charter itself. The Charter is, after all, a document which was drawn up before the advent of the nuclear age when a vast number of countries were still under foreign rule.\n163.\tThe Charter is also based on two basic assumptions which have been largely overtaken by the spectacular developments of the last quarter of a century. The two assumptions are that the hegemony of the great Powers will always be accepted as a permanent fact of international life and that the great Powers will, more often than not, act together to deal with major international problems. How-ever, in spite of its structural defects and the invalidity of its basic assumptions, the Charter is flexible enough to enable us to transform it into an effective instrument of the international order which we envisage for the future.\n164.\tAs a token of our faith in the United Nations and confidence in its future, my Government has decided to respond favourably to the appeal of the Secretary-General and make a contribution which we hope will help to alleviate the financial difficulties facing the Organization.\n"

We are confident that your wide experience and the perception and statesmanship which you have shown in the service of your country will prove valuable to you in guiding the challenging tasks of this Assembly towards a successful outcome, thereby giving added impulse to the cause of international peace, cooperation and progress.\n2.\tI am particularly pleased to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, for the admirable manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The wisdom, dignity and good sense which he brought to this office will long be remembered.\n3.\tI wish also to express to the Secretary-General the congratulations of the Burmese delegation on his able and penetrating appreciation contained in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/ Add.l] -of the realities of the present international situation and the future role of the United Nations.\n4.\tThe interval between the last session and the present session of the General Assembly has been a period marked by events of historical and political significance events that have fundamentally changed the configuration of international relations and have brought us to the awareness that the post-war structure of international politics has come to an end. Altogether, a new era in the international order is now taking shape before us. After having passed through over two decades of a structure of bipolar world politics imprinted with a highly charged ideological conflict, a cold war, that constantly verged on the brink of a potential nuclear outbreak, the protagonists on the world's political stage are now coming to acknowledge the realities which have emerged in the international system and seemingly are moving towards a more pragmatic relationship based upon the demands of very real mutual national interests that far transcend their differences.\n5.\tIn our view, this is clearly a welcome process. It is an evolution that fosters international detente. The more steps the major Powers take to blunt the sharp edges of ideological hostility and move towards realistic accommodation, the less justification will there be for the existence of Power blocs and the delimitation of the international community. The more the major Powers regulate their relations on the pragmatic basis of coexistence and recognize their global responsibility by reason of their great destructive capacity, the less likely are the chances of provoking a nuclear war. The world follows the current changes with great interest and with the high expectation that the major Powers will not fail to show a way out of the impasse of the last 26 years. For this to be achieved, it would obviously be necessary for any detente, any accommodation between the major Powers, to extend beyond them in order to embrace all regions, especially those where conflicts and tensions continue to exist and where the presence of such Powers is most felt.\n6.\tThe new events that have occurred are familiar to all of us and I do not propose to burden the Assembly with a detailed commentary. In summary, they include the dramatic shifts in the position of rival major Powers. After more than 20 years of hostility the first contact, established this year in Peking, between the President of the United States and the leaders of China marked a historic world turning-point. The Moscow summit last May between the President of the United States and Soviet leaders was of major political significance. These developments have led to greater flexibility in international relations.\n7.\tThe benefits of the changing international circumstances have also been felt in some long-standing areas of tension and conflict. On the Indian subcontinent and in the Korean peninsula there is a tendency on the part of the opponents to enter into a process which could, phase by phase, restore durable peace and security in their respective areas.\n8.\tThe recent Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan has contributed considerably to the lessening of tension and the promotion of peace and stability not only in the subcontinent but also in Asia as a whole. The Governments of the two countries have agreed to put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have marred their relations and to work for the promotion of a friendly and harmonious relationship and the establishment of \ndurable peace in the subcontinent so that both of them may henceforth devote their resources and energies to the pressing task of advancing the welfare of their peoples. The Burmese delegation very much welcomes this positive development.\n9.\tIn Korea, a significant breakthrough has been achieved after years of misunderstanding and mistrust, hostility and conflict. North and South Korea have agreed that the reunification of their country shall be achieved through independent Korean efforts without being subjected to external imposition or interference, that it shall be achieved through peaceful means and not through the use of force against each other, and that a great national unity shall be sought above all, transcending differences in ideas, ideologies and systems. Appropriate measures are now being taken by the two sides to achieve this national objective.\n10.\tI cannot help also mentioning that elsewhere in Asia significant movements are under way to secure the recognition of and respect for the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, and the South-East Asian region as a whole as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of intervention by outside Powers. We believe that the prospects for the success of these movements would greatly improve if the major Powers would cease using the region as an arena of influence and abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence-notably the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.\n11.\tAll in all, these developments of historical and political import hold forth greater promise for the future than the last 26 years of crisis and hostility. They represent great decisions in terms of overcoming one's self and in terms of the exercise of a high degree of moral responsibility and statesmanship by the leaders of our contemporary world.\n12.\tAll countries have a clear interest in the evolution of a world which allows for peaceful and stable coexistence. The past year has seen the basic principles of peaceful coexistence gaining more and more ground among the major Powers. In this connexion it is of particular significance that the United States of America and the People's Republic of China, in their joint communique issued at Shanghai on 27 February 1972, and the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in their statement of basic principles on their mutual relations issued at Moscow on 29 May 1972,  pledged themselves to abide by the basic principles of peaceful coexistence, thus expanding the area of acceptance of those principles in international relations. As a country that has upheld those principles and applied them in pursuing a policy of active friendship with ail nations, Burma naturally welcomes their application to the fullest extent in international relations. For humanity to prosper without fear or suspicion, we must engender in the world community a sense of faith and confidence in inter-State relations. The prerequisite for this is the willingness and determination of all nations to live together as good neighbors, irrespective of each other's political, economic and social systems, and to observe the principles of peaceful coexistence namely, mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit.\n13.\tIn spite of the tangible results of the international detente now unfolding before us, we do not overlook the fact that in IndoChina and in the Middle East the situation is one of sharp contrast, and it is a sad commentary on our times that it should remain unsolved for years on end.\n14.\tThe continued rivalry and intervention of outside Powers in the States of IndoChina still threaten the peace and security of the South-East Asian region. This intervention has resulted only in untold suffering, the loss of countless lives and massive material destruction. As a nation belonging to the same region and having experienced the senseless rigors of war on its soil during the Second World War, Burma is deeply concerned with the tragic plight of all the peoples of IndoChina. In particular, the situation in Viet-Nam continues to weigh heavily on the conscience of nations. The tragedy is that for 30 years the people of VietNam have been subjected continuously to violence and untold misery. We cannot but be struck by the scale and intensity of the hostilities that continue and the devastating proportions of the modern weaponry employed. The delegation of Burma believes that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the States of IndoChina, a firm commitment by outside Powers not to intervene in any manner whatever, under any circumstances, in the internal affairs of those States, and direct negotiations between the indigenous parties concerned to achieve national reconciliation all these conditions are necessary to enable the peoples of those States to work out peaceful solutions to their problems by themselves.\n15.\tAs far as the Middle East situation is concerned, Burma views the stalemate as capable of sowing seeds of discord and generating unrest among the peoples of the region. This could erupt into violence and threaten the stability of their own countries, as well as the peace and security of the world. In a year in which so many sharp modifications have occurred in other areas of tension, it would be to the general relief of the international community if the opponents in the Middle East were to rethink their positions and respond to the trends of world detente. The problems of the Middle East are highly emotional and complex and can be solved only by peaceful means and not by means of armed force. To our mind, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) continues to provide a sound basis for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem.\n16.\tAlthough there have been significant changes in the nature of the international system in the course of this year, three major features of the world that developed in the post-war period are destined to dominate the life of the international community for a considerable time. These are the issues of the prevention of nuclear war, the bridging of the economic gap between the developed and the developing nations, and the racial conflict over color. All three issues, which plague humanity, are matters of man's struggle for survival free from fear of the nuclear bomb and on the basis of equality and justice.\n17.\tThe Burmese delegation has always been of the view that the ultimate goal of the entire human race in the field of disarmament must be the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Indeed, we believe there is no alternative to that.\n18.\tBut, as we all know, general and complete disarmament raises a multiplicity of complex and delicate issues which strike at the very heart of the security and sovereignty of nations. It presupposes the existence of an effective system of universal collective security, without military alliances, such as that envisaged in the Charter as well as a further maturing of the spirit and ideals of internationalism. Therefore the achievement of general and complete disarmament would necessarily take time. In the circumstances, the Burmese delegation feels that the immediate efforts of the international community could more gainfully be directed towards achieving agreements on what are commonly referred to as collateral or partial measures of disarmament designed to contain and reduce the dimensions of the armaments problem and thereby to bring the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament that much nearer. In this context the Burmese delegation is of the view that arms control and disarmament measures related to weapons of mass destruction should be given first priority.\n19.\tThe ominous implications of nuclear weapons will continue to impinge upon our lives; and the foremost problem, the prevention of nuclear war, can be solved only through the pursuit of measures of arms control and disarmament specifically in the nuclear field. The life of man today is corroded by his fear of the nuclear weapon, which if let loose would mean his annihilation. A world dominated by nuclear-armed super-Powers is not a pleasant prospect and each small step those Powers take towards control of their nuclear weapons should be welcomed in the context of progress in the disarmament talks.\n20.\tThe first tentative opening towards limitation of their strategic arms has been made by the United States and the Soviet Union. The Moscow agreements of 26 May 1972 of those two foremost nuclear Powers on, respectively, the limitation of and a moratorium on their defensive and offensive strategic weapons provide prospects for the inauguration of further nuclear arms control and disarmament measures. In order to underpin the viability of the Moscow agreements on strategic arms limitation, the conclusion of an underground test-ban treaty has clearly assumed greater urgency, since such a measure can help arrest the further qualitative development of nuclear weapons. Burma would urge that the first productive outcome of the Moscow agreements should lie in the direction of a ban on underground nuclear tests to complement the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty and thus finally to achieve a comprehensive test ban.\n21.\tAnother matter which needs to be tackled with the utmost urgency is the elimination of chemical weapons from the arsenals of all States. In the view of the Burmese delegation the aim of the negotiations in this regard should clearly be the complete and effective prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of all types of chemical weapons and the total destruction of existing stockpiles, and the working out of the adequate and effective verification procedures that would make such a comprehensive prohibition possible. We therefore favor a comprehensive approach to the problem, since a partial approach cannot lead to a comprehensive solution.\n22.\tAs regards the task of bridging the economic gap between the developed and the developing nations-the situation of the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" all that can be said at present is that there is as yet no evidence of a break-through. Despite all the efforts at the national and international levels, the phenomenon of a widening disparity continues to exist. When the United Nations was conceived in 1945 it was not envisaged that the conscious aim set forth in the Preamble to the Charter \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in greater freedom\\\" would have special relevance to the developing nations. Few then gave so much as a thought to the possibility that the problem of the developing nations would assume primacy in the economic and social work of the United Nations. But two thirds of the world's population belong to the developing world and their physical needs have to be met and their hunger for human dignity satisfied.\n23.\tWe are all aware that the trends have not been in favor of the developing countries. The decline in their share of world exports, their rising burden of debt and their slow rate of growth are amply documented in United Nations reports, which bear testimony to the sad state of international co-operation in this field. The outcome of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ held at Santiago, Chile, also provides us with an important case in point. UNCTAD has been useful in providing a forum for the discussion of a wide range of economic problems of interest to the developing countries. It has no doubt helped to define the issues more clearly and, as a consequence, has contributed to a better understanding and appreciation of the problems of the developing countries. However, despite this greater understanding, a more concerted international effort to overcome the difficulties was not in evidence at the Santiago session. It is common knowledge that no significant progress was made on substantive issues and that the achievements fell far short of the aspirations of the Group of 77 developing countries as contained in the Lima Declaration. \n24.\tThe past year has also witnessed further upheavals on the international monetary scene. It is not necessary to emphasize here that a new and equitable international monetary arrangement to meet the needs of world trade and development is an urgent necessity at this time. We hope that such a system will soon be implemented with the full participation of all interested parties.\n25.\tIt would be an illusion to believe that the developing nations could catch up with the developed within a few decades. What is imperative, however, is a continuing narrowing of the gap, instead of a widening of it. Obviously, no nation can be developed solely from external resources; in the final analysis the prime mover in development will always have to be a country's own effort and its will to rely on its own resources. But, the world being interdependent, the problems of the developed and the developing are in a state of permanent interaction, and progress in development can be achieved only on the basis of collaboration between the two.\n26.\tAnother challenge of our times is the problem of racial conflict over color. Vestiges of the most virulent forms of colonialism and its concomitant evils, racism and racial discrimination, are still a live phenomenon which permeates the relation of man to man in certain parts of southern Africa. It is hardly necessary to stress that the subjection of peoples to alien domination and exploitation constitutes not only a violation of the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples but also a denial of fundamental human rights. TTie persistence of repressive measures to deprive peoples of still dependent Territories in southern Africa of their right to self-determination, freedom and independence is of growing concern. The situation there is one of conflict, with international ramifications. So long as the Governments concerned continue to react against the tide of world opinion, and so long as certain important PcweiS tend to indulge in covert evasion of United Nations sanctions, the tension in Africa is bound to increase both in range and in intensity and to impede the attainment of the United Nations ideal of peace and security.\n27.\tThe current worldwide movement of political and social changes will inevitably have their impact on the United Nations. The challenge the Organization is faced with may be greater than in the past and every effort will have to be made to strengthen and develop the United Nations in consonance with the changed conditions and needs of the world. The work of the United Nations must, therefore, be conceived and devised against that background. Significantly, the rigid power structures of the past are giving way to a diversity among nations and new power centers have emerged, allowing for greater freedom and flexibility among nations. Simply stated, this means that the time is not far off when the Charter of the United Nations will be due for revision and for adjustment to these broad forces. In dealing with the rising concerns of the population explosion, environmental pollution and ecological imbalance, the Organization's area of work and activities will continue to grow in volume and complexity and inevitably entail increased expenditures. If we are to succeed in them, it will be necessary for the United Nations to take appropriate steps and measures for a more rational division and co-ordination of work among its network of agencies and organizations, in order that the available financial resources of the Organization may be kept within reasonable and controllable frontiers. The Burmese delegation shares the general concern at the dour ting expenditure of the United Nations, particularly its administrative costs. We are therefore highly gratified that the Secretary-General has personally taken this matter in hand. We should like to commend him for the determined and decisive manner in which he has been enforcing economy measures in the Organization, which have already yielded considerable results, and to assure him of our support and co-operation in his further efforts in the same direction.\n28.\tIn conclusion, the Burmese delegation feels that the international community is now entering upon a new era of negotiation and accommodation, leaving behind an era of confrontation and conflict. The methods of diplomacy will in our view again become of vital importance to nations which seek to pursue their interests successfully and peacefully. There can be no doubt that, in solving international problems of a political, economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, multilateral diplomacy becomes a necessity. The United Nations, as the center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of that objective, is the best forum for the conduct of multilateral diplomacy. The Burmese delegation hopes that the major Powers will abandon their tendency to by-pass the United Nations in seeking solutions to international problems of vital importance and will make full use of the United Nations and its organs for this purpose. To the extent that the States Members of the United Nations actively participate in working out solutions to international problems, they are bound to have a greater sense of involvement and responsibility, thereby lending greater impetus and effectiveness to the work of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "May I be permitted first of all to express to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, our deep appreciation of the tact, the courtesy and the skill with which he conducted the work of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May we also assure him that he has our fullest admiration and best wishes.\n68.\tI should like now to address to our President the warmest congratulations of the Togolese delegation upon his brilliant election to the presidency of this session. No one doubts that his intellectual qualities, his vast experience in international affairs and his profound attachment to the cause of our Organization carried much weight with this Assembly when it made its choice.\n69.\tI could not fail to mention the eminent role played by our former Secretary-General, U Thant, who has left the powerful imprint of his personality on the life of our community. With respect to his successor, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, his designation by the twenty-sixth session was an inspiration which we applaud.\n70.\tSince our new Secretary-General took over his functions we have had only reason to congratulate ourselves on the considerable qualities of which he has given proof. His spirit of initiative, his courage and his devotion to the cause of peace are a guarantee of renewed faith in our Organization, which at present is suffering from a crisis of confidence and whose difficulties escape no one.\n71.\tWe have the feeling that these real and disquieting difficulties cannot be solved unless all the nations represented here work as a united family. In this connexion, the restoration of China's rights in our community during the last session constituted an outstanding event and a realistic approach to the solutions we seek. The cause of peace cannot be defended effectively without realism, nor rendered a lasting service without justice. Therefore it is desirable to adopt the same mental attitude towards the other problems unfortunately, very numerous because any other approach, such as the one that prevailed until then, could only lead to a stalemate.\n72.\tFor many years in fact our Organization has been confronted with the same difficulties, the majority of which have not been satisfactorily solved, on account of the lack of the necessary spirit of sincere co-operation and political will. Must we henceforward infer that each year the sessions of the General Assembly will be no more than constant failures and oratory of the highest moral standing with no greater significance than the words of Cassandra? The consideration of questions which for many years have been on the agenda of our sessions provides some foundation for these apprehensions.\n73.\tAs regards the Middle East drama, the reciprocal attachment of Togo to both the Arab countries and Israel incites us to desire for that region a just and durable peace. To us the return to peace requires the honest implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We demand for each State in the area concerned the recognition and respect of its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. We believe that the will recently manifested by the Arab Republic of Egypt, which led to a certain military disengagement by that country, makes possible a compromise solution in the near future, and we sincerely hope that soon Arabs and Jews may coexist in peace in that part of the world.\n74.\tWe are especially appreciative of any attempt which seeks through dialog to smooth over the difficulties between the countries. Agreement is the basis of the policy of His Excellency General Etienne Eyadema, President of the Togolese Republic, to which all the Togolese people in good faith pay a deserved tribute and which today enables them to enjoy in newly found peace the virtues of unity and spiritual reconciliation. That is why we wish here publicly to congratulate Chancellor Willy Brandt on his resolute policy of detente in Europe and of rapprochement towards his brothers in Eastern Germany, a policy to which the whole world unanimously paid a tribute by conferring on him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n75.\tWe also rejoice at the attempt recently undertaken by the two Koreas to endeavor to solve their problems themselves. It is the duty of our Assembly to help to create favorable conditions for the reunification of that painfully divided country. In their effort to find an agreement the two Koreas may rest assured of the support and sympathy of Togo. We must keep in mind the idea that divided peoples will always seek at any price to restore the links that history has created between them and that fortuitous events have broken.\n76.\tAs regards the Far East, we must not overlook the fact that at this time whole peoples live in conditions comparable to those of the Second World War. We must make an effort to awaken from our torpor, from our guilty indifference in the face of the VietNamese problem. Thousands of innocent people are subjected to a cruel, merciless war, to deadly and indiscriminate bombardments. Our Organization must no longer remain aloof from this problem; it must encourage and support every attempt at a settlement inasmuch as it is, unfortunately, powerless to impose a cessation of hostilities. We are convinced that pressure from this Organization and from world public opinion in the long run will be a factor of peace in the IndoChinese peninsula.\n77.\tThe position of my Government with regard to the problem of decolonization has not changed. Togo unreservedly supports the struggle of Territories still under foreign domination to shake off the colonial yoke. It is regrettable to note that, despite the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of 14 December 1960 [resolution 1514 (XV)], Portugal continues to subject the peoples of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) to barbarous, racist and anachronistic occupation. With the complicity of certain Member States which claim to be friends of Africa, that under-developed country finds the means and has the audacity to attack and violate the territorial integrity of certain African States. We, the African countries, are resolved to provide the freedom fighters with the necessary moral and material aid to rid our continent of the scourge of Portuguese colonial domination. The last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], held in Rabat from 12 to 15 June 1972, abundantly showed, if need be, our unremitting determination to do so.\n78.\tThe problem of racism in Rhodesia and South Africa still constitutes a serious preoccupation for our Organization. In this connexion we must applaud the happy initiative taken this year by our Secretary-General. While the results achieved are not yet those we desire, we are nevertheless in duty bound to recognize that that mission was not entirely negative. Nevertheless, we must not be excessively optimistic, because the country of apartheid, which has not renounced an iota of its racist philosophy, has never taken much notice of the resolutions of our Assembly and shows an arrogant and absurd contempt for world public opinion. It is, however, to be hoped that common sense and realism will prevail in the end and that the racists of South Africa will understand that peace is not nurtured by continued expedients.\n79.\tAs regards Rhodesia, we are happy at the decision recently taken by the International Olympic Committee to refuse to allow that country to participate in the games in Munich, which we believe is in keeping both with the resolutions of our Organization and of the OAU. This irrefutably demonstrates that the loyal application by Member States of the sanctions promulgated against that country would represent an important step forward towards the solution of the Rhodesian problem.\n80.\tMy Government attaches great importance to the problem of disarmament. World peace and security cannot be safeguarded so long as controlled disarmament is not achieved. That is why we most strongly demand the convening, as soon as possible, of a world conference on this burning question, because the race in engines of death not only threatens world peace, but also uselessly deprives a large part of mankind of greater assistance for development.\n81.\tAt the beginning of the Second United Nations Development Decade, the major preoccupation of the developing world is still its economic development. Certain preliminary signs lead us to anticipate the possible failure of the main objectives embodied in the International Development Strategy for the Second Development Decade.\n82.\tThe first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, held in Geneva in 1964, defined great possibilities for action which aroused great and genuine hopes in our countries.\n83.\tTrue, some very minor progress in 1968 can be credited to the second session of UNCTAD. But we must also acknowledge that in the absence of an international policy likely in the long run to improve the export earnings of the developing countries, the latter have registered only negative results as regards the expansion of their exports. Further still, last year's monetary crisis very seriously disrupted our already precarious economies, compelling us thus to assume the consequences of a situation for which we were in no way responsible.\n84.\tThe prospects of the third session of UNCTAD awakened in the poorer countries the hopes of which we are all aware. In fact, those countries were convinced that in the course of that important meeting the developed countries at long last would become aware of their responsibilities and would help them find appropriate solutions to their multiple development problems.\n85.\tOnce again, we must express our bitter disappointment at the results of the third session. Neither at New Delhi in 1968 nor at Santiago in 1972 were the developed countries willing to give proof of that indispensable solidarity that should normally bind the members of our international community, as laid down in tKe Charter of our Organization. Once again they regarded our just claims as mere children's whims and refused to grant any concession likely to offer the beginning of a solution to our economic difficulties.\n86.\tSuch an attitude is incompatible with the decision taken by those countries within the framework of the Second Development Decade. It is true that actually those countries, instead of subscribing to firm commitments, rather gave their marked preference to recommendations formulated in vague terms, without obligations or sanctions, as if to disengage themselves of any responsibility in a matter with which they no longer felt concerned. It is therefore not surprising that the poor or unfavorable treatment that the developed countries persist in imposing on our primary commodities on the world market contributes to a large degree to the continued deterioration in the terms of trade, thus depriving us of substantial export earnings indispensable for the balanced development of our economies. Our agricultural primary commodities encounter difficulties of every kind on the international market: marketing difficulties, instability of prices, competition from synthetics, and so on. Yet it is from these products that our countries draw their main resources.\n87.\tIt is high time for the international community seriously to tackle this problem, the solution of which is becoming urgent. For nine years the cocoa-producing countries have been awaiting the outcome of negotiations\nthat should lead to the conclusion of an international cocoa agreement. In my country's economy this product holds a very important place, and the nefarious effects of its price fluctuations on our budgetary earnings can be readily\nunderstood. Now that it would appear that all the technical conditions for an agreement exist, we address a pressing appeal to the consumer countries to show sufficient political will in order to arrive, as soon as possible, at the\nconclusion of an arrangement that will take into account the vital interests of the producer countries by guaranteeing to\nthem a just, remunerative and stable price.\n88.\tThe recent monetary crisis which created so much disruption throughout the world shows, if need be, the urgent necessity of reforming the international monetary system. We believe, as advocated by UNCTAD, that the new monetary system should, in the interest of the developing countries, help to create conditions in which the export trade of the developing countries could expand and diversify; could take into account a transfer of resources in an amount equivalent to that mentioned in the International Development Strategy, namely 1 per cent of the national gross product, and could include financial assistance abroad, the modalities of which could be established on the occasion of the restructuring of the system.\n89.\tWe reaffirm that it is through concerted international action, which would take into account the interests of all Member States and more especially those of the poorer countries in the international community, that an equitable and lasting solution could be found.\n90.\tMy country is gratified at the efforts of UNCTAD to help the least developed among the developing countries. The identification of these countries, we know, is no easy task. The Trade and Development Board has taken a decisive step by preparing a list of countries forming a nucleus. Continuing efforts must be made in order to define such criteria more clearly and to analyze them with greater objectivity and justice, while taking into account all the significant factors of under-development. We believe it necessary no longer to overlook the dynamic character of the life of States and to proceed to periodic stock-taking within the framework of the International Development Strategy. Only flexibility will ensure equity in this area.\n91.\tMy delegation could not fail to mention the results of the important United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm last June. We must become fully aware of the gravity of the problems posed by industrial pollution and recognize that it is one of the greatest scourges of modern times. But we must recognize that there is no greater pollution than the poverty, malnutrition, disease, racism, and so on, threatening the environment and two-thirds of mankind.\n92.\tTo national and temporary solutions, which perforce are insufficient and inoperative, we must prefer solutions at the world level.\n93.\tWe have no doubt that the serious problems of the environment with which we are at present confronted are the inevitable consequences of economic growth. However, these dangers inherent in scientific and technological progress must not prevent or delay the industrial development of our countries.\n94.\tThe fundamental principles enunciated in the Declaration of the Conference and in the various resolutions adopted at that Conference  are such as to serve as the basis for the preparation of adequate international measures, in conformity with the United Nations Charter and respect for human rights, with a view to helping the developing countries to take advantage of the industrialization possibilities they are offered while minimizing the risks of degradation of the environment.\n95.\tMy delegation approves the idea of the creation of an international institution and of a special Environment Fund. In our view this fund should be based on voluntary contributions and should be supported by taxes on the polluting industries. The wealthy countries must defray the cost of the protection of their environment and help the poor countries in their struggle against such problems while at the same time they should not reduce the assistance they provide.\n96.\tThe fundamental objectives provided for within the framework of the Second Development Decade will not be effectively achieved except through concerted action which, if effectively carried out, will undoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of international peace and the establishment of a new economic order.\n97.\tThis new economic order is but an element in the new order that all countries, each year in this Assembly, call for with all their strength. For this dream to become a reality, all that is needed is the will and the spirit of solidarity, whose virtues everyone is so prone to acknowledge, of States in our community, particularly those whose wealth and power impose upon them special responsibilities for the maintenance of peace. But it is not necessary to succeed to persevere, according to a famous adage. But to persevere we must first begin. In other words, we must want change in order to achieve a more just and prosperous world for all."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the twenty-seventh annual session of the General Assembly having been placed under your presidency, it is my pleasure to congratulate you, on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, upon your unanimous election to your high office. We salute in you, Sir, not only an eminent representative from a country with which the Netherlands shared war-time experiences -a Polish division took part in the liberation of the Netherlands in the last part of the Second World War- but also a prominent representative of another medium-sized European Power actively engaged in the search for ways and means of promoting a political detente in our part of the world.\n2.\tI should be remiss if I did not pay a tribute, on behalf of the Netherlands delegation, to Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, who presided over our previous annual session with all the courtesy, forbearance, grace and sagacity that characterize the Indonesian people.\n3.\tIt is also my pleasant duty to address a personal word of welcome to the Secretary-General and to Under-Secretary-General Morse, both of whom are gracing the podium for the first time.\n4.\tAlthough I am speaking exclusively on behalf of the Netherlands, and not on behalf of the European community, I stress the European accent of my views, firstly because I do not wish to approach the problems before this Assembly from a purely national standpoint and, secondly, because at this moment the Netherlands has the privilege of presiding over the Council of Ministers of the European Community. The part of the world to which my country belongs is undergoing significant economic and political changes-not that we are without economic difficulties. Inflation, stagnation, unemployment all these evils beset us from time to time. Their effect should not be under-estimated, but I feel confident that in due course and through a better common effort we shall overcome them.\nIn general the Common Market has proved to be of great benefit to its members; there will be, and there can be, no way back.\n5.\tThis morning we were delighted to learn the results of the Danish referendum. The enlargement of the European Community by three new partners, which in our opinion constitutes a break-through of importance not only to us but to the world as a whole, is more limited in scope than we in the Netherlands had hoped. The doors to the Community remain open to democratic countries interested in admission and willing to subscribe to the treaties. The greater European Community as it is to be constituted soon will comprise more than 250 million people with, in general, a very high level of economic and social development, with a vast commercial, industrial, scientific, educational and technological potential, with an outgoing interest in the rest of the world, and with no political or military axes to grind. The harmonization of foreign policies among the European partners will develop as time goes on, and thus enable Europe to play an effective and constructive role in the world. We are approaching this political co-operation pragmatically, but the prospects, in the light of our experiences, look promising.\n6.\tEurope does not want to isolate itself from the world as a whole; nor do we want to become a new super-Power. What we do want is to develop our responsibilities, both towards our own peoples and towards other countries and, more particularly, towards the developing world. You may safely assume that the European Common Market will play an ever more important part in global co-operation for economic development. In this connexion I may point out that the Council of Ministers of the Community, together with the European Commission, last week devoted an extensive discussion, for the first time, to the attitude of the Common Market towards development co-operation.\n7.\tEurope, of course, is more than the countries of the European Community. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AI8701/Add.l] the Secretary-General has pointed out the developments toward detente on the continent of Europe. We the members of the European Community and its prospective members, as well as our other friends and allies, welcome this development. We are convinced of the need for co-operation between Western and Eastern Europe. Preparations for the convening of a conference on security and co-operation in Europe are getting under way. I hope that in the course of this year it will be possible to start the multilateral preparatory talks which are necessary to ascertain whether the conference can yield tangible results-whether, in other words, the conference will enhance and increase security and trust for all parties concerned, both for individual \ncountries within the present alliances and between the groupings as a whole. In harmony with the conference on European security and co-operation there will be the need for negotiations on mutual balanced force reductions. Indeed, without the complement of a mutual reduction of forces a conference on European security would make no sense.\n8.\tMy Government is looking forward to a positive outcome of all these negotiations, which may result in growing economic, scientific, technological and cultural co-operation. Most important of all, I hope that they will lead to a greater understanding among all the peoples of Europe, who, in our view, must be assured of freedom of movement and of a free exchange of information and ideas.\n9.\tBut again, even the whole of Europe does not live in isolation. Europe is only a part of the world, and we Europeans have to play our role and to assume our responsibilities in a global context. For the Netherlands three points are essential. In the first place manifestations of violence must be curbed, both on the level of States and on the level of individuals and groups; in the second place the forces of justice, reason and moderation must be strengthened by world-wide co-operation through the United Nations in all its facets; and in the third place the forces of economic and social growth must be regulated in order to achieve a fairer distribution of wealth and improved standards of living in the world. I should like to elaborate on these three points.\n10.\tIn the case of Governments, the curbing of the means of violence in the first place implies arms control and disarmament. The Netherlands takes an active part in the disarmament deliberations in Geneva; we know that results can be attained only after long and patient discussions. The framework of disarmament talks is now under discussion. We may reform the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, we may have a world disarmament conference, we may choose any other suitable framework, but it has now become essential that the principal Powers, especially the five nuclear Powers, the permanent members of the Security Council, should participate in those discussions.\n11.\tIn the field of disarmament I wish to emphasize, once again, the importance of concluding an agreement for the cessation of underground nuclear-weapon tests. During the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly the Netherlands delegation expressed the hope that such an agreement might be reached within a year. I deeply regret that those hopes have not materialized. With regard to the question of on-site inspection, the rapid progress of seismology and the sophistication of its technology point towards increasing possibilities for control by national means. I therefore call upon the Powers concerned to take account of this development in order to achieve the comprehensive ban which, in our view, is long overdue. At the same time I repeat our urgent plea to all nuclear-weapon Powers to stop testing in all environments.\n12.\tConcern about the nuclear arms race should not blind us to the urgency of reducing conventional arms as well. The accumulation and the proliferation of conventional armaments create and increase tensions in many parts of the world and divert resources from the promotion of social and economic goals. In this connexion I want to express, in particular, our concern about the increasing trade, including the second-hand trade, in conventional weapons and military equipment. It is extremely difficult to come to grips with this problem, because many aspects political and economic are involved. Nevertheless, I should like to appeal to supplying, trading and receiving countries to consider entering into consultations with a view to finding ways of stemming this alarming development.\n13.\tThe problems of curbing violence confront us inevitably with the remaining conflicts in the world. The Middle East, for instance, still presents a bleak picture, in spite of the praiseworthy efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, Ambassador Jarring, and many others. The Netherlands Government remains profoundly interested in a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and in the search for an equitable and mutually acceptable solution.\n14.\tIn our view, neither criminal acts such as the Munich outrage nor military retaliatory actions can advance the search for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. In general terms I wish to emphasize the urgent need for the prevention of acts of international terrorism, wherever they occur. I am grateful to the Secretary-General for his initiative to discuss this subject during the session of this Assembly. In the last few years we have tackled one aspect of terrorism, namely, the hijacking of airplanes. The Netherlands has ratified the Tokyo Convention  and the ratification procedure for the Conventions of Montreal and The Hague  is well under way. We urge other Governments to speed up, too, their ratification procedures. When studying measures against terrorism in its different forms, we will have to look, too, at the underlying causes, and the possibilities of eliminating them. We will have to look at the whole problem, without political bias and in the spirit of a common effort to stop the wanton killing of human beings and the resulting deterioration of international relations. In this spirit my delegation will give its full support to the search for a sensible solution of this intricate problem.\n15.\tThe second point -after dealing with the forces of violence- I mentioned as being essential for the United Nations is the strengthening of the forces of justice, reason and moderation. This, of course, involves the actual functioning of the United Nations. Here I must say that, as in many other countries, elections will be held in the Netherlands before long. As in any democratic country, controversies on many issues are rampant. However, there is no controversy in the Netherlands about the question of support of the United Nations. Therefore I know that I am on safe ground when I pledge, on behalf of the Netherlands people, our unrelenting support for strengthening the structures of world-wide co-operation. An arresting subject of further study in this context might be, in the Netherlands view, the modernization, adaptation and improvement of the process of international legislation.\n16.\tOne hundred and thirty two nations are now represented in this Assembly and we hope that in the near future others may join us in order to turn the principle of universality into reality. Different traditions, varying systems of government and diverging opinions on the problems before the world are guiding us. This remains the inescapable basis of reality in our Organization and this reflects on its effectiveness. We in the Netherlands do not believe that the resulting problems can be solved by a general revision of the Charter. We may adapt Articles of the Charter, whenever circumstances warrant it, but the Charter as a whole must stand as long as the political world situation remains essentially unchanged. To make our Organization more efficient we might devise better conference techniques. Moreover, we might for instance look into the desirability of keeping the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in some form of permanent session to meet the demands of our times.\n17.\tLast year I advocated the optimal use of the resources and talents available to the United Nations in the Secretariat. The top of the Secretariat has now undergone changes. I wish to assure the Secretary-General that he may always count on the support and the understanding of my Government in his efforts to streamline the Secretariat and to raise its level of competence wherever feasible. One aspect of strengthening the role of the United Nations is, in my opinion, a more effective policy of information on the work done by the United Nations family on all levels.\n18.\tHow do we see the role of the Secretary-General in this whole context? Briefly, my Government looks at the Secretary-General's office in the following light. The Secretary-General is the servant of an Organization of 132 Member States and, in questions of security, the servant of the Security Council. In these matters he has little freedom of action or room for maneuvering. This point is illustrated by the unresolved question of peace-keeping operations. In April of this year the Netherlands made some suggestions in order to try to bridge the differences between those who would like to stress an independent role for the Secretary-General and those who stressed the preponderance of the Security Council for all aspects of those operations. In principle we subscribe to the preponderance of the Security Council, but at the same time we think that a workable way out can be found without infringing principles.\n19.\tIn peace-keeping operations the Secretary-General can, in our view, have only limited responsibilities.\n20.\tHowever, that is one side of the picture. The other side is that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, because of his function, has an independent responsibility to speak up and to try to initiate action whenever, in his opinion, great humanitarian problems are involved. I completely agree with the following words used by Mr. Waldheim in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"No matter what criticisms or setbacks may arise, the unwritten moral responsibility which every Secretary- General bears does not allow him to turn a blind eye when innocent civilian lives are placed in jeopardy on a large scale. [A/8701/Add. 1, p. 4.]\n21.\tMy Government is profoundly concerned over the increasing violation of human rights and the resulting human suffering in various parts of the world. It would be unforgivable if the international community allowed cruelty, terror and other infringements of human rights to go by without comment.\n22.\tTherefore, the General Assembly will also have to discuss, once again and with even more insistence, the policy of apartheid in South Africa and the problem of decolonization which still besets the continent of Africa. Progress towards the elimination of apartheid is essential for peaceful development. A meaningful dialog to this end would be of particular importance for the promotion of a solution deemed urgent and indispensable by the world community. As to the decolonization of the few remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in Africa, my delegation fears that, irrespective of the right of self-determination to which all peoples are entitled under the Charter, further refusals by the Government of Portugal to embark on constructive planning for eventual decolonization will inevitably play into the hands of the forces of violence.\n23.\tComing now to the third point which we see as vital for the role of the Netherlands in the United Nations, I wish to speak on the subject of regulating the forces of economic and social growth in the world, of achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity among the peoples of the world and greater possibilities for human well-being, or and here I would refer to the terminology used by the Foreign Minister of Brazil of achieving a system of collective economic security, an idea which deserves further consideration and study.\n24.\tTwo years have passed since the adoption by the General Assembly of the International Development Strategy for The Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and today doubts have arisen over the prospects of realizing the objectives and the targets of the Strategy, as a result of the expected shortfall in official development assistance in relation to the targets set in the Strategy. There is, however, no reason to dismiss the Strategy or to lose faith in the Second Development Decade.\n25.\tOn the contrary, the Strategy was in fact drafted as a dynamic instrument, adaptable to new circumstances and to change, and it was recognized from the outset that periodic review and adjustment would be required. Thus, while the basic objectives and philosophy of the Strategy, as a new framework for world-wide economic co-operation based on freely accepted rights and duties of States, remain unchanged, the need is now clearly felt for enlarging its contents and for adjusting it to a number of new elements which have emerged since its adoption.\n26.\tI refer in the first place to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, which has confronted the United Nations system and its Member nations with a new dimension of economic growth and co-operation, namely, with the imperative need to preserve and enhance the human environment. The Conference and its results were in themselves a milestone in the history of the United Nations, to the extent that the United Nations system proved its capacity to tackle new and vital problems, to devise new machinery for dealing with these problems and to integrate this dimension of economic development into the already existing broader framework of United Nations objectives and activities. Stockholm, however, was a beginning; the Development Strategy adopted in 1970 did not sufficiently take into account the problems of the human environment, and it has now become necessary to set new objectives for the preservation and enhancement of the human environment, relating them, in particular, to the economic development of developing countries.\n27.\tA second new element emerged at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], which met at Santiago in April and May and which projected a new vision of the world-wide interdependence between monetary problems and the problems of the economic development of the developing nations and of the structure of international trade. In this field, too, the International Development Strategy needs elaboration and adjustment. A most important new element in development is the deeply rooted problem of mass poverty in developing countries and its traditional attributes: unemployment, malnutrition, slums, lack of minimum hygiene, lack of education and glaring inequalities in standards of living. The Committee for Development Planning and, last week, Mr. de Seynes, the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, and Mr. McNamara, the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, have brought this new conceptual context to the attention of the world. They have recommended that both developing and developed countries and international organizations take a bold approach in tackling this problem and they have thus replaced the traditional statistical approach of per capita growth by a new concept which places human well-being in all its aspects in the center of development policy. There is an urgent necessity to integrate the concept of mass poverty and unemployment into the Development Strategy and to try to set objectives and, if possible, targets for its elimination.\n28.\tIn addition to those three new elements, I wish to mention the progress which has recently been made in deepening our understanding of and our possibilities for drafting policies with regard to the problem of the least developed countries and the relationship between growth, prosperity and population. In respect of the least developed countries UNCTAD at its third session adopted important recommendations and it may be necessary also in this field to rethink some of the concepts embodied in the development Strategy.\n29.\tWith regard to population, it is encouraging to note that the United Nations Fund for Population Activities is expanding its activities. For 1974, that is to say, one year before the mid-term review and appraisal, it is expected that the World Population Year and the World Population Conference, 1974, will enable us to deepen our understanding of the highly complicated, and at the same time delicate, problem of population. In our view, it is essential that we should increase our understanding and our capacity to deal with the problem in relation to development, both at the national and at the international levels.\n30.\tLast, but not least, there remains the inescapable fact that official development assistance is expected to fall short of the target set in the Strategy. As I pointed out, the International Development Strategy was drafted as a dynamic instrument and it recognized, from the outset, the need for review and appraisal. The United Nations system is fortunate to have now at its disposal the broad framework of a machinery for review and appraisal which will enable it to adjust the Strategy to the new trends and new facts which I have just mentioned. This adaptation will perhaps have to lead to new objectives and targets for the fulfillment of the aims of the Strategy or the reaffirmation of accepted targets, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that individual Governments and all the organs of the United Nations family alike prepare themselves thoroughly for the first experimental review and appraisal, to take place in 1973, and particularly for the mid-term review of 1975.\n31.\tThe United Nations and its affiliated organizations have in recent years assumed new tasks and new activities and, as a result, the United Nations structure and the co-ordination between its different organs have become increasingly complicated. It therefore seems desirable to us that, parallel to the review and appraisal of the basic concepts and objectives of the International Development Strategy, a review should be undertaken of the institutional structure of the United Nations. This review should be carried out against the background of the provisions of the Charter which have assigned to the Economic and Social Council a central, policy-making and co-ordinating role as well as against the background of subsequent General Assembly decisions setting up new organs like UNCTAD, the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.\n32.\tI have tried to explain how my country approaches the important problems before this Assembly. I have stressed the development of the responsibilities of the European Powers, not only among themselves, but also to other countries and, in particular, to the developing part of the world. This is not an exclusive responsibility of a few. The development towards a world community is, and has to be, a common effort of all countries represented in this hall.\n33.\tMay God's blessing rest on this joint effort and on the labors of this session!\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like, on behalf of the Australian delegation, to add my congratulations upon your election as President of this General Assembly session. Our two countries are far apart geographically, but our peoples have had some common experiences which have given them, I believe, a respect and understanding of each other. With the exchange this year of diplomatic representatives, the relations between our two countries are entering a period of constructive and fruitful development. In your high office, to which you come with distinction and obvious talent, you may be assured of the full co-operation of the Australian delegation.\n121.\tI wish also to express my warm appreciation of the contribution made by the President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, who brought to the office of President great charm and distinction, as well as wise counsel. Australia and Indonesia are close neighbors and we take special pleasure in recalling Mr. Malik's presidency.\n122.\tMay I be permitted also to commend the dedication to his task that the Secretary-General has shown in his first year of office. The Australian delegation appreciates his distillation of the essence of his report in a short introduction. In this introduction [A/8701IAdd.l] he has set forth his determination to work actively for peaceful solutions to international problems. Most of what he has said in that brief explanation of his conception of the duties and objectives of the United Nations, and of his own responsibilities, will be accepted without qualification by my Government.\n123.\tAustralia has been, not an uncritical, but a strong and consistent supporter of the United Nations. The purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter are basic to our foreign policy. This year Australia has decided to stand for election to membership in the Security Council. This is evidence of our willingness to accept our share of the general responsibilities of United Nations membership and of our belief that we can represent in a significant sense the Asian and Pacific region.\n124.\tThroughout our participation in the work of this Organization, Australia has sought to find ways by which the Charter and the United Nations as an institution can be used more effectively for reducing world tensions and for bringing increased harmony and stability into the international system. We do not seek a simply static world order; we seek one which can encompass even rapid change. But we firmly believe that change should take place always in a peaceful and orderly way. Most nations will acknowledge that the United Nations has not yet made sufficient progress in stabilizing international political relations within a generally acceptable code of international rules. Around the world we continue to face the tragic results of attempts to settle disputes and impose political solutions by force and terror and violence.\n125.\tWe believe that the functioning of any society of men or nations, if it is to be peaceably and soundly based, must depend upon the effective working of a rule of law that is generally understood, generally accepted and generally respected. It is true to say that the work of the United Nations rests on the twin pillars of international law and justice. There can be no more constructive way of contributing to the strength of the United Nations than to look for opportunities of broadening and deepening its involvement in new areas of common international concern, with the object of widening the scope and, I would hope, the acceptability of a just and realistic code of international behavior.\n126.\tWe have before us the question whether the Charter might need some revision. We all have in mind that it was drawn up at the end of the Second World War in circumstances that have since undergone substantial transformation. We can all agree that the Charter falls short of perfection. But as an enduring statement of political concepts and values, it has stood the test of time remarkably well. Its potential for practical implementation that will lead us to a well-ordered world system is still very far from exhausted. \n127.\tMy Government would be prepared to support amendments to specific Articles of the Charter which might now be out of date or in other respects now irrelevant, if there were a substantial measure of agreement on the proposed changes. That might be reason to question, for example, whether the wording of Article 23, paragraph 1, makes it possible to ensure that the original intent of that provision is carried out in full. We are not, however, attracted to the idea of wholesale review. There are too many differences of opinion for such a review to be certainly profitable. We would not favor the convening of a large conference which might result in division and dissension and which might even diminish respect for the present Charter without offering any certain prospect of an acceptable alternative. The damage to the United Nations could well be difficult to repair.\n128.\tThe program of work for this session offers us opportunities to help the United Nations to establish a world system in which agreed international laws and practices will prevail. Not all of these are equally mature for treatment by this General Assembly, but each offers some scope for removing inequalities and harmonizing relations between States.\n129.\tThe maintenance of international peace and security must remain the basic purpose of the United Nations. Australia, for its part, continues to be actively involved in United Nations peace-keeping functions, both in the field and here at Headquarters. As a member of the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations, we regret the failure of the Committee to make any substantial progress in recent years and its virtual stagnation during 1972. It is an unhappy commentary on the state of multilateral diplomacy within our Organization that the impasse reached on matters of substance is such that Members can conceive and develop no initiative which may offer a possible breakthrough and enable the Committee to carry out its mandate.\n130.\tSo long as we are unable to keep the peace, Governments will feel they need to go armed in a potentially hostile world. The crushing burden and the gruesome threat of modern armories are thus a symptom of our failure to create the well-ordered world system which remains the basic purpose of the United Nations. This in the final analysis must await agreement on effective measures of arms limitation and control. In respect of the items on this year's agenda, Australia will continue to support any genuinely constructive measures that promise to contribute to the climate of world peace.\n131.\tIn this spirit, the Australian Government welcomes the fact that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have advanced to agreement, if not yet to finality. We welcome the entry into force of the treaty on arms control on the sea-bed. Australia was also able to sign on 10 April last, the day on which it was opened for signature, the Convention to ban biological weapons of war.  We would also certainly support the convening, at the appropriate time and after full and careful preparation, of a world disarmament conference that could bring together all nations, and particularly all those more powerful nations whose consensus will be imperative in the words of the Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\n132.\tAustralia would particularly like to see the negotiation of a comprehensive treaty, with effective provisions for verification and control, to prohibit the conduct of nuclear weapons testing in all environments by all States. The first step towards that objective should be, in our view, the universal acceptance and application of the existing Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water. But we still do not have universal acceptance of this treaty, and there is still no halt to nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere.\n133.\tThose peoples, including my own, that live in and around the Pacific Ocean have made clear their strong opposition to these tests. Australia and New Zealand have taken a joint initiative in calling together a meeting of nations bordering on the Pacific Ocean that have raised their voices against nuclear weapons testing for the purpose of discussing this matter. Our first meeting proved constructive and useful. We hope, as a result, that we shall, with a substantial body of sponsors, be able to bring forward a meaningful resolution at an appropriate time during the current session.\n134.\tI move now from nuclear terror to plain human terror. In saying this I am, of course, aware that a debate has already taken place here on the question whether or not this Assembly should embark upon a discussion of terrorism and how to put an end to it.\n135.\tMy Government welcomed the initiative of the Secretary-General in seeking the inclusion in the agenda of an item designed to give us an opportunity to discuss terrorism [A/8791 and Add.lJ. This item has been included [item 92]. It is for all of us now to seek practical and effective ways of containing terrorism. The Secretary- General has rightly stressed the humanitarian aspects of the problem, and particularly its impact on innocent bystanders and non-participants.\n136.\tI want to make it clear that I do not have in mind any one particular terrorist act. My Government understands fully the kinds of frustration, grievance and despair that can lead particular groups and individuals to embark on desperate enterprises designed to hold persons, often innocent persons, or even Governments to ransom. But there are two things that must be said about the growing incidence of this world-wide pattern of intimidation by terrorism, whether it takes the form of the abduction or killing of diplomats or private individuals, or the hijacking of aircraft, or political assassination. The first is that however deplorable it is that disputes between groups or countries should escalate to the point of violence and terrorism, it becomes intolerable when the side effects of these disputes begin to appear in the harassment of Governments and the endangering of the lives of innocent people in countries that are not involved, and have no reason to be involved, in those disputes. The second point I want to make is that terror creates terror, that terrorism does not solve problems but breeds more terrorism within and among nations. If terrorism is allowed to go unchecked it must lead ultimately towards anarchy, national as well as international. It is, therefore, a matter of concern to every Member of the United Nations. The reputation of the United Nations as a whole will be gravely affected if the Organization is seen to shrink from facing the problem.\n137.\tThe Australian Government, in consultation with other Governments, has been examining possible ways of countering terrorist violence against innocent parties. We hope that the Assembly will treat this as a matter of urgency and reach early agreement on measures that may take us at least part of the way towards the solution of a problem which we recognize is full of difficulty for many Member countries, but which nevertheless demands immediate action. Looking further ahead, my delegation has had in mind the possibility of an international convention aimed at outlawing acts of violence and intimidation which arise essentially from local conflicts but which are in effect directed primarily at innocent people and uninvolved Governments. The problem is full of complexity, and there is more than one way of tackling it. The United States Secretary of State has put before us a draft convention on the subject [A/C.6/L.850], which we shall all of us wish to study with great care. Another possible suggestion that my Government has had in mind is that the International Law Commission might be asked to draft the provisions of such a convention. But these proposals are for the longer term, and are no substitute for the urgent action that is demanded by public and private opinion everywhere for effective preventive measures to defeat the indiscriminate threat of terrorism.\n138.\tThe threat is universal. It has reached us in Australia in forms no less grave than elsewhere. A bomb that exploded two weeks ago in a main street of our biggest city, at the entrance of an agency of a European Government, left 16 innocent people injured, some of them critically. Only two days ago some half-dozen of the so-called letter bombs were discovered in the central post office in Canberra. I mention both these incidents only to show how the manifestations of terrorism germinated from local grievances in any quarter of the world can threaten innocent people in countries many thousands of miles away.\n139.\tMy Government regards all acts of that kind as utterly abhorrent to our way of life. When acts of terrorism occur in Australia, we are determined to use all our resources to apprehend and prosecute the offenders. We are equally determined that, so far as it lies within our power, we will prevent our country from being used at any time as a base for terrorist acts in any other country. We join other nations in condemning not only acts of terrorism, but also those acts of violent retaliation, understandable as they may be, which in themselves carry the seeds of escalation into further terrorism.\n140.\tThe increasing incidence of aircraft hijacking and other kinds of criminal interference with air travel constitutes only one manifestation of the insidious effects of terror by example. More often than not its effects reach beyond the limits of jurisdiction of any single country. This means that it can be contained and ultimately eradicated only by a stringent combination of domestic and internationally agreed penalties. A beginning has been made in the form of the conclusion of three Conventions to deal with this problem, all three of which my Government has either ratified or is in the process of ratifying. But there is obviously more to be done before innocent travelers in every country in the world can feel sure that they can take to the air without the risk of placing their lives at the mercy of human terror.\n141.\tI think we all recognize that a well-ordered system of international behavior depends not only on dedication to accepted and established principles but also on the measure of detailed agreement we can reach on the many practical matters that affect the daily transactions of peoples and governments everywhere.\n142.\tOne of these practical matters concerns the seas and the resources that lie in and underneath them. The United Nations is now preparing for a conference on the law of the sea. This conference could be one of the most important of this decade. The Australian Government, as a member of the committee responsible for preparing this conference, is pleased at the progress the committee has made.\n143.\tWe welcome the growing acceptance in that committee of the view that the new law of the sea should accord greater recognition than is at present given by international law to the interests of coastal States in the resources, the quality of the environment, and the conduct of scientific research in the seas and sea-bed adjacent to them but beyond their territorial waters. If this is reflected in the final convention, it should be possible to confine the Territorial sea to a breadth of 12 miles and to devise a satisfactory regime for passage through straits used for international navigation. This would be a progressive development of the law, in the best sense.\n144.\tWe have spoken of our desire for a peaceful and well-ordered world. We also want a world in which the preservation of a healthy environment goes hand in hand with material progress. Australia recognizes the need for international conventions in this field, most immediately in the field of control over marine pollution. We look forward to further progress as a result of the Conference on Marine Pollution to be organized by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization in 1973, and from the continuing valuable studies of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n145.\tThe most significant achievement so far in our efforts to preserve the global environment has, of course, been the encouraging outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm. Australia will support the adoption by the General Assembly of the Conference's reports and the recommendations contained therein. At the same time we remain conscious of the fears among developing countries that the preservation of the environment might come to assume priority within the United Nations over the continuing need for assistance for .economic development. And we respect this concern. We consider that protection of the environment and economic development must go hand in hand, and must not be regarded as mutually exclusive or competitive.\n146.\tAustralia supports the proposal to establish a governing council for environmental programs.  I believe that Australia can make a valuable contribution to the work of this Council. We will seek election to that body at this session of the Assembly and we have already announced a pledge of $2.5 million to the voluntary Environment Fund.\n147.\tI have so far be ^n dealing with matters which directly affect us all. I should now like to bring to the Assembly some of the significant developments affecting international relations in the Asian and Pacific region.\n148.\tOne of the most exciting developments in our own area is the rapid movement towards self-government and independence of Papua New Guinea. The third Papua New Guinea House of Assembly was elected in March of this year and has now voted in favor of Papua New Guinea becoming fully self-governing on 1 December 1973 or as soon as possible thereafter. Independence will follow when the House of Assembly decides the time is right. The transition to independence by a people is an inspiring and important achievement, and I hope that the close and friendly relationship that continues between Australia and Papua New Guinea will provide convincing evidence of success in our efforts in helping to bring that country to the point of self-determination.\n149.\tIt is a short step from Papua New Guinea to the islands of the South Pacific ocean, and just before coming to New York I attended in Suva the third meeting of the South Pacific Forum, in which Government leaders of independent countries in the region now meet regularly to review common problems. It was agreed at the Suva meeting that countries like Papua New Guinea which were on the threshold of self-government or independence and wished to become members of the Forum could participate as observers until such time as they became self-governing or independent. Papua New Guinea will consequently be able to attend the next meeting of the South Pacific Forum as an observer.\n150.\tThis Forum, offering, as it does, an opportunity for frank discussion and consultation on the widest range of common problems, has already become a significant and influential regional body. The Pacific countries are actively seeking understanding and co-operation through consultation. Their efforts are a conspicuous example of the effective application of the principles of the United Nations Charter. As an indication of Australia's interest in assisting the countries of the South Pacific we have increased our development aid to the region to the figure of $A 15 million over the next three years.\n151.\tI have devoted some little time to Australia's relations with the island communities to our east, across the South Pacific, mainly because all those communities are now beginning to establish their own individual identity. This does not, of course, mean that there has been any diminution in the constant attention we in Australia give to our relations with our neighbor countries to our north to the countries of South-East and East Asia. These relationships continue to prosper in the same frank and cordial atmosphere that has prevailed since they achieved independence. Our bilateral relations with each of them are good. We enjoy very satisfactory multilateral associations with a number of them; and they are establishing closer links among and between themselves through organizations such as ASEAN\u2014the Association of South-East Asian Nations which promises to contribute substantially to the peace and stability of the region.\n152.\tThe exception to peace in South-East Asia is Indochina, where the merciless and needless destruction and suffering caused by the now undisguised aggression of North Viet-Nam continue to appall the world. We can only appeal to the leaders in the North to take stock of the terrible havoc this war has wrought. Realization is long overdue that serious negotiation does not signify weakness, that a negotiated settlement does not signify defeat and that it is not impossible for different ideologies eventually to coexist in peace and prosperity.\n153.\tMy Government fully supports the terms of the offer made by the President of the United States in May of this year as a practical basis for ending the military conflict, and we can only hope that that offer, or one like it, will ultimately prove to hold the key to real progress not only towards a cease-fire but also towards an agreed settlement that will bring an end to the miseries of the long-suffering people of South Viet-Nam and also of their neighbors in Laos and the Khmer Republic.\n154.\tAustralia had hoped that at this session of the General Assembly we should be able to welcome to the Organization as a new Member Bangladesh, with which Australia has especially friendly links. We believe that Bangladesh is fully qualified for membership in the United Nations. We remain hopeful that the Security Council, upon reconsideration of the matter, will recommend in favor of the Bangladesh application and that as a result the Assembly will still be able at its present session to admit this new State to the world body as a full Member.\n155.\tIn passing, may I compliment the Secretary-General on the impressive way in which his office has tackled the enormous problem of co-ordinating relief for Bangladesh. Independent reports from Dacca testify to the expedition and efficiency with which relief aid valued at more than $200 million has been made available to Bangladesh by the United Nations Relief Operation in Dacca since the end of last year.\n156.\tThe economic problems facing Bangladesh exemplify the need for greater assistance on more favorable terms to the developing world. Australia this year is committed to provide $US 260 million in international aid, an increase of 10 per cent over expenditure in the previous financial year. Together with private capital flows, the net transfer of resources to developing countries this year will account for an estimated 1.27 per cent of Australia's gross national product. Australia continues to be among the first three or four donor countries in the amount of official development assistance extended in relation to gross national product, and almost all Australian aid is given in the form of grants.\u2003\nAmong other increases, Australia will be raising its contribution to the United Nations Development Program this year by 20 per cent.\n157.\tBefore concluding, I should refer briefly to the financial position of the United Nations. We believe it remains a vital task for each of us to assist in finding a solution to the Organization's debt problem. We hope that real progress will be made when the question is taken up this year in the Fifth Committee.\n158.\tWe welcome the steps taken by the Secretary-General to restrain budgetary increases. Australia wants to see each year a budget adequate to support the expanding work- program of the Organization. But that does not mean that every new program or project, however well intentioned, is to be accepted regardless of its cost. The United Nations, like other institutions, has to establish its priorities in the knowledge that not every fresh activity can be accommodated in the budget at one and the same time.\n159. I have spoken about the role of the United Nations in maintaining a stable, harmonious world order, and about particular situations within and outside the immediate purview of the United Nations which closely affect my country. In all these situations there is a challenge to the United Nations, which means a challenge to all of us here. Let us hope we can accept that challenge.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your election to the presidency of our General Assembly is for us a source of profound joy. The honor it bestows upon your friendly country and on your own person is a just tribute to your high personal qualities and your competence.\n6.\tIn associating the delegation of Lebanon with the warm congratulations and good wishes that have been addressed to you, I wish to assure you of our full co-operation and to express our conviction that under your wise guidance our work will progress under the very best of circumstances.\n7.\tWe are also pleased to thank and pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, and to recall the wisdom, tactfulness and great skill with which he discharged the functions of the presidency of the last General Assembly session, in particularly delicate circumstances.\n8.\tThe agenda of the present session includes many important items to the consideration of which the delegation of Lebanon will lend its full co-operation. I shall at this time limit myself to mentioning two of them which are, for us as a developing country, of particular interest. These are disarmament and development.\n9.\tOne of the priority aims of our Organization is to achieve disarmament. The mad arms race of recent years and the terrible holocaust that threatens our universe must urge States all States forward to work by every possible means for the attainment of that noble objective. We recognize, to be sure, that some progress has been made and that some partial success has been achieved within the framework of our Organization or bilaterally. But much more will have to be done and our efforts to achieve the goals we seek must be increased.\n10.\tThat is why the delegation of Lebanon welcomes the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference within the framework of the United Nations. This conference will be called upon to contribute to dispelling the fears of an anxious mankind, to carry out progressively and by stages the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the destruction of these weapons and, finally, to arrive at the desired disarmament to ensure international security.\nA/PV.2041\n11.\tDisarmament cannot be disassociated from.the major problem confronting our planet: that of development. It is not by mere chance that the General Assembly has proclaimed the 1970s as both a disarmament and development decade. Incalculable resources are swallowed up every year for military purposes. A minute part of these resources, if devoted to action for development, would greatly contribute to solving the economic and social problems which are becoming increasingly acute because of under-development, would narrow the gap between the rich and the poor of the earth and would lessen the enormous disparities which still exist within national communities as well as between a small group of privileged countries and the vast majority of mankind.\n12.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J, which was inspired by the loftiest principles, has set important targets and defined the means to attain them. However, these principles and objectives must not remain pious hopes; and a political will, particularly on the part of the developed countries, and a feeling of human solidarity over and above selfish interests must contribute to implementing these objectives fully.\n13.\tThe disappointing results of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], which confirmed the' apprehensions that the previous conference had aroused, prove that this will and this feeling have not yet attained the necessary degree and intensity.\n14.\tOn another level, we are gratified at the positive results achieved at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The Declaration of the Conference, the environment funds and the appropriate institutional machinery will doubtless promote international cooperation for the preservation of the human environment. In this field as in others relating to development, the contribution of the advanced countries is of paramount importance and the needs and interests of the developing countries must be protected. Lebanon for its part will contribute within its means to the collective undertaking for the preservation of the environment.\n15.\tThe yearly sessions of the General Assembly provide us with an opportunity to assess the international political situation and to measure the progress accomplished in the attainment of the objectives of our Charter. This year we find indications both of new hope and continuing disenchantment.\n16.\tFirst of all, we see reason for hope because we have observed an atmosphere of detente and rapprochement which has continued to establish itself and develop throughout the past year and a slow but sure progress towards the peaceful political solution of a certain number of conflicts and crises which trouble our world.\n17.\tThe high-level contacts between the great Powers and the recourse to diplomacy and discussion certainly contribute to the maintenance of peace and encourage rapprochement and co-operation, thereby removing the specter of confrontation. The efforts made to accelerate the process of the political settlement of certain persistent conflicts also contribute to a relaxation of the international climate an.r to putting into effect within our Organization the principle of universality, which is so earnestly desired.\n18.\tHowever, we cannot help noticing that there is less interest in certain grave problems, in particular, the situation prevailing in the Middle East, which constantly threatens international peace and security. The interdependence of nations in our present world is such that it is quite obvious that no nation can remain indifferent to the crises which for many years have troubled that part of the world.\n19.\tI need not recall facts which are known to all. I simply wish to draw the attention of the General Assembly to two points which, as I see it, are of particular interest.\n20.\tThe first is that the Assembly, as well as other United Nations organs, such as the Security Council and the Commission on Human Rights, has already adopted clear- cut positions on the question of the Middle East in general and on some of its aspects in particular, for example on the status of Jerusalem, the treatment of the occupied populations and the Israeli attacks against Lebanon and other Arab countries.\n21.\tWhat I should like to say here and I shall never tire of repeating it-is that none of these decisions, and I stress \\\"none\\\", has been implemented by Israel.\n22.\tAmbassador Jarring's mission under Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has been deliberately and methodically sabotaged, like the decision itself. General Assembly resolution 2799 (XXVI), adopted at the last session, which, like Security Council resolution 242 (1967), was designed to seek a political solution to the conflict, has not even begun to be implemented.\n23.\tIn resolution 2253 (ES-V), which was adopted by an overwhelming majority on 4 July 1967 and confirmed by resolution 2254 (ES-V) of 14 July 1967, the General Assembly declared that the annexation of Jerusalem to the State of Israel was invalid and called on Israel \\\"to rescind all measures already taken and to desist forthwith from taking any action which would alter the. status of Jerusalem\\\". Other resolutions on the same lines have been adopted since 1967, confirming the above-mentioned resolutions. In spite of this, the process of Judaization is continuing implacably in the Holy City.\n24.\tThe populations of the occupied territories, which should have been protected by the Geneva Conventions and the general laws of war, are subjected by the occupier to a veritable regime of terror. Kept in a state of inferiority and subjection, their freedoms are violated and their property is plundered. The commissions of inquiry established by the United Nations have never been able to carry out the mission entrusted to them. The Israeli authorities have always refused them access to the territories which Israel controls.\n25.\tEven within the territories that since 1948 have been directly subjected to Israeli authority, the Arab populations have always been the subject of bullying and discrimination. The treatment applied to them is the most arbitrary which can be imagined. By way of example, the Christian inhabitants of the villages of Kefar Bar'am and Iqrit, who were removed by force from their homes in 1948, have not been able to return to their villages and land in spite of a decree in their favor, a decree which this time was issued not by the Security Council but by the Supreme Court of Israel itself. What has happened at Iqrit and Kefar Bar'am is but an example. It illustrates the procedures used by the Israeli authorities in hundreds of similar cases.\n26.\tIn another field which is of more direct concern to my country, how many times has the Security Council condemned Israel for the attacks committed by its armed forces against Lebanon? How many times has it called upon Israel to put an end to its aggression and threatened it with more effective measures if it did not change its attitude?\n27.\tAll these appeals, resolutions and injunctions have remained without effect, as have those which defined the foundations for political solutions, those intended to safeguard the real character of Jerusalem and protect the populations in the occupied territories, or those designed to put an end to aggression against neighbors. These resolutions, to quote Israel, are \\\"destined for the morgue of history\\\".\n28.\tNo further proof is needed e Israel does not intend to submit to any discipline or to implement any decision. Only the policy of force counts for Israel.\n29.\tI consider that this permanent challenge to the international community by a country which owes every- thing-even its very existence to the United Nations quite obviously raises a problem which should be considered and settled by the United Nations. The facts of the problem are clear, as I have just recalled. What is also clear are the elements of the solution. By this I mean the sanctions provided in Chapter VII of the Charter of our Organization.\n30.\tThe second point to which I should like to draw the attention of this Assembly is that the conflict in the Middle East is degenerating rapidly and becoming extremely dangerous. Acts of violence have become so frequent, so broad and so serious that they no longer threaten only the civilian populations, but even endanger international peace and security. Certain Palestinian elements on the one hand, and the regular Israeli forces on the other hand, are embarked on an infernal cycle of violence.\n31.\tIf measures were to be adopted to put an end to this state of affairs, it seems to us necessary, if they are to be effective, that they should be studied in an impartial spirit inspired by the two following requirements.\n32.\tFirst of all, the study must cover all the acts of violence. To circumscribe it to the acts committed by the Palestinians alone would be proof of partiality and injustice. One must not pretend to forget that it is the Zionists who inaugurated political terrorism and introduced it in the Near East. Today there is too great a tendency to wish to ignore the bloody exploits of the Haganah, Irgun, Stern and many other Zionist terrorist organizations. But how can one fail to remind all those who no doubt in order to clear their consciences are accusing the Palestinians of the assassination of Count Bernadotte, the United Nations mediator, or of the massacre of the inhabitants in the village of Deir Yassin, where the bodies of old people, women and children were thrown into a hole where they were discovered by the International Red Cross? How can we forget the attack on the King David Hotel in Jerusalem which killed men, women and children?\n33.\tWithout going too far into the past, which is nevertheless still in our minds, let us recall to those who today show so much anger and indignation about the taking of hostages and the massacre which followed -a massacre which took place under very confused circumstances that no one seems to be in a hurry to elucidate- that however horriMe the violence which took place in Munich, the attack committed only yesterday by the Israeli forces within the territory of Lebanon was no less odious and condemnable.\n34.\tOn 21 June 1972 Israeli forces penetrated into our territory, killing 3 Lebanese soldiers and kidnapping 6 Lebanese and Syrian officers to be used as hostages in order to obtain the liberation of Israeli prisoners held in Egypt and Syria. Those who committed this aggression were not uncontrolled and practically uncontrollable elements; they were not men who were driven to despair and who are alone responsible for their acts. They were soldiers of a regular army, acting on behalf of their Government and on the orders of their superiors. This act of State terrorism was applauded by the Israeli leaders and presented by them as a glorious exploit.\n35.\tOn the morrow of the Lod attack, of which Lebanon immediately disapproved and with which it was in no way associated, the Israeli air force on 21, 22 and 23 June unleashed an attack against the innocent civilian population of Hasbaya and Deir El-Achaer, killing and wounding men, women and children. The intention of Israel was to take revenge on the peaceful Lebanese villagers for the Puerto Rican and Israeli deaths which had taken place under the guns of foreign extremists who came to Israel from a foreign country. How can one fail to condemn this massacre of Lebanese civilians, dictated by an apparent logic of terror?\n36.\tOnly a few days ago, on 8 September, the same Israeli air force bombed three sites in the north and south of Lebanon. The \\\"glorious\\\" results of this heroic operation was that 9 children, one woman and 2 men were killed and 34 other civilians were wounded, including 16 children aged from 8 to 15 years.\n37.\tEven more recently, on 16 September an armored Israeli division, with air support, invaded the south of Lebanon under cover of \\\"suppressing\\\" the fedayeen. Actually, it destroyed or damaged 435 dwellings and two bridges, killed or wounded 143 military and civilian Lebanese, as well as approximately a score of Palestinian refugees, and itself suffered severe losses inflicted by the Lebanese army. I believe that the least that can be said about this typical new aggression is that it had resulted in a definite setback for Israel on the political level and on the military level.\n38.\tIs it the desire to take measures against terrorism? Such measures can be effective only if they are based on objectivity, not using two weights and two measures.\n39.\tSecondly, if there is really a desire to do away with acts of violence, one must attack honestly and courageously the real causes and discover means of eradicating them. It is not sufficient to consider certain episodic manifestations. In this connexion, certain truths should be said, and said without hedging the issue, even though they might disturb the moral and intellectual comfort of those people and circles who are complacently desirous of keeping a clear conscience and who themselves shoulder an awesome responsibility, either because they have persecuted the Jews, or because they have allowed the Jews to subject an innocent people to the atrocious treatment to which they themselves were subjected.\n40.\tThe creation of the State of Israel was accompanied by the mass exodus of the inhabitants of Palestine, provoked by threats, intimidation and terror. Today there is a new Diaspora of wandering Palestinians and displaced Arabs, who cannot and do not want to be assimilated in any other country.\n41.\tThese people, almost 2 million human beings, live in a state of growing despair, which explains certain passionate reactions and certain desperate acts. These people are convinced, quite rightly, that they are the victims of Zionist terror.\n42.\tDespite all the principles on which our civilization is based, never has this people been given the opportunity to be consulted as to its fate or to exercise its natural right to self-determination. True, the international community had decided 23 years ago that the Palestinians who were chased away could choose between returning to their homes or receiving just compensation [resolution 302 (IV)]. But for 23 years never has there been a beginning of the application of this decision because of the intransigence of Israel. Nor has the international community, in 23 years, ever decided to apply the decision which it itself had freely adopted. The Palestinians-and who can blame them? -feel themselves to be totally abandoned and betrayed.\n43.\tIf it is really desired to do away with the sources of violence, it is to this source that one must go in the first place. It will solve nothing to repress, it will avail nothing to punish, one group of persons or another or any given country which one considers -unjustly, furthermore- to be responsible for any given attempt. Violence has never suppressed violence. On the contrary, it rekindles and exacerbates it and gives it increased vigor, audacity and intensity.\n44.\tWhat does one expect, what can one expect from repression- that it will physically repress the elements of the Palestinian resistance? Suppose that this objective could be attained and that the world were to tolerate such genocide. Can one not foresee that the resistance of the Palestinian people will rise from the ashes and give it a vigor and aggressiveness which it has never known so far?\n45.\tZionist terrorism cannot suppress the entire Palestinian people. And as long as justice is not done and these legitimate aspirations are not satisfied, one must expect these feelings of despair and frustration to increase in intensity and seriousness.\n46.\tBefore I conclude, it is my duty to draw the attention of the Assembly most particularly to the aggressive attitude of Israel in regard to my country. Israel has constantly been committing aggression against Lebanon for four years, whereas the Armistice Agreement of 1949, which remains in force and was once again confirmed by the Security Council in its consensus of 19 April 1972,  categorically forbids Israel to do so. Israel first sought to justify these aggressions by alleging that there had been rocket fire from Lebanese territory directed against the territories under Israel's control.\n47.\tLebanon adopted certain measures to put an end to these allegations. Being short of arguments, Israel then claimed that Palestinian resistance fighters were undertaking acts of violence within the occupied territories and it deduced from this that they had infiltrated through the Lebanese frontier, Lebanon then requested of the Security Council, and obtained on 19 April 1972, an increase in the number of observers on its international frontier. The reports of these international observers presented to the Council prove not only that the allegations of Israel are unfounded, but further, that it is Israel itself which constantly violates the Lebanese frontier.\n48.\tAt the end of 1968, the Israeli commandos destroyed 13 Lebanese civil aircraft at the airport in Beirut, under the pretext that Palestinian commandos which had attacked an Israeli aircraft at Athens had passed through Lebanon in transit. Even more recently, after the Lod attack, the Israeli army organized a genuine massacre of the Lebanese civilian population under the pretext that the extremists had passed through Lebanon in transit. On the morrow of Munich three deadly raids were carried out against the Lebanese civilian population, and this time Israel felt no need to seek the slightest justification.\n49.\tNeed I say how fallacious these pretexts seem to us? That there are Palestinians in Lebanon and that they feel that they are the victims of Israel nobody denies; Israel knows it better than anyone, since it has forced them by terror to take refuge in Lebanon and is against their repatriation.\n50.\tMoreover, Palestinians are settled in a large number of countries, Arab and non-Arab. If Israel were to follow all their movements, suspect and implicate all the countries where they reside or through which they may have gone in transit, then it would be not only towards Lebanon but towards most of the countries of the world that it should launch its bomber squadrons.\n51.\tHow can one allow Israel to attack Lebanon, and Lebanon alone, persistently, whenever any action is undertaken against its interest or its nationals in any part of the world? If the intransigence of the leaders of Israel was the cause of the Munich massacre, by what confused logic can one blame Lebanon and hence justify the attacks on Lebanon and the massacre of women and children? Furthermore, the Federal Government of Germany itself officially declared that Lebanon could not in any way be held responsible.\n52.\tActually Israel is pursuing quite different objectives. If Lebanon is the target it is not to avenge Athens, nor Lod, nor Munich. I repeat, Lebanon-and Israel knows it -is in no way implicated in these affairs. What Israel is doing is seeking a pretext to destroy it. Lebanon in its present structure, where Jews, Christians and Moslems coexist freely, harmoniously and democratically, this Lebanon disturbs Israel because it is a categorical and living denial of Israel's racist concepts and policy of ostracism. Furthermore, Israel covets a part of our territory. It is an expansionist State by nature and by vocation and cannot be satisfied with fixed, immovable and recognized frontiers.\n53.\tAll the maps drawn up by the Zionist movement and the statements made by authoritative Israeli leaders confirm these objectives. Zionist propaganda, which has available to it means heretofore unknown in the history of the world, has succeeded in making international public opinion believe in the image of a peaceful and threatened Israel. The facts, particularly since 1967, categorically refute these assertions.\n54.\tToday, when the same propaganda claims that the security of Israel is threatened by Lebanon, and that to defend its security it is forced to carry out military actions against Lebanon, no one can any longer believe it.\n55.\tLebanon does not threaten Israel. It is Israel which threatens Israel. It threatens Lebanon in its harmonious, human structures; in its integrity and its independence.\n56= The international community, which has so often condemned Israel for its aggression against my country, knows this full well. In expressing my gratitude, as well as that of Lebanon, to this community, and especially to those friendly countries that have so often taken the initiative of giving support to the cause of Lebanon, in particular by demanding the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory, I appeal once again to the friendship and vigilance of those I have mentioned to prevent any new aggression.\n57. It is not the Israelis or the Palestinians or the allies of either of the parties directly engaged in the conflict that can put an end to that conflict and thereby to acts of violence. It is only the international community which is capable of taking that responsibility. For my part, I refuse to make a definite finding of failure or bankruptcy. The founders of our Organization wished it to be powerful, effective, and capable of ensuring the new international order to which mankind aspired after the ravages of the war - a new order based on law and justice, solidarity, peace and collective security. Towards that end they vested the Security Council - which bears the prime responsibility for the. task of maintaining that new. international order-with powerful means. The Charter also provides for adequate measures to deal with the persistent violation of its principles by a Member of the Organization.\n58.\tWe are increasingly convinced that it is necessary and urgent to restore the authority of the United Nations and its prestige, to enable our Organization, by the energetic application of the provisions of the Charter, fully to ensure its noble role in the interests of all Member States, all nations, large or small.\n59.\tLebanon is a small country, which believes in peace and justice. It firmly believes in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and finds in the respect of these principles and their development the principal guarantee for its security. Accordingly, Lebanon would fervently hope that the safeguarding and consolidation of the United Nations will unite the faith and the energies of all States and of all men.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me to congratulate you on your assumption of the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session. I wish you every success in steering the deliberations of this august Assembly.\n131.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, for the efficient manner in which he chaired the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly when discussions of far-reaching importance to this Organization were undertaken.\n132.\tIt is now nearly a year since the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, assumed his duties. At that time we expressed to him the best wishes of the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone [2031st meeting]. I wish to commend him for his achievements over the past nine months. Very soon after assuming office, the Secretary- General made historic visits to various parts of the world, including Africa. He met and exchanged views with heads of State and government and foreign ministers. We are confident that during his tenure of office he will raise aloft the high ideals of the United Nations.\n133.\tWe congratulate him in particular for having succeeded in persuading the racist regime of South Africa to permit an officer of the United Nations to enter Namibia in order to investigate in great detail the political situation in that Territory with the ultimate aim of granting it independence. My delegation takes this opportunity to thank him and his staff for the report they have submitted on this question. \n134.\tMay I take this opportunity to report that our new Republic, under the Presidency of His Excellency Mr. Siaka Stevens, has definitely brought progress, order and stability to Sierra Leone. We look forward to renewing our efforts to strive together with the international community for the further development of peace and progress on earth.\n135.\tLet me now highlight a number of matters which may be deliberated during this session of the General Assembly and which reflect certain aspects of Sierra Leone's foreign policy.\n136.\tMy Government stands firmly committed to the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ, which enters into its second decade next year. The OAU has developed into a strong institution, capable not only of harmonizing the views of different African States but also of solving the difficulties which may from time to time occur among its members.\n137.\tIn Africa we are plagued with different forms of imperialism which we can no longer tolerate. In the north of the continent we have for long endured the Middle East conflict. We had hoped that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) would be accepted by all parties as the basis for solving this particular conflict, but it seems that our hopes are not being fulfilled. In the south we witness the worst forms of inhumanity by man to man, an imperialism which seeks to enslave the soil of the African under the doctrine of white-skin racial superiority. The various resolutions of this Assembly condemning apartheid and racial discrimination have failed to have any effect on the racist regimes. In scattered pockets of the continent, colonialist Powers like Portugal continue to impose the yoke of colonialism and imperialist domination on peace-loving Africans in continued defiance of resolution 1514 (XV) and other resolutions of this body. Even those African States which have won their independence the hard way now face a new form of neo-imperialism. Certain big Powers not only directly interfere in their internal affairs, but even stir up internal subversion and mercenary activity in order to topple progressive African Governments not to their liking.\n138.\tAfrica is the continent now zealously trying to evolve new and practical democratic patterns, utilizing some of the norms handed over by the erstwhile colonial masters, while at the same time inventing and applying political institutions which would project the African personality. My delegation implores the various Governments assailing the Independence of Africa to let us alone and give us a chance to make our own contribution to the cause of international peace.\n139. The Middle East conflict seems to be oscillating between hope and despair. Towards the beginning of the year there was hope that an end to the conflict was in sight. As we meet during this session, those hopes seem to be receding into the distance. We have had problems of the kidnapping of personnel in Syria and southern Lebanon by Israel, and we join those who demand the unconditional repatriation of such kidnapped personnel. While these problems remain unsettled, we have been shocked at the recent killing of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games. Before reason could prevail, we witnessed military invasions against Lebanon, letter-bombs being sent to Israelis in different parts of the world, and a threat of the renewal of the conflict. My Government has developed friendly relations both with the Arab nations and with Israel, and it pains us to witness such carnage inflicted from time to time by either party.\n140.. We have always been strong supporters of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). In a joint communique issued by my President, Mr. Siaka Stevens, and Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia in January this year, an appeal was made to the parties concerned to facilitate a peaceful settlement based on that resolution. My delegation fervently hopes that Mr. Jarring will be given the opportunity to solve this problem. Israel, in particular, should understand that it is in its own interest for the work of the Jarring mission to continue to a fruitful and successful conclusion.\n141*. My delegation continues to propose, in addition to the Jarring mission, the convening of a peace conference on the Middle East conflict that would bring together all the partier concerned and recommend general guidelines based on the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The presence of the permanent members of the Security Council at such a peace conference would go a long way to justify the views of those who have been calling upon the permanent members not only to take effective steps within the United Nations framework to resolve the Middle East conflict but also to give their full support to Mr. Jarring.\n142.\tThe permanent members of the Security Council owe it to the international community not to get directly involved in the Middle East conflict, even by the supply of arms; rather they should ensure the early withdrawal of Israeli armed forces now occupying Arab territories and enforce guarantees by both Israel and the Arab nations that neither will attack the other.\n143.\tOnce again it is the bounden duty of my delegation to reaffirm my Government's stand condemning the apartheid policies of the racist regimes in southern Africa.\n144.\tThe African States have tried to frame principles of peaceful coexistence in the Manifesto on Southern Africa. However, we all know that the colonialist and racist Powers have completely rejected the principles of the Manifesto, thereby making it quite clear that the subjected African people are left with no alternative but to intensify their armed struggle for the liberation of their fatherlands and the enjoyment of human dignity. In the face of the adamant opposition of the colonialist and racist Powers to peaceful change, my delegation is convinced that there is a need not only to recognize but also to assist the legitimate armed struggle of the liberation movements in southern Africa. We would emphasize the importance of working out specific programs at the international level for providing materials of practical use, and other forms of political solidarity, in such a way as to make a decisive contribution to the eradication of colonialism and racism in southern Africa.\n145.\tMy delegation is fully prepared to support any action considered expedient to meet the South African menace. My country has already imposed the most severe restrictions on trade with South Africa and, in compliance with the decision taken by the OAU, my Government is committed to a policy of isolation, no-dialog, and the imposition of sanctions on the regime in South Africa.\n146.\tWe shall do all in our power to ensure that the millions of black indigenous Africans of South Africa are treated with equality and human dignity, which is their rightful heritage.\n147.\tMy delegation is deeply concerned that no effective steps have yet been taken to stop Portugal from conducting in Africa a war of liquidation, armed with the most modern military equipment, which it has undoubtedly acquired from its NATO friends. Indeed, we note with amazement that people who are loud in their condemnation of lapses in others are themselves so often guilty of the worst manifestations of double standards. Once again we call on those NATO Powers, without whose help Portugal really would be shown up in its real impotence, to desist from continuing their military and tacit support and to exert all the pressure of which they are capable to persuade their Portuguese friends not only to end brutalities against innocent victims in Guinea (Bissau), Cabinda, Mozambique and Angola but also to practice that humanitarianism which is such a cherished virtue of the NATO Powers.\n148.\tThe situation in Southern Rhodesia remains precarious. The people of Zimbabwe have overwhelmingly rejected the proposals for a settlement  between the United Kingdom Government and the illegal regime of Ian Smith, and it is gratifying to note that the United Kingdom Government has accepted the Pearce Commission report. My delegation warmly welcomes that independent report, which truly reflects the political maturity and courage of the people of Zimbabwe.\n149.\tMy delegation is of the view that the United Kingdom Government should now be more positive in its action and attitude towards Ian Smith and his clique, who have recently defied world opinion by restricting the movements of African nationalist leaders in Zimbabwe and continuing their suppression of the people of Zimbabwe. The Government of Sierra Leone calls on the international community to do its utmost to ensure that independence is mot granted to Southern Rhodesia before majority rule.\n150.\tIt is my delegation's view that a national convention of all groups in Zimbabwe should now be summoned in order to decide the form of constitution on the basis of which that country should proceed to independence, and that all nationalist leaders detained should be released immediately so that they could participate in any discussion on the constitutional future of their country. The United Kingdom Government should assume the responsibility for summoning such a national convention, which should be afforded facilities freely and frankly to deliberate the burning issues involved and arrive at just solutions or acceptable compromises. Another independent commission, or even the Pearce Commission, could be entrusted with the task of arranging and servicing such a national convention.\n151.\tThe question of Namibia continues to receive our constant attention. We note with grave concern that South Africa is at present using Namibia as a base for violating the territories of neighboring independent African States.\n152.\tI have already reiterated my delegation's commendation of the efforts being made by the Secretary-General as regards the Namibian problem and our hopes that the recent appointment of his personal representative will speedily bring to a successful conclusion the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the rights and interests of the people of Namibia and to lead them without delay to independence.\n153.\tMy delegation must, however, express concern that the fate of the people of Namibia seems to be deliberately entrusted to the whims and caprices of the racist regime of South Africa. My Government has constantly opposed any form of dialog with that racist regime. However, in the interest of the rapid political advancement of the Namibian people, and notwithstanding the 1971 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  declaring the continued presence of the South African Administration in the Territory to be illegal, my Government did not oppose the holding of talks between the Secretary-General and the leaders of the racist regime. It now appears that progress is being stultified by the intransigence of the racist regime, which is putting all sorts of difficulties and obstacles in the way. My Government wants to stress that a clear and unequivocal commitment should be made by South Africa as regards the unimpeded attainment of independence by Namibia. My delegation would also stress that in our view the sole aim of the Secretary-General and his representative in their dealings with the South African regime should be to bring about the independence of Namibia as a free and independent sovereign State.\n154.\tMy delegation is at a loss to understand with what justification certain great Powers continue to impose a yoke of servitude on a number of faraway countries with which they have no ethnic connexion. Those colonial Powers argue that territorial servitude must continue, either because the countries affected are too small to become economic or politically viable units or because they are culturally undeveloped or even because the inhabitants, after so-called referendums, prefer the status of colonial servitude. International co-operation on earth has now developed to the point where no nation, however small, however poor, is unable to govern itself; and no nation, however affluent or prosperous, is satisfied with being ruled by another. My delegation therefore once again appeals to all Powers having colonies, or what look like colonies, in Africa, in Asia, in America and in Oceania to take immediate steps to grant those subjected peoples a free and full measure of independence. If they really like you, they will thereupon enter into all sorts of bilateral treaties with you, and you can continue to help them. The international community would then be satisfied that your new relationship is not one of colonial master and subjected servant, but an association of free and independent States. Refusal by the colonialist Powers to grant their charges independence can only leave a sour taste in one's mouth and unsavory conclusions about disguised economic and political exploitation.\n155.\tMy delegation continues to be concerned with the situation in VietNam and condemns most vehemently the indiscriminate bombing of North VietNam which has been causing so much suffering, deprivation and hardship to the heroic VietNamese people. We still believe that lasting peace can be achieved in VietNam only when the political realities of the situation are taken into account.\n156.\tWe therefore urge that serious negotiations for a settlement at the Paris talks should not only respect the inalienable right of the entire people of Viet-Nam, North and South, to effective self-determination and true independence without outside interference by any nation, large or small, but should also create the facilities for the two opposing political forces to come together and solve their internal problems and differences on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual non-elimination.\n157.\tMy delegation is convinced that peace can come to the countries in IndoChina only if all foreign forces are removed from the area and the IndoChinese peoples are allowed to work out a settlement with no outside or foreign interference. We therefore join those who call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that area.\n158.\tMy delegation is disturbed by the fact that, in the process of the withdrawal of United States military personnel and other combatant troops from South Viet-Nam, the conflict continues to be extended to Laos and Cambodia by intensive bombing and fighting, resulting in irreparable loss of life and property in those countries. The peoples of those countries must be left in peace, without any outside interference, to settle their differences and problems. \n159.\tAs far as the problem of Korea is concerned, I should like to make it clear that my Government has developed very friendly ties with both North Korea and South Korea. We have impressed on those two States the fact that they must realize that they are brothers.\n160.\tMy delegation continues to support the peaceful reunification of Korea without any outside interference. We feel that it is high time that the rights of the heroic people of Korea were recognized so that they can harmonize their differences and take their legitimate seat in the councils of the nations. We are indeed hopeful that the process of peaceful reunification will gain momentum within the shortest possible period of time.\n161.\tMy delegation is extremely happy at the result of the recent summit conference between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India and President Bhutto of Pakistan and we hope that these talks will continue with fruitful results for India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and with a happy solution to the problem of repatriation of prisoners of war and a lasting peace in the Indian subcontinent. We trust that the many points of the Simla Agreement will be honored by all parties, and that Bangladesh will soon take its rightful place in the comity of nations.\n162.\tGermany is in more or less the same position as Korea, and the German peoples have for more than a quarter of a century remained apart. My delegation welcomes the talks which have been taking place between the two German States. Last year I expressed the hope from this podium [1949th meeting] that the evident entente in East-West relations would result in removing all obstacles in the way of the people of Germany being represented in this world Assembly.\n163.\tMy delegation is deeply concerned at the fact that a great nation like Germany is still outside the United Nations. We are convinced that the time is ripe for Germany to play its part on the international scene. While we would not like the General Assembly to enter into discussions which might tend to magnify the differences between the two brother States, we would appeal to this session of the General Assembly to look at the German problem constructively in order to bring about a solution to the question of the admission of Germany into this world body. If the two parts of the same country still prefer to go their separate ways, we should respect their inclinations and facilitate their entry as two brother States. Twin States may soon recognize that it is better for them to become unitary than to remain divergent. The decision however should be theirs and not ours.\n164.\tThe past year has been truly called the year of international detente. We have witnessed a general rapprochement in international relations. The super-Powers have realized that there is little to gain by open confrontation and much to profit from in. a policy of friendship. My delegation welcomes this diplomatic thaw.\n165.\tIn particular, we must congratulate the Secretary- General for emphasizing this international detente in the introduction he prepared to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l]. The Secretary-General has made a realistic assessment of present trends in inter-national relations and the Sierra Leone delegation endorses that realistic assessment. In this, his first introduction to an annual report, we can mark his long experience in diplomacy and his keen insight into present-day power realities in the world. My delegation agrees with the Secretary - General that the current detente among the great Powers is a historic development of the highest importance. The Secretary-General has, however, reminded us that we should not be too euphoric about this development since previous post-war indications of detente failed to materialize into a durable relaxation of international tensions. However, my delegation is happy that the super-Powers are coming together and are giving every indication that they realize that it is better to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks. My delegation welcomes this evident policy of the great Powers to confront each other without warlike belligerency, the tendency to minimize the military aspects of power in great-Power relationships, and the evident emergence of an era of negotiation, an era of dialog and contact among the bigger brothers of the international community.\n166.\tMy delegation also supports the thesis of the Secretary-General that the very fact of this international thaw calls for stronger vigilance and, we would stress, vigilance on the part of the nations of the third world, The super-Powers have embarked on a policy of detente because, among other reasons, they feel that the third world is becoming important. It is apparent, for example, that the third world, commanding a majority in the United Nations General Assembly, can adopt resolutions which, to say the least, might prove embarrassing to the super-Powers if they continued in open confrontation one against the other.\n167.\tThe tendency unfortunately seems to be for great Power ddtente to lead to great-Power recognition of exclusive spheres of great Power influence in various areas of international relations. The great Powers are coming to realize that with the growing democratization of the United Nations system they will not be getting their own way, particularly in the United Nations General Assembly, They are therefore devising a system of arrogating to themselves the responsibility for deciding the major issues of the world outside the United Nations, and many of those issues fundamentally touch the life and the very existence of the countries of the third world.\n168.\tMy delegation wishes to stress that this tendency is not in the interest of the United Nations in general nor of the developing countries in particular. The latter are now being sacrificed as pawns in super-Power politics. It is for that reason that my delegation whole-heartedly supports the call of the Secretary-General for all and sundry to realize that the super-Powers ought to accept the fact that the United Nations, their own creation, should be the central institution for harmonizing international action. We ought jealously to guard against the great Powers taking important problems away from the United Nations system to solve them in accordance with their own desires and inclinations. \n169.\tThe Secretary-General has warned that twice in this century world wars have resulted from the shortcomings of the old diplomacy in regulating the relations of the international community within the ambit of the policies of the powerful States [see A/870.1/Add. 1, p. 2]. The League of Nations was born because the members then genuinely felt that some order must be brought into the chaotic relationships of the international community. The League of Nations came to an end because, inter alia, the great Powers decided to solve the important and basic problems outside the League system.\n170.\tThe United Nations was conceived 27 years ago to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We must be careful that the United Nations does not suffer the fate of the League, because the super-Powers want to make themselves the rulers of the United Nations by solving world problems without reference to this Organization. The problems facing the Middle East, those facing Southern Rhodesia, those facing Namibia, those facing Korea, those facing the IndoChina peninsula, those facing the world monetary system, those facing world trade, are all of great concern to the international community and should be solved with the genuine co-operation of all the members of the international community. The tendency, however, is for certain great Powers to insist that those problems should be solved by reference to them and them alone. That tendency must be resisted.\n171.\tIt is not only the great Powers which are prone to weaken the structure and efficacy of the United Nations by taking the solution of problems outside this Organization. Certain smaller States are equally guilty. The Secretary- General in his introduction has drawn attention to the fast that measures to reach solutions in countries such as Koraa, India and Pakistan, and Germany are being taken outside the United Nations. While my delegation welcomes the efforts of smaller countries and countries which cannot be regarded as super-Powers to reach amicable solutions of their domestic or regional problems, nevertheless we would beg that the United Nations be brought more and more closely into the negotiation of such solutions. The Secretary-General has aptly advised that\n\\\"The United Nations provides, or should provide, the means by which all nations, great and small, participate on a basis of sovereign equality in the political process of establishing and maintaining international peace and security, in facing common problems through co-operation, and in planning and organizing for a better future.\\\" [A/8701/Add. 1, p. 2.J [A/8701/Add. 1, p. 2.}\nIf the United Nations is to fulfill that role, then we, its Members, should realize that some changes ought to be made in its structure.\n172.\tThe United Nations was conceived when the circumstances prevailing in the world were totally different from what they are now. My delegation believes that the Charter of the United Nations ought to be reviewed and improved to take account of the changed conditions and in particular to ensure that the Organization is not impotent when effective action is required. It is necessary to strive hard for changes in the Charter to give more regulatory powers to the General Assembly, to expand the membership of the\nSecurity Council, to review its functions and efficacy and to amend the veto powers to take account of the views of the third world, generally known as the developing countries.\n173.\tThe United Nations, despite its shortcomings, remains, if properly utilized, an effective institution for maintaining international peace and harmonizing inter-national relationships. It has been correctly stated that if the early fathers had not founded the United Nations after the Second World War necessity would have dictated that the institution, be established within 10 years after that event. We should not now allow the detente prevailing among the super-Powers to kill the United Nations or even to frustrate the attainment of its lofty ideals.\n174.\tIn spite of the apparent relaxation of tension among the super-Powers and a clearly noticeable improvement in the political atmosphere in Europe, there is nevertheless increasing competition among the same super-Powers in. certain other regions, and especially in the seas and oceans. It is therefore absolutely necessary for the United Nations to do all in its power to promote a better climate so far as the call for world disarmament is concerned.\n175.\tLast year my delegation endorsed the proposal for a world disarmament conference at the level of the United Nations. We then pointed out that a nuclear holocaust would affect not only the super-Powers but also all the other nations of the world. We therefore advocated that the superpowers should recognize that the peace-loving nations of the earth had an equally potent interest in disarmament and peace research.\n176.\tIn this connexion my delegation welcomes the agreements signed in Moscow by the United States and the Soviet Union during President Nixon's visit in May of this year. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks symbolize the existing nuclear parity between the two super-States. We believe that it is a hopeful sign that the super-Powers, possessors of such awesome weapons, now recognize the futility of continuing the nuclear arms race. My delegation expresses the hope that the super-Powers will now turn their attention towards devising a more comprehensive agreement on limiting offensive and defensive nuclear weapons, bearing in mind the necessity for a newer definition of the term \\\"aggression\\\". Indeed my delegation is of the opinion that at this session of the United Nations General Assembly representatives should continue the debate on the meaning of the term \\\"aggression\\\".\n177.\tAt the moment disarmament matters are being discussed in two separate forums. There is, first, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which meets regularly in Geneva. There are also the bilateral arms negotiations taking place, between the United States and the Soviet Union. My delegation recognizes the value of the existing machinery for disarmament negotiations. We must repeat, however, that if these are to be successful all the nations of the world ought to be involved. We therefore stress the necessity for examing all disarmament questions on a broad basis in a world disarmament conference at which it will be possible for all States to express their views. It must be recognized, however, that such a conference need not prejudice the usefulness of the existing machinery for disarmament negotiations. This strategy becomes imperative since, in spite of all the talks taking place, in spite of all the background negotiations, in spite of all the treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)], which have been signed, nuclear tests continue. The opportunity for the world to come together in a world disarmament conference should engender hopes for complete disarmament even if that would take some time to achieve.\n178.\tThe issue of international terrorism should be the concern of the entire international community. The incidents of hijacking of domestic airlines and armed attacks against innocent passengers should be the concern of all of us. It is no excuse that these savage acts may be directed against particular countries or peoples; as long as they involve attacks on commercial airlines and international gatherings such as the last Olympic Games in Munich they are in fact a danger to all mankind. International terrorism has degenerated into criminal kidnapping of ambassadors and top executives and even innocent school-children. Heaven only knows where it will end if concerted action is not taken to deal with this scourge. The entire international community must join in eradicating it.\n179.\tIt is unfortunate that certain Western countries are creating the impression that African States, among others, are opposed to the inclusion of this item on the agenda [item 92]. No truly responsible country could oppose the inclusion of such an important item, which concerns the safety of all of us.\n180.\tHowever, any resolution on this subject which would tend to interfere with the genuine liberation movements in colonial territories or expose them to armed attacks by the racist regimes of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and Portugal will be strongly opposed by my delegation, for the right to self-determination for all the colonial peoples of the world is one of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and for its attainment the liberation movements are a necessity. In this connexion, it is imperative that the term \\\"terrorism\\\" be clearly defined before the matter is debated.\n181.\tThe problems which attend great-Power detente are not political only: there are also economic problems, as can be seen from the results of the third session of UNCTAD. My Government continues to be greatly disturbed at the existing wide gulf between the developed and the developing nations and UNCTAD's failure at that session to arrive at effective measures to narrow that gap. We firmly believe that the developed nations must be willing to help the developing nations in their just struggle for economic independence and social advancement.\n182.\tAs far as the Government of Sierra Leone is concerned, the results of the third session of UNCTAD were most disappointing. Many resolutions adopted in Santiago were not commensurate with the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] or with resolutions adopted at earlier sessions of UNCTAD or of the United Nations. More than half of the resolutions adopted at the third session were not supported by the Governments of developed countries, which therefore could not be expected to implement them. The impression left was that the Governments of the developed countries wanted to replace the multinational framework of negotiations by bilateral relations with developing countries- bilateral relations which the world still condemns in the existing system of international trade and developmental aid.\n183.\tMy Government prefers the multinational approach to the solution of international trade and other inequalities rather than the bilateral approach. We are sovereign States even if we may be classed as poor, developing States. It is in our view necessary to make development aid become, not a weapon of division, but an instrument for real development, an instrument for co-operation and integration not only among the countries of any particular region but also among recipients and donors as a group rather than as individual States.\n184.\tMy Government will therefore continue to play its proper role in the task of UNCTAD particularly in reducing the trade gap between the developing and the developed countries. My delegation would favor a review of the shortcomings and failures of the third session of UNCTAD, particularly in so far as developing countries are concerned, so that we can all co-operate to make the fourth session of UNCTAD a real success. My Government calls for cooperation between the developing countries and the developed countries. We strongly believe that the developed nations must be willing to help the developing nations in their just struggle for economic independence.\n185.\tSierra Leone, for example, continues to import brushes to keep our tables and floors clean when we produce the timber that provides the handles for the brushes, the piassava that provides the bristles and the iron ore which provides the steel clips to fix the piassava to the wood. We are not alone in such experiences and, to make matters worse, efforts have been made and still are being made in some developed countries to replace natural products by synthetic substitutes. My delegation pleads with the developed countries to take all appropriate measures to discourage production of synthetics and substitutes, particularly those competing directly with the natural products of the developing nations.\n186.\tI have already pointed out that great-Power detente might lead to many economic problems for us, the developing countries. We must realize that new forms of co-operation among the super-Powers might lead to greater economic exploitation of our natural, God-given resources. When only one great Power was exploiting a particular country, and another great Power was, so to speak, fighting the former, developing countries were kept poor. Now that the great Powers are resolving some of the differences among them and can therefore harmonize their efforts.in exploiting developing countries, the future is indeed bleak.\n187.\tThis calls for very serious and quick thinking on the part of the entire international community. If politically developing countries have been achieving their objectives, we ought not to fail economically. A number of developing countries still have a few reserves of natural resources left which they can exploit. It is necessary for the international community to ensure the proper and orderly exploitation of these natural resources in the interest of the inter \nnational community in general and of the specific areas or regions in particular.\n188.\tOne such store of natural resources is in our territorial seas. My delegation therefore whole-heartedly welcomes the idea of holding a conference on the law of the sea in 1973, in accordance with a decision taken during the twenty-fifth session of this Assembly [resolution 2750 (XXV)]. As a coastal State, Sierra Leone attaches paramount importance to that conference for our economic development. In 1970 Sierra Leone proclaimed an extension of its territorial waters to 200 nautical miles. In so doing, we gave full consideration to the safeguarding of innocent passage for international commerce and scientific research geared towards the peaceful exploitation of the sea-bed.\n189.\tOur sea resources in many cases represent the potential economic means we have left for our economic development. Ocean technology now enables considerable exploitation, which can take place as far as the 200 nautical-mile limit. My Government agrees with those who insist that adjacent marine resources should be used for the benefit of coastal and neighboring land-locked States, and that far-away nations should not come to depredate such marine stocks any more.\n190.\tBefore I conclude, I should like briefly to mention a matter which touches the continued existence of the United Nations.\n191.\tCertain countries have recently complained that the United Nations scale of contributions should be revised and that their own percentages should be reduced. My delegation wishes to stress that the scale of contributions does take into account the principle of equality. If an equation were devised to show the relative per capita incomes in the Member States, such an equation would more or less correlate with the percentages in the United Nations scale of assessments. My delegation therefore does not support any policy of reducing individual assessments within the entire scale.\n192.\tHowever, we should take cognizance of the fact that a number of new nations have been admitted into the Organization. These new nations must of course support the United Nations in accordance with the formula which has been devised. Care should be taken not to over finance the Organization, or reduce the over-all budget. Granted the optimum budget for any period, the burden of financing should be worked cut and shared among the various\nMembers. This may of course result in the reduction Of any individual Member's contribution in any particular year.\n193.\tMy delegation would, however, warn that no action should be taken which would reduce the over-all budget of the Organization. Any such reduction would result in a lowering of standards as regards the caliber of staff being recruited, in a reduction of technical assistance to the developing countries and in the general ineffectiveness of the Organization. We therefore appeal to those who want a reduction not to shut their eyes to the dangers which might ensue from such a course.\n194.\tWe look forward to the great occasion of celebrating 1973 as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My delegation has read with interest the report introduced in the Third Committee by the Director of the Division of Human Rights [A [8820] and we congratulate the Division on the steps taken to secure the effective recognition of these rights particularly as they concern racism and racial discrimination. My delegation pleads that the axe of economy should not prejudice the work of the Division of Human Rights. The Director has outlined areas in which the effectiveness of human rights can be intensified. We should particularly emphasize the efforts being made to eliminate racism and racial discrimination, and we entertain the hope that the twenty-fifth anniversary will usher in an era of intensive and concerted action in this field and in the enhancement of the principle of self-determination.\n195.\tWe must not forget the un-ostentatious but nevertheless important work being performed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, particularly during this year in which momentous numbers of refugees had to be reinstated within a short period of time in the Indian subcontinent.\n196.\tFinally, in concluding this statement I wish to reaffirm my country's unflinching confidence m the United Nations as the only saving grace for mankind in this age of distrust, of economic exploitation and of great-Power rivalry. We in Sierra Leone believe that only the United Nations will ensure justice and economic and social progress for the oppressed peoples of the world. We will therefore continue to give our utmost support materially and otherwise towards the progress and advancement of our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to join my colleagues--the 115 of them who have spoken so far-in congratulating you on your election to the presidency. Under your guidance the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly has been carrying out its work-and will, I am sure, continue to carry it out with seriousness and the utmost efficiency. Allow me also from this rostrum to convey our warmest greetings to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, and once again to welcome our Secretary-General. It is less than a year since the then Ambassador Kurt Waldheim in this very hall took the solemn oath pledging loyalty to the Charter of the United Nations [2031st meeting]. I again wish him success. We again pledge to co-operate with him whole-heartedly, as we did with his well-remembered and respected predecessor, U Thant.\n98.\tThis annual general debate in our Assembly is, or should be, a time for a serious survey of the international actions of all Member States during the preceding year. As sovereign States, we have committed ourselves to the United Nations Charter and in doing so have willingly agreed to yield a portion of our sovereignty in order to set up this community of nations. We believe that, while each one of the Foreign Ministers is responsible before the proper organs of his country for the conduct of its foreign policy, he is also answerable to this Organization. This annual general debate should show that all Member countries have seriously tried to live by the Charter and have not violated its principles and purposes.\n99.\tThe primary purpose of the United Nations, to use the Charter's words, is:\n\\\"To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace.\\\"\t\nThe Charter, furthermore, stipulates that Member States should unite their efforts in order to fulfill that primary purpose. Collective action, according to the Charter, is the main guarantee of international justice and peace. SuperPowers may not need such protection. The rest of us do. Some States have found themselves in need of it in the past; some have cause to seek it now; others may well need it in the future. To block this collective action and to flout the authority of the Organization is to direct a most serious blow against all of us. Do we have to be reminded of this basic and obvious principle?\n100.\tThe facts show, however, that our collective search for justice and peace is often sabotaged and frustrated. Important resolutions in this Assembly and other United Nations bodies are ignored. The effectiveness of the Organization itself is scoffed at and doubted. Our Organization seems at certain times to be surrendering to the rule of force in relations between nations. Indeed the principles and purposes of the Charter, the raison d'etre of our Organization, unfortunately now need to be reasserted. The Organization must seriously and urgently consider how to regain its authority and its effectiveness.\n101.\tAttempts to depoliticize the United Nations have been detected for some time, especially since the ranks of the third-world countries have been further strengthened by the emancipation of our sister African and Asian States and their admission to the Organization as full Members. Some of .the more powerful States have shown their impatience and displeasure with certain of the political decisions and resolutions adopted by the United Nations. The view has been expressed that the United Nations should deal only with less ambitious matters. The Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries, meeting in Georgetown in August of this year, recognized that \\\"an impediment in the way of the effectiveness of the United Nations is great power tendency to ... bypass the United Nations in dealing with problems of vital importance\\\" and declared that \\\"this tendency must be resisted\\\". \n102.\tReferring to the seating last year of the lawful representatives of the great Republic of China, Mr. Waldheim, the Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report to the Assembly observed:\n\\\"Indeed, it is strange that, at a time when the United Nations and its main executive organ for international peace and security-the Security Council-are becoming more representative of the power realities in the world, there is, apparently, a certain unwillingness to involve the United Nations in the reconciliation of some conflicts. ... But when long-standing conflicts create vast humanitarian problems and may affect the peace and security of all mankind, the United Nations should surely be involved in the attempt to settle them.\\\" [A/8701/ Add.l, p. 4.]\n103.\tThe tendency by certain States to ignore the United Nations is clear. For us, to disregard such a tendency is to condone it and to endanger further the useful existence of oar Organization. All countries which wish to set their policies inside the shelter of the law of nations, our Charier, should pause and give this most serious problem the most careful consideration it commands.\n104.\tTo begin with, we must admit that our Organization itself has failed at times to assert its political authority. It is a fact, for example, that the Assembly has been reluctant to consider Article 6 of the Charter, dealing with the expulsion of a Member; it is a fact that the sanctions provided for in the Charter have seldom been imposed; it is a fact that certain permanent members of the Security Council have used or misused their veto power to block just and important resolutions and have thus frustrated the work of the Council; it is a fact that the United Nations had not yet overcome the serious difficulties that have prevented the creation of the enforcement machinery envisaged in Chapter VII of our Charter. The five permanent members of the Security Council, which, under the Articles of the Charter, have been given certain responsibilities for maintaining international peace and security, have not so far been able to agree on the creation of this machinery.\n105.\tOver the last 12 months, since we last met here, the world has witnessed changes on the international scene. The summit meetings involving the three most powerful nations have commanded the attention, and perhaps raised the hopes, of all the countries of the world. Almost all the speakers at this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly have alluded to a new atmosphere of international detente. It is obvious that the obstacles that have blocked the effectiveness of the United Nations-for example, with regard to implementing Chapter VII and giving the Organization the necessary machinery to do so-have been caused by the tensions among the big Powers, the permanent members of the Security Council. Now that major practical steps have been taken that should lead towards an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, should we in this Assembly not seize this opportunity seriously and honestly examine the situation of our Organization? Should we not endeavor to find suitable and agreed upon remedies for its very serious ailments? This study would focus on means to make the United Nations stronger, strong enough to protect us all. It is time to do so. It is time that we, collectively, exert all our efforts to stop the deterioration and possible collapse of our world order and of this great structure for peace. Our silence and inaction are an encouragement to the dangerous tendencies to resort to the policy of violence, the policy that \\\"twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\". It is a crime by omission. The restoration to this Organization of its political effectiveness and its role in preserving world peace obviously needs the full co-operation of the big Powers. Those Powers, however, shall not be indifferent to the will of the world as only we can manifest it.\n106.\tOur Charter may be humanly imperfect, yet it does not need basic revisions in order to achieve this purpose. It is we, the Members of the Organization, who need to live up to its objectives. Should we fail to do so, we may be witnessing the beginning of the end, the horrible, tragic crumbling of this Organization.\n107.\tIn his speech before this Assembly in this general debate the Foreign Minister of Israel criticized the techniques, procedures and atmosphere of this Organization as framing \\\"clearly not been congenial to the craftsmanship of peace\\\" (2045th meeting, para. 68]. The Assembly was told that all the \\\"successes of diplomacy in the past year... had to take place outside the United Nations framework.\\\" [Ibid., para. 67].\n108.\tWhat are these \\\"real limits\\\" that the Foreign Minister of Israel wishes to place on the capacity and strength of the United Nations, mankind's highest achievement? They are a bold attempt to strip this Organization of its most fundamental mandate, of its role in safeguarding peace and security and of its duty to bring them into being \\\"in conformity with the principles of justice and international law\\\", as the Charter-says. According to his thesis the United Nations, set up to ensure that war and injustice would be no more, does not have it in its capacity to deal with such issues. In his concluding paragraph the Israeli Minister suggested that were the United Nations to temper ambition with restraint it might perhaps be able to play an enlarged humanitarian role. I remember our colleague Ambassador Castro, saying that we would then be a branch of the Red Cross.\n109.\tThe simple, regrettable fact is that political Zionism, having used this Organization to realize its ambition of partitioning Palestine, cannot now suffer the nations of the world looking over its shoulder and trying to arrest its preconceived and preplanned expansionism.\n110.\tInstead of charting a mere humanitarian role for the United Nations, the Foreign Minister of Israel was certainly expected to tell this Assembly, to which he is answerable, what his country has or has not done with regard to resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly especially with regard to Assembly resolution 2799 (XXVI), which clearly called on his Government to respond favorably to the principles of peace advanced in February 1971 by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Gunnar Jarring.\n111.\tThat, as we all recall, was done in conformity with the mandate unanimously given to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General by the Security Council in its resolution 242 (1967) and later supported by this Assembly [resolution 2628 (XXV)].\n112.\tBut not once did the Foreign Minister of Israel mention those resolutions. Not once did he mention any resolution adopted by the General Assembly or the Security Council concerning the Middle East-not on the question of the Palestinians; not on Jerusalem; not on the occupied lands of Egypt, Syria and Jordan; not on the' barbaric attacks against Syria and Lebanon; not on the mistreatment of the population under the military rule of his Government-not once. He has, however, obliquely warned us in Egypt, in the Arab world and in the United Nations not to entertain any hope that Israel will ever be subjected to any adjudication or coercion by the United Nations or anyone else.\n113.\tIsrael instead invites the conquered countries to meet their conqueror and to discuss the size of the fruits of conquest. Israel warns that any talk about any United Nations resolutions, about any African initiative, about any possible European initiative or about any other initiative will only be met with its displeasure. Today Israel is obviously confident of the military support of the United States of America, due to which it can sustain its occupation of our lands, and confident of the political support of the United States, which would protect it against any United Nations action. The question Tel Aviv asks is, Who is going to get us to do this or get us to do that? The pertinent question it does not ask and which no power-drunk people has ever asked is, Where are the conquerors of yesteryear? Where are the phantoms of the past? Any suggestion other than to accept Israeli demands is and, we are told, always will be, rejected with disdain.\n114.\tWhat is it that the Israelis so disdainfully reject? It is not a secret that they reject the resolutions of the General Assembly. It is not a secret that they reject Ambassador Jarring's aide-memoire of 8 February 1971. It is not a secret that Israel demands that the aide-memoire be dropped and forgotten completely.\n115.\tIf Ambassador Jarring were ever to withdraw his aide-memoire although that would mean that the Assembly would also have to withdraw its resolution 2799 (XXVI) of last year then, of course, our reply accepting the suggestions contained in that aide-memoire would not exist. That is why I feel I am bound, as a responsible person not only before this Assembly but also before history, to bring to the attention of this Assembly what it was that Egypt agreed to, and up to this very minute still agrees to, in its search for an honorable peace, in its battle to win peace. Please excuse my taking a few minutes to do so. We here keep referring to documents by numbers and by dates, and in the end we do not really know what those documents contain. On 8 February 1971 Ambassador Jarring handed his aide-memoire to me, and he presented it to Israel on the same day. He stated the following in that aide-memoire:\n\\\"... I wish to request the Governments of Israel and the United Arab Republic to make to me at this stage the following prior commitments simultaneously and on condition that the other party makes its commitment and subject to the eventual satisfactory determination of all other aspects of a peace settlement, including in particular a just settlement of the [Palestinian] refugee problem.\n\\\"Israel would give a commitment to withdraw its forces from occupied United Arab Republic territory to the\nformer international boundary between Egypt and the British Mandate of Palestine on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements are made for:\n\\\"(a) Establishing demilitarized zones;\n\\\"(b) Practical security arrangements in the Sharm el Sheikh area for guaranteeing freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran;\n\\\"(c) Freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal.\n\\\"The United Arab Republic would give a commitment to enter into a peace agreement with Israel and to make explicitly therein to Israel, on a reciprocal basis, undertakings and acknowledgments covering the following subjects:\n\\\"(a) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency;\n\\\"(b) Respect for and acknowledgment of each other's sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence;\n\\\"(c) Respect for and acknowledgment of each other's right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries;\n\\\"(d) Responsibility to do all in their power to ensure that acts of belligerency or hostility do not originate from or are not committed from within their respective territories against the population, citizens or property of the other party;\n\\\"(e) Non-interference in each other's domestic affairs.\\\" Ambassador Jarring added:\n\\\"In making the above-mentioned suggestion I am conscious that I am requesting both sides to make serious commitments but I am convinced that the present situation requires me to take this step.\\\" \nHe also said that by \\\"security measures in Sharm el Sheikh\\\" he meant the presence of United Nations forces in the area.\n116.\tEgypt's answer was \\\"yes\\\". What was Israel's answer? All those who are of my age know that for 25 years every Zionist leader, every partisan and defender of Israel, has repeatedly said that this is exactly what Israel is thirsty for, that this is why it is fighting and struggling, that this is why it is collecting all the money it can from everywhere and everyone, and that this is why it is exacting taxes from every Jew in the world. And that was given by our answer of \\\"yes\\\". However, Israel's answer regardless of how obliquely it was given-was \\\"no\\\".\n117.\tHow can the international community stand idly by when faced with Israel's defiance? \\\"No\\\" was the answer to\nthe General Assembly resolutions. \\\"No\\\" was the answer to the Secretary-General. The Special Representative Ambassador Jarring, got the same answer: \\\"No\\\". \\\"No\\\" was the reaction to the effort of the four permanent members of the Security Council to draw up guidelines for Ambassador Jarring. \\\"No\\\" was the answer even to the continuation of these consultations. \\\"No\\\" was the answer to the attempts of the 10 distinguished leaders of Africa last year. \\\"No\\\" was the response to the considered views of the non-aligned countries. Western European views are similarly confronted by this ominous \\\"No\\\". In short, Israel says \\\"No\\\" to everyone and everything that will not bring about submission to its will. This is a cold, calculated policy seeking to assert that in the Middle East Israel's word as the dominating power will henceforth be the law.\n118.\tAs has been repeatedly stated in previous years, the history of Palestine in the past half century reveals that political Zionism is bent on expansion in an endeavor to dominate as much of the Middle East as it possibly can. It never lacked pretexts for expansion. It does not lack them now. It will not lack them in future. Following the Second World War, humanitarian considerations were used to plead for the partition of Palestine. At that time Israel's leaders did not preach the irrelevance of the United Nations. They considered the United Nations General Assembly the most suitable and legal vehicle they could use to achieve their objectives. Talk about the necessity for direct negotiations between the parties and the inadmissibility of adjudication and coercion was not yet fashionable in those days. Considering the United Nations General Assembly as the vehicle which would give them partition, the Zionists fought for partition and declared themselves content with the resolution they got on 29 November 1947, 181 (II).\n119.\tPolitical Zionism -was not really satisfied with the boundaries allotted to the Jewish State in that resolution. Further expansion to usurp other parts was needed to satisfy the Zionist dream of dominating the totality of Palestine. This was brought about by terrorizing the Palestinians. Women and children were massacred, houses dynamited, villages razed. These actions were perpetrated by specially organized terror groups directed by some of the better-known Israeli leaders of today.\n120.\tTerror and violence organized and premeditated were thus introduced by the Zionists into peaceful Palestine. On 8 February this year-exactly one year after Israel was offered peace and refused to commit itself to it-at an open meeting in Tel Aviv under the sponsorship of one of Israel's former cabinet ministers, the two men who blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946, killing 95 residents, were publicly identified. They gave a press conference describing their action in detail. At that press conference, the two Israelis revealed how they had disguised themselves as Arabs, wearing Arab dress, in order to carry out this operation. Despite their open confession, the Israeli Government took no action against them and did not even criticize their public glorification. That was in February 1972.\n121.\tThere will always be a pretext for Zionist expansionism and the Israeli reluctance to face the possibilities of real peace. This year the pretext brought to this Assembly is terrorism a terrifying word. But who is using it? Who is complaining? Is it the State of Israel, a State of terrorists run by terrorists which is encouraged and protected in order to terrorize the nations around it lest they should ever decide to live for themselves, independent of colonial States. As time goes on, other pretexts are sure to be found as and when needed.\n122.\tThe Palestinian people, some two and a half million of the Middle East's most civilized and energetic people, are all now either living as third-rate subjects under Israeli domination or in sordid camps that can hardly protect them from the wrath of the Phantom jets in the hands of Israel, or else in a diaspora, promising themselves and their children never to forget or forgive, looking with bitterness and skepticism and who can blame them? -at this world and at the United Nations, and at our resolutions adopted annually during the past quarter of a century.\n123.\tHaving occupied all of Palestine, the Israelis invaded the international borders of the neighboring Arab States in June 1967. This time the pretext for the invasion and the following occupation was Israel's so-called security requirements. For Israel, security obviously means the perpetuation of a state of superiority in armaments that should ensure that the Arabs will never be able to regain anything that Israel may decide it needs or likes. With this superiority in armaments, and in pursuance of its expansionist designs, Israel has had an open-ended opportunity to effect all the changes it wishes to bring about in the occupied territories.\n124.\tThe increasingly deteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian territory of Gaza is evidence of this Israeli policy. Gaza has been subjected to a premeditated policy of depopulation and change of demographic structure and geographic composition in a manner fitting Israeli expansionist plans, but certainly contravening the 1949 Geneva Convention, which strictly prohibits the establishment of settlements in occupied territories, the forcible deportation of the civilian population, the destruction of houses and villages and changes in the geographic structure and demographic composition of the occupied territories. \n125.\tSimilar acts have been and are now being committed by Israel in Egyptian Sinai, in the Syrian Golan heights, Jerusalem and on the west bank. The reports of the Red Cross, the United Nations committees of investigation, the various articles published in the world press and the statements issued by many international humanitarian organizations all attest that the situation in those territories is intolerable. Consequently, the measures undertaken by Israel in the occupied territories have been considered war crimes and an affront to humanity by the Commission on Human Rights. The Foreign Minister of Israel calmly tells us, however, in his speech in this debate, that Israel applies humanitarian principles. Israel has, according to him, increased the number of television sets in the hands of the people under its occupation.\n126.\tYet we in Egypt are for peace. We are for the full implementation of all United Nations resolutions on the\nMiddle East. To achieve this objective and in pursuance of our determination to support the United Nations efforts, we have co-operated with the United Nations and its Secretary-General; we have extended unreserved cooperation to his Special Representative.\n127.\tIn order further to facilitate the realization of a just peace, the President of Egypt proposed on 4 February 1971 an initiative providing for the evacuation of Israeli occupation forces in two stages. The President declared that, upon Israel's withdrawal to the lines of the first stage, Egypt would be willing to accept a cease-fire for a specific period, during which the Secretary-General's Special Representative would prepare a timetable for the implementation of all the provisions of the Security Council resolution. During that stage Egypt would start clearing the Suez Canal with a view to opening it to international navigation. Egyptian forces would cross the Canal to assume their national responsibilities on the eastern bank and protect the Canal and the Egyptian cities along its side. The second stage would then follow. The Israeli occupation forces would evacuate the territories they occupied after 5 June 1967, and all the other provisions of the Security Council resolution would be fully carried out in conformity with the aforementioned time-table. The evacuation of Egyptian territory can only mean the withdrawal of Israeli forces of occupation to the Egyptian, internationally recognized, borders with Palestine under the British Mandate.\n128.\tUnited States Secretary of State Rogers once alluded to these international borders as being \\\"some 50 years old\\\" that is twice the life of the Israeli presence in the area. This may be its age according to modern history, but anyone who has learned his history from a French or an Arabic book\u2014I do not know about English books knows that these boundaries are exactly 4,250 years old, these internationally recognized borders between Egypt and Palestine, all of Palestine, which was partitioned in 1947.\n129.\tIt is relevant to recall here what two Presidents, the President of the last session of the Assembly and you yourself, Sir, said at the opening of this session. Mr. Adam Malik said:\n\\\"I remain steadfast in my belief, however, that the only road to a peaceful settlement will have to go by way of strict compliance, by all concerned, with all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions adopted with regard to this problem.\\\" [2032nd meeting, para. 13.]\nAs for you, Sir, you said:\n\\\"In the Middle East region, too, there are still no signs of a lasting peace. The United Nations has committed its authority to help settle this long-standing dispute. We have a right to demand that the will and the decisions of our Organization be respected, decisions which, if fully complied with, should bring about the solution so earnestly desired, most of all by the population of that region.\\\" [Ibid., para. 35.]\n130.\tIsrael's utter disregard for the United Nations and its resolutions has already been exposed by many speakers. For example, this morning the Hungarian Foreign Minister,\nMr. Janos Peter, has given us a short, precise expose on the question. Most of the speakers have gained our gratitude for all they have said on the matter. However, the question will be examined later by this Assembly when the items on the Middle East [item 21] and Palestine [items 40 and 42] are considered. We shall have more to say at that time. At this stage, it seems only proper to stress that merely extending views and advancing proposals would not be adequate. It also seems important to declare that to hope that the mere passage of time will bring Israel more and more concessions, other than those made to it in February 1971 and to wait for that is an idle hope. That will never happen.\n131.\tI am confident that I need not remind the General Assembly that according to Article 1 of the Charter one of the primary purposes of the United Nations is to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the common ends. The examination of this question must lead to effective collective action to uphold our Charter. Inaction would only be condoning aggression. What is required now is the taking of action joint international action-to restore United Nations credibility and to save the United Nations as the world organ for the maintenance of peace.\n132.\tOther important problems facing the world of today will, of course, be discussed by the Assembly. In all these, and in other problems not before the United Nations, the confrontation is between the rich and powerful nations, on the one hand, and the subjected, poor, weaker and less advanced nations, on the other. In every situation the strong and rich seem to be seeking to get stronger and richer at the expense of the poor and less advanced. This is a tragic state of affairs, a sad heritage of the pre-Charter era, showing an unbelievably retarded mentality that fails to understand that the world as a whole can never now live half free and strong and half subjugated and poor.\n133.\tThe exploiters of the valiant peoples in South Africa should be made to know that sooner rather than later Angola will be free, Mozambique will be free, Guinea (Bissau) will be free, Zimbabwe will be a sovereign African State, and Namibia will have its own representatives in this family of nations. What the rulers of Portugal and Rhodesia and the racists in South Africa are trying to do is simply to stop the irresistible winds of change. We regret the lives and energies that are being needlessly sacrificed and the time that is irretrievably lost. Vicious attempts against Senegal and Guinea have already been defeated. Left to themselves, the countries of Africa were able to put a quick end to the disputes which could no longer be fanned from outside. We rejoice in the successes obtained by the States of Somalia, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire in their latest efforts for conciliation and peace. We hope similar successful efforts will be repeated everywhere, in all areas of tension and not in Africa alone.\n134.\tIn Asia, the movements for liberation and unity shall be victorious. In IndoChina, in Viet-Nam and in Korea the determination of those brave and ancient peoples to reach their objectives will certainly bring their struggle to a successful end. What a loss of time and lives to resort to such bombardments as those alluded to by the Foreign Minister of Sweden today-and we know that colleagues in the diplomatic missions of France and Algeria have been victims of that indiscriminate attack.\n135.\tIn IndoChina, In Viet-Nam and in Korea, I repeat, the determination of their brave peoples will bring their struggle to a successful end. An end to the era of colonialism and exploitation is sure to come everywhere. Let us all try to shorten this useless struggle. Let us welcome all these freedom fighters not only as observers, as we have fortunately decided to do, but also as full Member States.\n136.\tThe United Nations stands to gain in strength if the principles of universality are fully respected. No sovereign, peace-loving country should be barred from membership in our Organization. Divided countries wishing to join the United Nations should, and I hope will, be admitted.\n137.\tTo fight racism, efforts are currently being undertaken to launch a decade for vigorous and continued mobilization against racism and racial discrimination. We know that the majority of Member States will fully co-operate. The decade should lead to real progress towards the elimination of the miserable evils of racism and racial discrimination.\n138.\tThe economic and monetary situation in the world obviously affects the well-being and future of all States. Judging from the meager results attained during the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] it is hardly possible for the developing nations to look to their future with confidence. When we add the adverse influence of the era of colonialism to that of international monopolies, it appears that concerted action on the part of the developing world is long overdue. All developing countries should fully exercise their sovereign rights over their natural resources in order, first, to accelerate their own national development and, secondly, to strengthen their positions in transactions with foreign enterprises.\n139.\tThe economic situation would certainly be greatly improved if the fabulous sums spent on armaments were ever to be curtailed. While multilateral negotiations on disarmament have achieved a number of important agreements, their partial scope and the fact that not all countries have adhered to them has put severe limitations on their effectiveness and has caused some countries to delay their ratification.\n140.\tThe strengthening of the United Nations as an effective international machinery for safeguarding world peace and security should help the efforts to achieve these disarmament goals, goals which now seem too far away.\n141.\tThe Egyptian delegation will naturally deal with all these problems as they come up for discussion in the plenary meetings of this Assembly as well as in committee. As a non-aligned nation our attitude in those discussions will always be guided by the spirit and letter of the Charter.\n142.\tAs a member of the Arab League and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], as a Moslem and a Mediterranean country and as a non-aligned member of our United Nations, Egypt seeks to intensify its co-operation with all nations in order to live in greater dignity and freedom and to strive, in a context of peace, towards progress and advancement. This is the real test of the success or failure of our foreign policy.\n143.\tIn the 12 months since we last met in this Assembly hall, and as a step following our federation with the Syrian Arab Republic and the Libyan Arab Republic, Egypt and Libya have been studying steps towards achieving greater unity between themselves. With all other Arab States Egypt actively works for, and sincerely seeks, co-operation to the extent they desire. In order to achieve our common objectives, first, to defeat aggression, and then to accelerate our steps along the road to progress, we will not spare any possible effort.\n144.\tIn the African family we are as active as we can be in the service of the objectives of the charter of the OAU. We remember and register our gratitude for the efforts of the African States and their great leaders' endeavors last year to bring justice and peace to our land. We also express our deep appreciation, because at its last meeting in Rabat last June the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU again clearly manifested its solidarity with and loyalty to the concepts of freedom, justice and peace the concepts of both the charter of the OAU and the Charter of the United Nations.\n145.\tTogether with our African sister-States, we go on co-operating with the great and ancient nations of Asia in our wider African-Asian group, serving the same ideals and defending the same concepts.\n146.\tWe turn to our other partners in the third world, the States of Latin America, and express our gratitude and appreciation for their stand for what is legal and right and for their opposition to the dictates of arrogant power.\n147.\tThe visits that my predecessor made to some of these Latin American countries provided us with an even clearer picture of their correct and sympathetic attitudes and policies.\n148.\tThe family of the non-aligned, at their last meeting in Georgetown in August 1972,  assured us again that those who wish to live by the law of nations would never fail strongly and firmly to uphold its principles in the face of any situation.\n149.\tThe situation in Europe is developing towards increased rapprochement and co-operation. This is a welcome trend, which will contribute towards promoting a more comprehensive and stable peace. The convening of a European security conference is no longer an idle dream. We are convinced that conditions prevailing in Europe are bound to affect other areas within the immediate vicinity. Instability in Europe has in the past adversely affected our region. Similarly, a stable and durable peace in Europe would affect our peace. Europe has a direct stake in a just peace in the Middle East.\n150.\tI wish to refer in passing, but with profound personal gratitude, to the visits I paid to Rome, London and Brussels, and to the visits that my predecessor paid to the great cities of Paris and Belgrade. I hope that all obstacles will soon be removed so that our renewed relations with Bonn will be as strong and fruitful as we sincerely wish them to be.\n151.\tAll the socialist countries of Europe, as you well know, have stood, together with the Soviet Union, by our side since the 1967 aggression and have extended to us in our hour of need their unforgettable assistance. A grateful Egypt will not forget this support and will always seek to strengthen its friendship with these and all other peoples.\n152.\tYet Egypt has no more fervent wish than to live in freedom and at peace in a world ruled by law. We wish to develop closer ties of co-operation and friendship with all States Members, of this Organization which, faithful to its Charter, desire to live by its concepts and strive to serve its purposes.\n153.\tIn this context, Egypt believes it to be in the interest of every nation to try to preserve the United Nations as the political organization whose main work is the attainment of justice and peace for all. Rather than placing limits on its competence, we must all seek to strengthen its role. The United Nations should remain our hope for the future, it should not be a burden from the past.\n154.\tThe general debate is approaching its conclusion. We have listened to the valuable remarks, views and suggestions made by the majority of the wise Foreign Ministers of the world and chiefs of delegations, almost all of whom have expressed their loyalty to the United Nations and its Charter, and have renewed their confidence in them.\n155.\tAt previous sessions we have been called upon, in many documents, to assert that confidence and faith: in the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] and in the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], in the Declaration on the Occasion of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations [resolution 2627 (XXV)].\n156.\tWe also have before us two new items which show the concern of its authors about the same subject: we have items 24 and 25, submitted by Romania and by the USSR, respectively. In each case the motivating concern was the same, and the purpose almost identical: having fought the wars of the past, we wish to win peace for the future. For centuries in the past, nations have been subjected to the misery brought about by violence. We all look ahead now to a world advancing in peace under the protection of the law. Let us make it absolutely impossible for anyone to live outside that law.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, New Zealand joins with the previous speakers in offering you its warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency. You have already brought efficiency and vigor to the conduct of our work. Like other speakers, I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to my personal friend, Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who presided so admirably over last year's arduous session.\n174.\tWe meet this year oppressed by the tragic events of recent weeks. A new and horrible form of savagery has been visited upon a desperately vulnerable and unprepared world. Yet this year more than most has been marked by the promise of a new era of international peace and stability. For most of its life the United Nations has mirrored the mutual suspicions and hostilities that characterized the attitude of the super-Powers over that period. Now the easing of tension in the relationships among the great Powers is reflected in a growing pattern of reconciliation among the smaller Powers. The courageous initiative of President Nixon, the summit talks in Peking, Moscow, Warsaw and elsewhere and other vigorous moves towards detente, particularly by the two super-Powers, are in the best spirit of the Charter. As both a courtesy and a duty we should pay a tribute to all the Powers concerned for the prospect of a new peace which seems to lie ahead of us.\n175.\tAnother development in international relationships that is welcome to New Zealand, as a country having a special interest in the European Economic Community, is the impending enlargement of that Community through the entry of the United Kingdom and other new members. We look forward to the emergence of a stronger, more outward-looking and united Western Europe. The trend towards reconciliation between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe is gathering momentum. The negotiation of non-aggression treaties between West Germany and Poland and between West Germany and the Soviet Union and the four-Power agreement on Berlin were welcome first steps in that direction. We strongly hope that the current negotiations between the two Germanys will end in an agreement that will permit us very soon to welcome both to membership in the United Nations,\n176.\tThe changes in great-Power relationships have modified the policies of countries in the area of the world of most direct interest to New Zealand. I refer to Asia and the Pacific. We have been especially encouraged by the Simla meeting between the President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India aimed at settling peacefully the differences between their two countries. The major problems, of course, are not yet solved; but the way has been opened for a durable settlement in the subcontinent under which the three countries of the region will be able to live together in peace. I would emphasize that New Zealand earnestly feels the need for such a settlement.\n177.\tLast year's crisis in East Pakistan caused human suffering on a vast and frightening scale. New Zealand, small though it is, has not hesitated to draw attention to the material and political needs which had to be met in order to end that tragic situation. The new State of Bangladesh has emerged from the chaos and suffering. However, independence alone and of itself cannot put an end to human misery. The reconstruction and development of Bangladesh represents an enormous task which the new Government cannot be expected to accomplish without massive external assistance. A great deal has already been done, both by the United Nations and by individual countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Indian Government, specifically, have successfully tackled a refugee operation larger than any ever before undertaken in the history of the world. The United Nations and non-governmental bodies have undertaken rehabilitation operations on an unprecedented scale and have thus averted more widespread suffering in the new nation. We in New Zealand have tried to help wherever we can to reduce the suffering in Bangladesh and to promote peace and stability among fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations on the subcontinent. However, much more needs to be done. In such a vast undertaking it is essential that all partners have the full support and co-operation of the others. For this practical reason, New Zealand believes it is important that Bangladesh should be admitted to the United Nations as soon as possible.\n178.\tBy a happy coincidence, the agreement between India and Pakistan was followed almost immediately by one between two other Asian neighbors, North and South Korea. That agreement opens the way for the deep and bitter hostilities of the past to be worked out by the Koreans themselves. In due course the Organization will no doubt have a role to play. At this juncture, however, we believe that the Assembly took a very wise decision when last week it deferred consideration of the Korean items [2036th meeting], thereby acknowledging that the two Koreas should have the opportunity, and should be encouraged, to come to terms with each other.\n179.\tThe movement in Asia towards reconciliation has not so far been reflected in Indochina and VietNam, in Laos and in the Khmer Republic but it is not for want of effort on the part of South Vietnam and its friends. The United States has offered to withdraw all its forces in return for an internationally supervised cease-fire and the return of the American prisoners. The United States and South Viet-Nam together have offered to hold new elections in which the national liberation front can take its full part in organizing the elections and to have the elections internationally supervised. President Thieu of South Vietnam has offered to resign before the elections take place. My Government supports these proposals, which are directed towards obtaining a just and durable peace settlement in that part of the world.\n180.\tThe encouragement that countries have had this year to seek a peaceful resolution of their differences has also been reflected in the Pacific region. New Zealand, Australia and a number of newly independent small nations of the South Pacific have been developing a very real spirit of community and co-operation. More recently the most outstanding evidence of this spirit has been the creation of what is known as the South Pacific Forum. In that Forum the government leaders of Fiji, Tonga, Western Samoa, Nauru, the Cook Islands, Australia and New Zealand have met together to discuss issues of practical interest to our Governments and peoples. As was mentioned by my Australian colleague yesterday, Papua New Guinea has been invited to observe the next meeting. The first Forum, held in Wellington in August last year, has been followed in 1972 by two further meetings, one in Canberra, Australia, and the other in Suva, Fiji. Talks have covered a very wide range of subjects. However, it is a measure of the Forum's concern with immediate practical issues that it has already established a South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. This is a serious effort to stimulate new thinking and create greater opportunities for the development of trade and economic advancement throughout that vast area of the Pacific Ocean, particularly in the south.\n181.\tThere is scope for a much greater involvement by the United Nations in the economic progress of the developing countries and the newly independent countries of the South Pacific. Perhaps because of their geographical remoteness, the problems of these countries too have seemed remote to other countries. Yet only a very little more attention, as measured in the total United Nations effort, would do so much more for these small and isolated communities. For that reason we are very pleased that the Asian Development Bank has accepted the independent island nations of the South Pacific as members and that loans are already being made available to them. Also, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is becoming increasingly involved in the development of the island nations, as are the United Nations Development Program, UNICEF and the specialized agencies concerned. However, I repeat that there is still much more to be done in that area.\n182.\tOver the years, New Zealand has involved the United Nations in the process of decolonization as it applied to New Zealand's island Territories. Some years ago we invited the United Nations missions to observe the act of self- determination in the former Trust Territory of Western Samoa, and also in the Cook Islands. This year the Assembly will have a report from a visiting mission of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which at New Zealand's invitation visited the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Nive [A/8723/Rev. 1, chap. XVI, annex I]. That mission was under the able leadership of Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. In my own Government's view, the report of the Committee is a very well-balanced, fair and, we believe, helpful document. We hope it will do more than enable the Assembly to consider the political issues to which the report itself was directed. It should also lead to a greater understanding of the special problems of survival and development faced by other very small dependent Territories.\n183.\tA minute ago I touched upon the remoteness of the problems of the South Pacific as seen by the rest of the world, and perhaps especially by the European countries. I draw attention now to the serious apprehension which exists in that vast area about the continuance of nuclear testing in the Pacific region.\n184.\tThere is a regional concern because this year a further series of nuclear tests was conducted in the Tuamoto archipelago, and that is the fifth such series since 1967. My Government is aware that the problem of nuclear weapons testing is a global one and that nuclear tests are at present being conducted by four different nations. We also realize that nuclear testing is a part of the wider problem of the nuclear arms race. But I want to make it quite clear here today that the continuation of atmospheric nuclear testing in French Polynesia is deeply resented by the people of the whole of the South Pacific region and, indeed, of the North Pacific as well.\n185.\tAt its meeting in Fiji earlier this month, the South Pacific Forum that I spoke of earlier unanimously expressed its deep concern that the French Government, in conducting its latest nuclear tests, should have failed to recognize the wishes of the people of the South Pacific area, despite the views so clearly expressed by the Governments and the peoples of those countries. The Forum strongly reaffirmed its opposition to all such nuclear experiments anywhere in the world.\n186.\tIn support of that standpoint, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, referred to again this afternoon, has asked all States intending to carry out nuclear weapons tests to abandon those plans.  Countries in Asia, and in Latin America bordering the Pacific, have declared their total opposition. It is our intention to seek the Assembly's endorsement of these calls to cease all nuclear weapons testing.\n187.\tNuclear testing is an issue on which the smaller States have had to speak bluntly to some of the larger Powers whose activities affect us.\n188.\tIn the debate last year [1955th meeting], the New Zealand representative spoke of the great Powers taking policy decisions that profoundly affect the economic stability of smaller nations. There is still a pressing need for the great Powers to recognize that smaller economies can rock dangerously in the waves of their major-policy decisions. There is still a pressing need for a further liberalization of world trade and monetary matters. New Zealand attaches considerable importance to a successful outcome of the multilateral trade negotiations under the framework of GATT in 1973. The Kennedy Round failed to meet our hopes.\n189.\tNew Zealand, like so many other, smaller countries, is heavily dependent on trade in primary agricultural commodities. We are vitally concerned, on that account, with the progress that will have to be made with eliminating or reducing barriers to trade in agricultural products. The developing countries quite rightly want to have their say in these talks, in these negotiations, in these kinds of decisions. Like us, they are less interested in tariff reductions on industrial products, which seem to be the pervading preoccupation of such talks, than in primary products. There are few benefits for smaller and developing nations in enhancing the economic advantages of the great industrial Powers. But I urge the need for less international charity and more true international economic reality.\n190.\tI suggested that the past year has seen the advent of a more favorable general political climate. Unfortunately, it will also be remembered as a year in which the resort to terrorism, individual killing of totally innocent and unsuspecting people, mass cruelty, mistreatment, and even genocide, have left a very tragic mark. Private violence as a means of influencing issues between States must be condemned as strongly as State violence against States, which of course is proscribed by our Charter.\n191.\tThe revulsion to which violence gives rise, in the minds of all people throughout the world, renders these horrible actions politically sterile and useless, indeed counterproductive. It does not further the cause which they variously profess to espouse. Take two outstanding examples: those who claim to speak for the Palestinian and the Croatian peoples. What this violence does do is to increase the readiness of Governments to concert their actions to halt this scourge throughout the world.\n192.\tThe New Zealand Government approves the efforts made by the Secretary-General to seek a greater awakening of the United Nations interest in these horrible actions and events.\n193.\tIn the field of human rights, the right to life and security of person must have first place in anyone's scale of priorities. Nobody will underestimate the difficulties of grappling with the subject of international terrorism. Yet, it is surely right that this subject should be on our agenda. It will be a sad reflection on our strength of purpose and on the capacity of this Organization if no effective means can be found to eliminate the threat to innocent lives which this modern phenomenon presents.\n194.\tAt the same time, we must not overlook other problems of human rights which may gravely affect very large numbers of people in particular areas of the world. The question of people of Asian origin expelled from Uganda is a case in point, as was already mentioned. My Government understands the wish of the Government of Uganda, or of any other Government, to ensure that the control of its economy remains largely in the hands of its own nationals. But there is more than one way of implementing such policy, and many countries have shown the way.\n195.\tThe decision taken by the Uganda Government involves the abrupt wrenching from their own homes and the expulsion from the country of people who, for the most part, have that country as their only home and who spring from generations of people who haVe lived in that country. The New Zealand Government, which has offered a place in our own multiracial society to some of those expelled from Uganda, hopes that the Government of Uganda will even now reconsider the decision that it has taken. We would expect that, at the least, a more reasonable time limit for departure will be set and that, having regard to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the persons concerned will be allowed to transfer from the country those assets to which they have an undoubted personal right. And so we strongly support the initiative taken by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom. My delegation, as you can see, is in favor of his request for the inclusion in the agenda of a new item entitled \\\"International implications of the expulsion of the Asian community from Uganda\\\" [A/8794].\n196.\tBefore I leave the subject of human rights I should like, only very briefly, to refer to three measures taken by the New Zealand Government which may be of interest to some countries represented in this Assembly. First, New Zealand has enacted its own Race Relations Act and should this year ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX), annex]. Secondly, our Government is this year passing legislation providing for the introduction of equal pay for women. New Zealand.was the first country in the world to give women the vote and so we are rather proud to be among the pioneers in making this further contribution to women's rights. The third measure I have in mind is a bill recently introduced in our Parliament which we hope will be passed this year and which will introduce a system whereby accident compensation amounting to 80 per cent of salary will be available to all employed persons who may suffer injury in any circumstances whatever, including accidents such as road accidents or any other kind of accident which is not related in any way to work at their jobs. We regard this as a major social advance and will be happy to provide details to any other countries which may be interested in it.\n197.\tA notable achievement in international co-operation of the best sort has been demonstrated in Stockholm where the Conference on the Human Environment alerted the world community to the dangers created in our environment by mankind's sometimes reckless use of the earth's resources. The fact of the Conference and its achievement is surely evidence of the vitality of this United Nations. I should like to place on record my Government's appreciation for the efforts made by Sweden as host Government to bring about the success of the Conference. We hope that the role played by Mr. Maurice Strong as Secretary-General of that Conference will be further recognized as we consider, I hope at this session, the setting up of new institutions, including a governing council for environmental programs and an environment fund. In anticipation of the Assembly's decision on the Fund, my Government will be prepared to contribute over a five-year period the sum of $320,000.\n198.\tThe future crisis of world population, which will double by the year 2000, is inextricably linked with the problem of the world environment. Great tensions already exist in some parts of the world between populations and the space, natural resources and social structures available to them considerable stress. If these problems are not better understood now and dealt with in a pragmatic and, I hope, understanding way, we will be giving our children a legacy for which they will not thank us and in which we will take very little pride. Our Government is anxious to take its full share in international efforts which must move forward, we believe, speedily. We welcome the decision to hold the World Population Conference in 1974 [resolution 2683 (XXV)]. New Zealand will also continue, as we have in the past, to support the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which, after only two years, is already an active and worth-while agent of this Organization for this global endeavor.\n199.\tNew Zealand has always \\\"been a staunch supporter of the United Nations. New Zealand has always constantly supported the concept of an active role for the Secretary- General, and I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Waldheim. We commend his firm approach to financial and administrative problems and questions at a difficult time. We commend him for the forthright action he has taken to draw the Assembly's attention to the growing question of violence and terrorism. In many more ways also the Secretary-General this year has exercised energetically the powers of initiative with which his office is properly endowed. We trust that he will continue to do so and he is certainly assured of the support and co-operation of New Zealand in that role. \n200.\tAgain, Mr. President, I congratulate you in your high office. I wish you every success in your heavy and demanding task.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I have already, oil this rostrum, had the pleasant occasion to welcome your election and the appointment of our illustrious Secretary-General. Let me now take the opportunity to bring you and this Assembly the good wishes for the success of our deliberations of my President, General Idi Amin Dada, the Government of Uganda and all our people.\n198.\tAs a direct result of a horrendous global conflict this Organization was founded with the firm resolve that never again should mankind engage in an even more suicidal war.\n199.\tIt is true that a hard look at the international scene still reveals unresolved areas of conflict, but it is equally true that this Organization, by providing a meeting point for potential antagonists over a quarter of a century, paved the way for the current detente among those with the capacity to decimate this planet. When we reaffirm our support and belief in this Organization, therefore, it is not a platitude but our deeply rooted conviction that this Organization has ho eqUal for the preservation of the peace of mankind.\n200.\tMy delegation welcomes the current, and apparently genuine efforts among the big Powers to replace confrontation with dialog: between Washington and Moscow; between Peking and Washington; and, coming up, between Moscow and Peking over their frontier disputes. The solutions to the German and Berlin questions should contribute towards a Stable peace in Europe and in the world.\n201.\tWe cannot, however, oversimplify the price for peace. Despite the strategic arms limitation agreements between the superpowers, defense experts continue to show us that the arms race is still on, and that billions of dollars ate still being spent on armaments which, we are told, Would never be used. Nuclear tests still continue to negate the spirit and philosophy under which the nuclear test-ban Treaty was signed. While we have made a promising beginning in the search of peace, It is the view of my delegation that we should not rest this search permanently of false premise on the premise of a balance of terror, as Winston Churchill called it.\n2 )2. The existence of great armaments must surely under- He the eventuality of using them. As long as they exist, despite all the well-meant steps taken to establish peace, they could be used to devastate our world. The better premise for world peace, therefore, must remain the total destruction of all nuclear weapons and a permanent ban on them together with a ban on other highly destructive weapons. So long as big Powers continue their military industrial complexes their products must find use and markets that are provided by war.\n203.\tMy delegation joins the peace-lovers all over the world in demanding peace in Viet-Nam. The staggering waste in this war, in terms of human and material resources, has no justification in a world community that, more than ever, so widely shares a common need for peace and justice. The United States should set the example to us all and show us that a super-Power can exercise self-restraint and respect the independence of others, even if they are small and poor States.\n204.\tIt is our hope, too, that the current winds of peace that are blowing across this planet will sweep through the Middle East to provide a just and lasting solution. As we stated here last year [1943rd meeting], it is the view of my Government that any fair and lasting solution to the Middle East problem must be based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The occupied Arab territories should be vacated in toto by Israel and, in turn, the Arab nations must comply with the conditions of that resolution. It remains a sad commentary on our times that force is still an instrument for acquiring territory or settling international disputes. It seems so clear to us, too, that no lasting solution to this problem on a fair and just basis can be attained without a fair answer to the Palestinian refugee problem. Justice demands that Israel comply with the wishes of the Arab nations.\n205.\tWe in East Africa are directly and adversely affected by the closure of the Suez Canal. Most of our trade goes north to Europe, traditionally through that Canal. Its closure has meant long voyages around South Africa. The undesirable but inevitable consequence has been to enrich the obnoxious minority regimes in southern Africa, as they provide the ports of call. Freight costs have obviously increased. We therefore have a right to demand of Israel that it submit to a fair settlement which would involve the opening of the Canal.\n206.\tIt has now become a tradition that whenever we meet we must talk about decolonization, we must condemn minority racist regimes, we must censure the collaborators with them. But there is something disturbing about all this. Our eloquence in speech, our resolutions on paper in the organs of this Organization, have been as conspicuous as our actions in their actual implementation have been few and feeble.\n207.\tThe number of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on decolonization given in the documentation constituting the basis for the meetings of the Security Council held in Addis Ababa early this year, was impressive. These two organs have since then adopted several other resolutions on various steps to be taken for establishing self-determination and ending minority rule. Little, if any, action, regrettable to say, has followed.\u2003\n208.\tIn Rhodesia, 5.5 million Africans continue to be dispossessed of their fundamental liberties by a minority of a quarter of a million whites. Crimes depriving the majority of their rights continue to be committed by the Smith regime. Millions of Africans have been arbitrarily and forcibly evicted from their lands which they have owned from time immemorial, in order for that land to be reserved to a few whites. Their dwellings and fields have been set on fire by the thousands to effect this eviction. Their leaders have been indefinitely locked up without trial. There is no security to speak of for them. In total disregard of United Nations resolutions on the matter, the United Kingdom, which claims the sovereign right over Rhodesia a claim that this Organization recognizes has refused to assert its authority and ensure human rights and self- determination in Rhodesia. It has totally disregarded the hardships of and overwhelming humanitarian considerations respecting the 5.5 million indigenous Rhodesians; instead, to our amazement, it has attempted to rush this Assembly, supposedly on humanitarian grounds, into action for the benefit of only 65,000 of its nationals who are being legitimately asked to quit my country. What a double standard in international affairs!\n209.\tThere is a saying in English law that if you seek justice in equity you must come with clean hands. The United Kingdom has appealed to this Assembly not formally now, but continuously in private-saying that it is seeking justice for the 65,000 or so people who have been requested to depart from my country. But we should ask, does the United Kingdom come to this Assembly with clean hands? Does it come when it has invariably recognized humanitarian considerations wherever they have affected other peoples, not just the 65,000 who are nationals of the United Kingdom? Does it come after having fulfilled the obligations I have just referred to in relation to the 5.5 million indigenous Rhodesians who are totally dispossessed and in quite a helpless situation? Does it come after having rectified all these things, to ask for justice before this Assembly?\n210.\tYou will answer that; and I am quite convinced that, with the facts set before you, you will answer that the United Kingdom, rather than coming with clean hands, comes with arms shoulder-deep in complicity with the racist regimes and Rhodesia in its course of independence without justification, in complicity with the racists who are depriving our brothers in southern Africa of their rights. I have no doubt that this Assembly will render a judgment that is worthy of it as a world forum for justice.\n211.\tIt seems clear that the United Kingdom Government is in fact making it possible for the Smith regime to establish legitimacy under the umbrella of British protection. The latest British vetoes in the Security Council indicate this. My Government still holds the view, as most Members here do, that Britain should quell the Smith rebellion by force, hold a constitutional conference for all Rhodesians to determine their constitution, and grant independence to a government that is based on majority rule.\n212.\tThe responsibility resting on Portugal for Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) is no less clear. That such a small, distant and relatively poor European State should hold out for so long in its African colonial wars is sad testimony to the manner in which the declared words of some Members here are contrary to their deeds. If some Member States did not directly aid Portugal's war effort, the colonial wars would by now be over. We therefore appeal to them, in particular to the United States of America, to desist from giving material help that will prolong these colonial wars. Whatever happens, it remains an ineluctable fact of human history that the freedom-fighters will ultimately triumph. Our talk here, really, is about what price they should pay for their freedom.\n213.\tMy delegation urges this session to examine more closely, not how many resolutions on decolonization should be adopted, but what action should be taken to implement those already adopted. There are many in the world who are feeling some disillusionment because we have so far failed to match our speeches with deeds. We are facing a credibility gap of increasing magnitude. We owe it to ourselves to do better.\n214.\tClosely associated with decolonization in Africa is the problem of apartheid in South Africa. The resolutions passed and the documents compiled in this Organization on the unspeakable crime of apartheid are matched only by those on decolonization, yet there has been so little done in practice to implement them. The failure is due not only to the apartheid regime, itself but also and this is more important to powerful external support for that regime.\n215.\tNo amount of words by those who hold great investments in South Africa will convince us that they are serious about restoring justice and equity in that society. Indeed, it is true that through their economic interests they, more than any, hold the key to perpetuating the dismantling apartheid. The world will not tire of demanding constructive action from them.\n216.\tWe welcome the recent appointment by our Secretary-General of an experienced diplomat to set the ball rolling towards Namibia's independence and self-determination. But we hold no illusions: the road is long and hard and any emmisary walks along it with great difficulty. Yet it is a beginning. We will not wait for a decade to give Namibia freedom. All the organs competent under the Charter have pronounced the illegality of South Africa's hold on Namibia. It is up to the Member State to give practical meaning to those pronouncements.\n217.\tMy Government will continue to give material and other aid to all freedom-fighters in the Territories I have mentioned. It is the least we can contribute to their struggle for freedom.\n218.\tLet me turn to the world economic situation. As a developing nation, still largely dependent on a few agricultural commodities for the world market, it is crucial for us to have a stable world economic situation. In this connexion the enlargement and consolidation of the European Economic Community will be significant for Africa in general and my country in particular. While we do already have some preferential treatment, the range of items is far too limited and the conditions have much room for improvement.\n219.\tThe European Economic Community, because of its historical past, has a duty to Africa. It is our sincere hope that this newly found economic cohesion in Europe will be used not to perpetuate under-development among our nations but rather to inject more developmental aid to accelerate our economic growth.\n220.\tThere should be no monopolized areas of trade in a rapidly shrinking world. The socialist countries and the United States could help a good deal more than they have hitherto done in the field of economic aid to developing nations.\n221.\tIt was with some regret that my Government noted the results of the third session of UNCTAD, but the fundamental difficulty was not with that session but with the member nations, which alone hold the key to releasing more generous terms to developing nations, both for commodity prices and for foreign aid.\n222.\tIt is too late in the day to have a planetary concept whereby the rich get richer and the poor poorer. We are so interdependent that even those who call themselves super-Powers could not exist without the host of intermediate and small nations of the world.\n223.\tIn this regard it is vital to curtail armaments, in order to release those billions for the betterment of all mankind. Then, truly, the big donors and the big nations of the world would be worthy of greatness and respect. There can be no genuine pride and respect if greatness if greatness it can be called is based principally on one's capability to destroy our planet, including oneself.\n224.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, was a landmark. It is the duty of us all to avoid so upsetting the delicate balance of life and nature on earth that we could soon become a dying planet. My Government is committed to undertaking whatever is essential, in the light of present and future knowledge, to maintain and protect our environment. In this connexion developing nations, not yet saturated with the polluting factors of the industrial States, could make good use of the latest anti-polluting knowledge and techniques and so avoid committing the errors of the industrial States. But the foreign companies exporting technology from the old to the new areas of industry must be rigidly controlled and required to establish new industries in accordance with the best and latest environmental techniques. Old polluting methods should be banned in developing nations and a concerted effort should be made to establish uniformity in this.\n225.\tIt is the view of my Government that the deterioration of the environment in industrial nations, where it is more acutely felt, is accentuated by established economic methods of production, which through self-interest do their best, sometimes, to resist new inventions that might help restore health to such environment. This is an urgent and fundamental, problem which the governments concerned must face with honesty and courage.\n226.\tThe issue of outer space is becoming increasingly important. My delegation welcomes the efforts of those Member States which engage in the utilization of outer space for the betterment of our world. We have supported the relevant treaties on the subject and will in principle support those that are to come. While we rightly engage actively in discussing problems indigenous to our earth, let us not be unmindful that throughout history outer space has had a profound influence on the human race. Who among us has not been struck, on a clear night, by the stupendous majesty of the heavens? Which culture on this planet does not, directly or indirectly, have legends of gods from outer space, influencing the great religions or mythologies of us all?\n227.\tToday, man moves into outer space, not in imagination and thought as before, but in physical reality. These adventures may yet hold the most profound consequences for our planet. It is now generally accepted by most scientists that earth man may not be the only intelligent being in the universe. For that reason my delegation holds the view that those among us who explore outer space have a duty to keep us all fully informed of their findings.\n228.\tShould we, for instance, seriously believe that the American moon program is principally designed to collect moon dust and rocks; or that the Soviet probes to Venus and elsewhere are primarily interested in ascertaining the high temperatures and related climatic matters? We say we are behind you in your explorations, but let us share all your important findings because sooner or later, if they bear relevance and significance to our planet, we are surely bound to do so.\n229.\tThough a land-locked country, Uganda shares the active interest in the exploitation of the resources of the oceans for the betterment of mankind. We have followed the proceedings of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction with close interest, as it is now universally held that those natural resources beyond the limits of sovereign jurisdiction constitute the common heritage of mankind. My Government will support an effective international policy for the exploitation of these resources for the benefit of all.\n230.\tLet me now turn to an issue that has become of direct concern to my country.\n23.1. In his statement on 27 September [2042nd meeting/ the British Foreign Secretary urged this Assembly to support a British move in demanding of my President that he revise his policy of expelling nearly 60,000 foreign nationals, about 55,000 of whom are British citizens. Although I made my reply to him from this rostrum then [2043rd meeting], because I realize that many members of the General Assembly may have been absent I should like briefly to recount the history of this problem, without which it remains distorted and unfairly exploited by anti-Uganda propaganda.\n232. Towards the end of the last century, when the United Kingdom still ruled a colonial empire engulfing the Indian subcontinent and some East African countries, including my own, it systematically organized and promoted an exodus of its subjects from the Indian subcontinent to many of its colonies, including mine. These people were originally brought to East Africa principally to provide the labor for constructing the railway from Mombasa, on the Indian Ocean cost, to my capital city, 850 miles inland. After this, the British organized them and engaged them to settle and to provide an instrument for promoting colonial trade and commerce. By 1900, although there were 2,000 British Asians in the country, they had already established their mastery over our trade and commerce.\n233.\tThe British, who administered Uganda until 1962, systematically ensured that their nationals of Asian extraction continued to dominate our economic life, without any reasonable effort to promote the interests of the indigenous people in this field. The pressure among the Africans became so great that in 1946 and 1947 there were serious riots in my country in protest against this British policy of systematically keeping the Africans out of the economic life of the country. The British colonial officers, instead of looking at the root of the problem, reacted by imprisoning the leaders of riots and suppressing their activities.\n234.\tSince this did not provide the right answer, there was an extensive boycott of all Asian businesses in my country in 1959 which was so effective that it almost paralyzed the economic life of the country. Again, because we were still under British rule, the authorities, instead of recognizing and promoting the legitimate aspirations and interests of the overwhelming majority of the people of Uganda, chose to solve the problem by once more locking up the leaders of the trade boycott and suppressing it.\n235.\tIn 1962 Uganda became an independent sovereign State and was admitted as a Member by this Organization. But the economy was still almost totally dependent on these foreign nationals. If these British nationals had chosen to identify themselves with our country, to which they came poor and in which they made great fortunes, this problem would never have arisen at all. Indeed, I was myself witness to a number of occasions when the illustrious Prime Minister of India, the late Pandit Nehru, urged these British nationals to identify themselves with the countries of their habitual residence. His daughter, the present Prime Minister of India, before she was Prime Minister paid a visit to East Africa and repeated this call. In doing so, these foresighted leaders were in fact echoing what the leaders of my country and other neighboring countries had since independence been urging these British Asians to do, without success.\n236.\tOn independence, a Ugandan citizenship was created. All the indigenous Africans in Uganda automatically became Ugandan citizens. So did any Asian who was born in Uganda and one of whose parents had been born in Uganda. This covered some of these Asians, but not all. In addition, however, anyone among these British Asians could become a citizen by registration, if only he asked the Uganda Government between October 1962 and October 1964 to be registered as a citizen of our Republic. This offer of citizenship would have covered everyone among the people under consideration. Those who registered, or those among them who were qualified by birth, to be citizens have no problem, and they are citizens of my country, with as many rights and duties within the State as any of us has.\n237.\tIt is rare, you will agree with me, that a country offers its citizenship so generously and with so few demands to such a large group of aliens. But it remains a fact that the majority of these people who today are the subject of considerable discussion in fact deliberately, of their own volition, rejected the offer of the Uganda Government to grant them citizenship. Considering that they had made their fortunes in Uganda and that most of them had lived there for so many years, this rejection was not only painful to us, but an insult to our hospitality and to our worth as a nation. We were, in other words, expected to continue to play the role of a host for parasites, without any feeling of obligation on the part of our exploiters. Much damage has been done to our economy as a result of the conduct of these people, who control about 90 per cent of our economic and commercial life but who owe allegiance to foreign Powers. Despite our attempts to block all avenues for transporting money from Uganda, somehow they have always been one step ahead in beating the officials. The result, both unfavorable and regrettable, has been the outflow of money that should otherwise have been used and is so badly needed for our own development. All these factors have combined to give no alternative to my Government but to take the step, long overdue, of asking these aliens to depart for their countries of nationality.\n238.\tI am aware that, quite cleverly, the United Kingdom is not impeaching our right to ask these people to go, but rather is attacking the method by which we have asked them to go. First, they cannot impeach us for asking aliens to go, because it is our right under the Charter to do so. Therefore, our impeachment before you, our censure, must be carried out, in the United Kingdom's view, by reliance on what is called \\\"humanitarian considerations\\\". But you cannot discuss this and get the sense of the. problem in its totality without taking into account the story I have just told.\n239.\tI am aware that the United Kingdom speaks of some thousands who have become stateless among these people. Regrettable as this may be, it was no fault of the Uganda Government. The laws of Uganda on citizenship clearly require that anyone who registers for Ungandan citizenship must renounce his previous citizenship within three months of his registration. These people who are now called stateless were mostly British subjects. When they registered for Ugandan citizenship, they did not comply with this provision requiring them to renounce their previous citizenship within three months. The result was that they purported to become citizens of two countries, which, members here would agree with me, it would be most unusual for any State to permit, most particularly a young State which needs and deserves all the loyalty it can have from its nationals. When the moment came and they were required to present their papers to my Government, it was discovered that these people had not renounced their previous citizenship within a period of three months as stipulated by the Ugandan citizenship act. They therefore had never become citizens of Uganda. We hold that they must revert to their nationality of origin, which was British, or that of other countries which they used to hold. But, to our surprise, we were informed in the General Committee that these are stateless persons. Whether, however, they are stateless, or whether they belong to any State, my Government does recognize one fundamental postulate: that they are, like all of us, human beings.\n240.\tArising from the agitation of the United Kingdom Government at this session on this matter, lodging complaints, some of which were founded on \\\"facts\\\" gathered from newspapers, my President has communicated by his letter of 3 October 1972 to the Secretary-General the position of the Uganda Government on the most sensitive allegations made against us before this Assembly and at the bar of world opinion.\n241.\tMy President has given the following specific assurances, which were never really in doubt on our side, but which were distorted by biased powerful interests.\n242.\tFirst, all the foreign nationals asked to go are being allowed to take personal belongings as well as reasonable amounts of cash with them, which is to be delimited by our financial resources.\n243.\tSecond, there has never been, contrary to astounding allegations of the British Secretary of State, no confiscation of any property belonging to any of the departing aliens. All those who have property in Uganda have been asked to make an inventory of such property on forms which have been provided by our Ministry of Commerce and on the basis of which such property will be sold and the proceeds credited to the accounts of its owners. With regard to those who have bank accounts, such accounts are intact and the money still belongs to them.\n244.\tThird, it is not the intention, nor has it ever been the intention, of the Uganda Government to maltreat the departing aliens. Their transit out of the country, from the capital city, Kampala, to the international airport from which they fly out, is protected by well-organized police escorts to avoid any embarrassing incidents.\n245.\tFourth, it is not, nor has it ever been, the intention of the Uganda Government to maltreat or otherwise oppress any non-citizen who at the end of the deadline of 90 days might still remain in Uganda. This is a critical undertaking which should satisfy all those concerned. It means that those aliens who will still be in the country at the end of the deadline will still enjoy their lives as human beings and that my Government, in recognition of its international obligations, will still accord to them the same protection as it accords to all other foreign nationals resident in our country who are staying there. This, of course, will be so provided that efforts to facilitate the exit of the departing aliens to their new homes are not deliberately slowed down or frustrated.\n246.\tIn this connexion, I wish to point out that the British Asians themselves are satisfied with the arrangements of the Uganda Government, pending their departure. I shall quote from an interview in The Times of London of 27 September 1972, given by a Mr. V. V. Radia, a former Chairman of the Uganda Chamber of Commerce, when he said, together with a colleague:\n\\\"It is the British High Commission\\\" that is, the British Embassy in Kampala-\\\"that is holding up the exodus of the Asians, not the Uganda authorities, who have set up excellent machinery. .. .\n\\\"Among a number of specific demands, they\\\"-that is, Mr. Radia and another person-\\\"asked that the British High Commission should remain open 'around the clock'.\n\\\"The two men claimed that the High Commission is open only five hours a day during the week and is closed at weekends. In contrast, they pointed out that the Bank of Uganda and other local government offices were remaining open throughout weekends to deal with the Asians. . .\\\".\nOne can therefore realize from this that my Government intends to discharge its own share of obligations, but those others involved must correspondingly do likewise.\n247.\tLet me, on behalf of my Government, express our deep appreciation to those countries which have offered entry to these departing aliens. We have given these aliens sanctuary for over 80 years, and we recognize your goodwill in offering to share our problem. A few speakers from this rostrum made some remarks that were most unbecoming to their positions. But, obviously, our opinion of them must have been quite exaggerated.\n248.\tI cannot conclude this general statement without reference to the OAU. The Uganda Government attaches great importance to the role that regional organizations can play in facilitating the implementation of the objectives of the United Nations. A strong and purposeful OAU will add immensely to the purposefulness and effectiveness of this Organization.\n249.\tThe last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at Rabat took some well-considered and specific decisions  on the issues that have for so long engaged us in this Assembly the issues that concern the rights of many millions in Africa who still labor under the despicable yoke of outmoded, indefensible, unpardonable, atrocious colonial rule, and the rule of minority racist regimes. We expect this session to take up the substance of the decisions made at Rabat and to give them practical meaning.\n250.\tMembers must be aware of the current events in East Africa which seemingly show a very disturbing trend for our region. But it is our hope and belief that the efforts by our brothers within the OAU that are already underway will provide a solution to this and other problems, to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned, since the heritage we share in that region far exceeds any transitory misunderstandings we may presently have.\n251.\tThe OAU has not been just a talking club. It has, within less than a decade of existence, demonstrated its practical value in its ability to defuse or solve potentially grave situations on our continent among its member States. It is the intention of my Government to continue strengthening this role of the OAU.\n252.\tFinally, as a general observation, let me reaffirm the belief of my country in the role that the non-aligned countries can play to promote world peace and understanding. True, most of the non-aligned world consists of developing nations. But it is our hope that none here will, either publicly or secretly, equate superior technology with superior wisdom, or, put differently, that none can seriously contend that because we are technologically underdeveloped, we are therefore under-developed in human wisdom and common sense.\n253.\tLet us recall that the greatest sages of all time, men we today constantly turn to for reference and guidance on human problems, like Socrates, Plato, Confucius, Mohammed, Buddha or Jesus, did not live in a mechanized world; they lived in conditions that could today be called primitive by our standards. But they possessed a profound understanding of human nature which, regrettably perhaps, has changed so little over the millenia.\n254.\tSimilarly, from the non-aligned may well come some contribution to a better world which the big Powers would do well to ponder. We diminish rather than crystallize polarities. We offer a meeting point, in ideas and action, that might be impossible to attain by either side in the ideological contest. But we have no desire to be a battleground because, as we say in Africa, when two elephants fight it is the grass that suffers.\n255.\tIn a real sense the United Nations is not weak nor has it failed. If it seems to be weak, it is because its Members are weak in their resolution to make it strong. If it seems to have failed, it is because self-interest among Member States transcends their will to make it succeed. Rather than turn on the United Nations in anger and frustration at its impotence, let us direct our indictment where it is properly due, to those Member States whose declarations of high ideals are equally matched by their capacity to deny them fulfillment.\n256.\tIt is the hope of my delegation that this twenty- seventh session will rise to its high calling, as the world expects it to do; that at long last, no matter how difficult, it will begin to seek to implement the multitude of resolutions that the General Assembly and the Security Council have adopted on varied topics over the years. Let us restore faith in this Organization among all the millions on our planet.\n"

        "file_text": "May I, Sir, congratulate you warmly on your election to the responsible post of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are\nvery glad that the work of this international forum will be guided this year by an outstanding diplomat from fraternal Poland and we are most pleased that you, a representative of the countries of the socialist community, have been elected to that high office.\n73.\tIt was with pleasure that we welcomed the appointment last year of Mr. Kurt Waldheim as the new Secretary-General of the United Nations. We would like to take this opportunity to assure him that he can count on the full support of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in his efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and to increase the effectiveness of its work in carrying out the basic task of the Organization as enshrined in the Charter, namely the maintenance of international peace and security.\n74.\tEvery year the General Assembly is faced with the task of analyzing and assessing the international situation and taking stock of the activities of the United Nations. However, this task should not become mere routine. We ourselves in any case welcome this occasion as a means of encouraging positive developments while exposing and rebuffing the forces of war, imperialism and reaction.\n75.\tThe delegation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic approaches the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly firmly resolved to support the trends towards a relaxation of international tension which have appeared recently and to support the efforts of peace-loving forces to settle controversial international problems by peaceful means. The results achieved in this area are proof that the principle of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems, a principle which has been followed consistently by countries in the socialist community, and in particular by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from its inception 50 years ago, is becoming an increasingly effective and real force in relations between States, for it is fully responsive to the aspirations and vital interests of the peoples.\n76.\tOur delegation approaches the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly with a genuine desire to make a contribution to the solution of those complex and conflicting problems which developments in international relations place on our agenda at a time when the trend towards a better climate is advancing only with great difficulty and by dint of great efforts.\n77.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has always taken an active part in the efforts of the socialist countries to ensure peace and international security. For example it has recently made its contribution to the important measure adopted by the countries of the socialist community, namely the Prague Declaration of the Political Advisory Committee of States parties to the Warsaw Treaty,  which addresses itself to the major issues of the day.\n78.\tIn this regard we welcomed the outcome of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France, during which the basic principles of peaceful coexistence, which operate also in relations between other countries, were affirmed and the results of the summit talks between the Soviet Union and the United States, which affirmed as a basic principle the notion that even the most complicated problems should be solved through negotiation and not by confrontation. We also welcome the other important events that are helping to create favorable conditions for a further relaxation of international tension.\n79.\tAn integral part of the policy pursued by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is its complete support for the United Nations and its objectives, as the leading representatives of our State have frequently stated.\n80.\tIn expressing satisfaction at the increase in positive trends, we are thinking mainly of current developments in Europe.\n81.\tEurope, which has been a constant source of ferment and conflict and in this century alone has been the epicenter of two terrible world wars, is now experiencing one of the longest periods of peace in its whole history.\n82.\tMoreover, since the ratification of a treaty between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany, a treaty between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the agreement on West Berlin setting this positive trend in motion, the continent has been moving towards an extremely significant event, namely the conference on European security and co-operation which the overwhelming majority of European countries have agreed to.\n83.\tWe are extremely glad that the idea of an all-European conference is, in spite of obstacles and every conceivable kind of obstruction, being brought to fruition. Our Government has expressed its agreement and support for the proposal that preparatory talks should be initiated soon at Helsinki. We can only hope that all the participants will approach these talks in a business-like way with a genuine desire to hold a fruitful conference without undue delay. In our opinion the Prague Declaration of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty indicates a reasonable and realistic course in this regard.\n84.\tWe sincerely -believe that strengthening security and expanding co-operation in Europe will be of benefit to the peoples of all continents and will promote a settlement of conflict situations in other parts of the world. A new generation is emerging whose prospective healthy future must be built on a solid and reliable basis.\n85.\tBut in order to maintain permanent peace in Europe the questions which are still pending must be completely settled.\n86.\tOne important movement in that direction is the talks being held between the two German States. Their outcome should establish an appropriate foundation for normalizing relations between the two States on the basis of the principles of international law. We think that in the present circumstances no obstacles should be placed in the way of the admission of the two German States into the United Nations. There is no reason for further delay.\n87.\tThe question also arises, in connexion with efforts to regularize the situation in Europe, of creating conditions for the normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Representatives of our State have often shown goodwill in their attempt to find a path towards mutual understanding; they have also indicated that they are willing to sign a treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany which would be a starting point for regularizing relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. However, before that can be done, the question of the so-called Munich agreement will have to be settled once and for all; that agreement must be recognized as invalid from the start. The brutal Munich diktat initiated the dismembering of the Czechoslovak State, the Nazi occupation of our country and the untold suffering of our people; it also heralded the Second World War. We believe that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will take a realistic approach to this question and will help to ensure that the frontier between our countries is a frontier that will encourage constructive and peaceful co-operation; that would, without a doubt, have a favorable effect on the general climate in Europe.\n88.\tThe development of constructive relations not only with our neighbors but with other countries in Western Europe and other continents in the political, economic, scientific, technological and cultural fields is becoming an integral part of the general positive movement in Europe and throughout the world.\n89.\tThe efforts we have been making to ensure peace and security in Europe do not imply, however, that we will not do our utmost to help solve the urgent problems that have arisen in other continents.\n90.\tThis is particularly so since dangerous hotbeds of tension still exist and the cruel war continues in Indochina where the United States aggression has recently been escalated even further. The blockade of ports in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the unprecedented scale and methods of bombing by the United States Air Force are shaking the very foundations of life in the countries in that region and are bringing untold suffering to the civilian population. We strongly condemn these acts and repeat once again that we fully support the people struggling in Viet-Nam and the other peoples in Indo-China. The only way to bring peace to Viet-Nam is to respect the inalienable right of the Vietnamese people to decide their own fate freely without any foreign interference whatsoever. We fully support the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September and of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam of 14 September this year concerning a peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam conflict.\n91.\tAnother area of continuing dangerous tension in the world is the Middle East where Israeli aggression has led to a persistent state of conflict. We strongly favor removal of the consequences of this aggression on the basis of the unconditional implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n92.\tCan our Organization continue to remain a passive bystander while the Israeli Government, under cover of its protectors, persists in sabotaging the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Jarring, and while Israel blocks all progress towards a peaceful settlement and continues its aggressive actions against the neighboring Arab countries?\n93.\tWe support the just struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable and legitimate rights. While we cannot agree to the acts of terrorism which, like the recent tragedy in Munich, only serve the cause of the opponents of a peaceful and just settlement in the Middle East, neither can we agree that anti-terrorism measures should constitute a pretext for crushing a just national liberation struggle.\n94.\tWe must put a halt to all terrorist activities throughout the world, for they only disrupt the peaceful life of ordinary people and disturb international relations, an example of this being the hijackings of our aircraft in the course of which a Czechoslovak pilot was murdered.\n95.\tA reflection of the positive trends in present-day international relations is to be found in the talks held between the leaders of India and Pakistan, the productive results of which we welcomed. The basic prerequisite for ensuring a lasting peace and mutually advantageous cooperation between the countries of the Indian subcontinent is, we feel, the recognition of the existing realities. That means first of all the recognition of the People's Republic of Bangladesh as a separate and independent State which meets all the requirements for admission as a Member of the United Nations. The admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations would unquestionably further the realization of the principle of universality of the Organization, and it would promote United Nations activities and enhance its prestige. It is for that reason that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic fully supports the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations.\n96.\tWe also welcome the first positive results of the efforts exerted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea over many years for a peaceful settlement on the Korean peninsula. We would hope that here, as elsewhere, the progressive and peaceful efforts being made will be crowned with success. However, we cannot attain that objective simply by closing our eyes to the injustice done in the past, unfortunately under cover of the United Nations flag. It is indeed high time for the United Nations to do its part towards the early peaceful reunification of the country, without outside interference. The constant and unjustified postponing of this item cannot assist positive developments in the Korean peninsula; it only shows up the forces that do not desire a peaceful settlement in that region.\n97.\tFor the United Nations to function effectively as an instrument for ensuring international peace and security it must be constantly strengthened as a political organization capable of fulfilling its paramount purpose. The task facing this session in that particular regard is to determine whether, and if so how, the principal resolutions adopted in previous years are being fulfilled, in particular the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].\n98.\tWe welcome the initiative taken by the Soviet Government in submitting to the General Assembly a new and important item entitled \\\"Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [A/8793], This new Soviet item should make possible the adoption of measures which we frankly believe would be of great help in creating conditions for peacefully solving all outstanding problems, without the use of force, conditions that would eliminate the danger of war and armed conflict between States. The non-use of force and a simultaneous permanent ban on the use of all types of weapons, including nuclear weapons, would place all countries in the world on the same footing so that none of them would have any unilateral military advantage.\n99.\tIn connexion with considerations of international security, we feel we must stress the importance of the Charter of the United Nations as a permanent instrument for ensuring general peace and security. There is no way of changing the Charter that would give the activities of the United Nations a more positive orientation. There is only one way to improve the activities of the Organization, and that is to pursue consistently the purposes for which it was established and to apply creatively and implement effectively the basic principles and provisions of the Charter.\n100.\tOne of the key targets of Czechoslovak foreign policy is disarmament, which is also a top-priority task of the United Nations closely connected with ensuring peace and security. We have always participated very actively in disarmament negotiations.\n101.\tWe see the bilateral agreements between the USSR and the United States on the limitation of strategic nuclear weapons, concluded in May this year,  as a significant step forward in the field of disarmament. The agreements bear witness to the fact that in disarmament, too, substantial progress can be made. However, it is essential to reach a decisive turning-point in disarmament generally. We submit that a suitable place for this might be the World Disarmament Conference, which was proposed by the Soviet Union and endorsed by the General Assembly at last year's session [resolution 2833 (XXVI)].\n102.\tWe feel that this year we could set a final date for the World Disarmament Conference and reach agreement on how to prepare for it. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is ready to take an active part in the preparatory work.\n103.\tThe United Nations is forced with the further task of assisting in completing the process of decolonization, including the complete elimination of all remnants of colonialism throughout the world in accordance with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples which was adopted in 1960. In southern Africa the gravest injustice is still being done to the indigenous populations of the Republic of South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and the Portuguese colonies, primarily because certain NATO Powers, in violation of United Nations resolutions, are giving extensive assistance to the colonialist and racist regimes in those countries. The General Assembly should draw the appropriate conclusions as to the seriousness of the situation from this year's report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on the implementation by Member States of the relevant United Nations resolutions [A/8723/Rev.l, chap. VII].\n104.\tIn reviewing the present-day situation in the world, we cannot overlook the problems of economic development and relations between States, particularly since restrictions are still being place on opportunities for international trade and other forms of economic relations. I am thinking in particular of the negative effects of the Western Europe integrationist groupings and the measures they have been taking which, in view of their closed nature, are impeding the development of fruitful international co-operation.\n105.\tSocialist economic integration, on the other hand, creates favorable conditions for improving economic relations with all States, particularly with developing countries. The comprehensive program, on the basis of which the integration of States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is being intensified, attaches the highest importance to enhancing the effectiveness of a planned international division of labor and an improvement in the structure of production and in monetary and commodity relations. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will continue to develop mutually advantageous economic co-operation with all countries that are interested in such co-operation and that provide the appropriate conditions. Promoting the development of international economic relations on a basis of equality, non-discrimination and mutual advantage is, we think, an important task for the United Nations.\n106.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, consistently following a policy of peace, approaches the General Assembly's work with a real desire to make as great and active a contribution as possible to efforts to strengthen international security and curb conflicts and aggression, and to efforts to develop constructive relations between States on the basis of the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced that the present-day international situation offers this General Assembly an opportunity to utilize all the resources at its disposal to strengthen and maintain the positive trends in the world. Our great common task and responsibility is to use these resources wisely, realistically and constructively.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first of all may I, on behalf of my Government and of my delegation, extend our felicitations to you on your being elected President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly? We would also like to associate ourselves with the tributes paid to you by the many distinguished speakers who have preceded me. Permit me also to express my delegation's appreciation of the exemplary manner in which your predecessor, the distinguished Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Adam Malik, presided over the twenty-sixth session last year.\n28.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to welcome our new Secretary-General. His ability, his wide knowledge of the ways of men and nations, and his fortitude will, I feel, be put to the severest test that any Secretary-General has yet undergone. This is because he is taking over an organization which is sick and enfeebled. The period between the last session and the present one has revealed in a striking fashion the Organization's weaknesses and failures in shaping and guiding the collective destiny of mankind.\n29.\tThe world witnessed during this period what could be described as the unkindest cut ever delivered to the United Nations. Great Powers and smaller nations discovered that complex and delicate international issues could be more expeditiously and satisfactorily settled outside this Organization through bilateral discussions rather than within it.\n30.\tThe first of these events was the resolution outside the United Nations of the seemingly irreconcilable differences which had existed between the United States and the People's Republic of China and which for a quarter of a century had been a source of international tensions and threats to peace. In the shape of the Taiwan issue it was for two decades debated inconclusively in the United Nations. Each debate left behind an accumulating residue of enmity and factionalism within the United Nations, which ensured that the next debate would be more sterile than the preceding one.\n31.\tBut now American-Chinese relations have been put on a more rational basis, not through the efforts of the United Nations, but in spite of them. Last year the President of the United States, following a series of bilateral discussions outside the United Nations, went to China and had direct talks with the Chinese leaders. At these talks both countries stated their areas of agreement and disagreement in language calculated to encourage further accord. This language was shom of all the polemics and posturing that had been depressing features of speeches and resolutions on the China issue in our Organization.\n32.\tThe second occasion when the United Nations was by-passed was the summit meeting between the President of the United States and the leaders of the Soviet Union. This resulted in a joint communique as well as a declaration of basic principles which stressed that\n\\\"Differences in ideology and in the social systems of the USA and the USSR are not obstacles to the bilateral development of normal relations.. .\\\".\nHere again what is worthy of note, apart from the reference to bilateral developments, is the tone of the speeches and declarations. They convey attitudes not of challenge and antagonism but of accommodation and conciliation.\n33.\tThe third instance of the by-passing of the United Nations was the signing of the Simla Agreement between the leaders of India and Pakistan. Here again what is noticeable in speeches and statements is the absence of polemics and antagonism.\n34.\tThe bilateral accord reached between the People's Republic of China and Japan in Peking on 29 September 1972 is yet another instance of differences being resolved independently of the United Nations.\n35.\tThe divided States of Korea and Germany are making progress towards rapprochement outside the framework of the United Nations. Another outstanding issue, the tragic and protracted conflict in Viet-Nam, given present indications, is more likely to be settled outside the United Nations than within it.\n36.\tThose instances of the by-passing of the United Nations have profound implications for our Organization. As far back as 1969 [1782nd meetingJ my delegation drew the attention of this Assembly to the separate decision-making network the big Powers were erecting to by-pass this Organization. What my delegation did not then foresee was that small nations too would by-pass the United Nations to resolve differences and conflicts. The Secretary- General is sufficiently struck by this development to draw our attention to it in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. He makes this appeal:\n\\\"... But when long-standing conflicts create vast humanitarian problems and may affect the peace and security of all mankind, the United Nations should surely be involved in the attempt to settle them.\\\" [A/87011 Add.l, p. 4. J\nIn saying that, the Secretary-General was not expressly referring to developments of the past year. However, he clearly had these developments in mind when making his observations. All these admittedly hopeful events occurred in contexts quite divorced from this Organization, its personnel, facilities, debates and resolutions.\n37.\tAll this is not to suggest that we should deplore settlements outside the framework of the United Nations. On the contrary, we should welcome any easing of tension and resolution of conflicts, however reached. The point I want to make is that, if the trends I have drawn attention to persist, then the United Nations could become a meaningless and irrelevant organization-no more than an international social club for wearisome rhetoric.\n38.\tIn this connexion I should like to draw the attention of representatives to Article 1 of the Charter, which proclaims that one of the purposes of the United Nations is \\\"to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends\\\".\n39.\tThe unpleasant fact we have to face is that after 27 years the United Nations is less and less a \\\"center\\\" for harmonizing the actions of nations. The time has therefore come for us to begin the unpleasant task of searching out the reasons for the growing lack of confidence in the efficacy of the United Nations and for its declining prestige.\n40.\tThere is, as in all great and complex problems, more than one cause. There are the external factors, such as the conviction of the big Powers that world diplomacy should be equated with big-Power diplomacy. The interests and ambitions of the big Powers cannot, they feel, be promoted and safeguarded by striving to get a consensus among some 130 Members, with interests and conflicts which the great Powers find not only irrelevant and tiresome but also increasingly dangerous to big-Power accord. It is not an accident that the drift towards an independent big-Power diplomacy began with the accelerated increase in the membership of the United Nations and with the tacit agreement that war between major Powers must be avoided at all costs because it implied mutual annihilation. Discussions and consultations with some 130 nations would not, the big Powers felt, promote their somewhat different interests. Big-Power problems could, it was felt, be more expeditiously and satisfactorily resolved in face-to-face discussions, unhampered by the importunities of a host of small nations. In so far as the major Powers show any interest in the United Nations, it is to regard it more as a forum for scoring propaganda points and to use smaller nations as pressure groups to influence their rivals. The United Nations, in other words, is for the big Powers a supplementary but subsidiary instrument of diplomacy. If they cannot resolve their problems through the United Nations, there ii always face-to-face diplomacy to fall back on.\n41.\tThe unpleasant fact that the small nations must face up to is that the great Powers do not need the United Nations for their diplomacy or the influencing of world affairs as much as small nations do. The big Powers have over the years established an international network of their own which, if the small nations are not careful, will increasingly shape the course of world events independently of the small nations. It is we, the small nations, rather than the great Powers, who stand to lose in the long run by the diminishing role assigned to the United Nations in the making of world history. The United Nations activities could, given present trends, be no more than foot-notes to the chapters the great Powers will write.\n42.\tWithout the United Nations there is no way in which the small nations can exert direct influence on the course of world history. In the early days of the United Nations, when the great Powers treated it as an important instrument of diplomacy, the smaller nations did play a not unimportant role in the shaping of international events. The aspirations and views of the third world nations did in some measure influence the policies and attitudes of the major Powers. The small nations were wooed with an ardor and a persistence which many small nations found satisfying. The great Powers valued, if not our views, at least our votes, because at that time, at the height of the cold war, they set great store by the resolutions approved in this Assembly. But now that the United Nations has been relegated to a position of relative unimportance by the great Powers we, the small nations, run the danger of being deprived of a very important instrument that we have for shaping and influencing major decisions on world affairs.\n43.\tIt is all too easy to cast the blame for the by-passing of the United Nations wholly on the selfishness and arrogance of the great Powers. They have their faults. Their wrangling and posturing to further the ends of the cold war undoubtedly contributed a great deal to the decline of the United Nations.\n44.\tBut the small nations, too, with their wrangling and posturing, have contributed as much to the decline of the world Organization; and if we, the small nations, want to restore vigor to the United Nations-as we must if we are to play any kind of role in world affairs then we must look at our shortcomings with a frank and critical eye. We must do so because not only is the United Nations being by-passed by the big Powers but it is also. as I have said, being by-passed by smaller nations. Like the big Powers, the small nations, too, are slowly veering to the view that the United Nations is not an organization which can be relied upon to resolve their conflicts, to solve their problems.\n45.\tOne reason is that the United Nations has tended over the years to become less and less an organization for reconciliation and more and more an arena for staging contests. That is reflected in the style and temper of many United Nations debates and resolutions. Instead of ad-dressing ourselves to finding practical solutions to difficult and complex problems we give ourselves over to polemics and rhetoric. The object is to whip up strong emotions, affix blame to one side or the other and compose resolutions around such all-too-familiar words as \\\"condemn\\\", \\\"deplore\\\", \\\"censure\\\" and \\\"expel\\\". This is not to deny the sincerity behind these great emotions or that the felt outrage is justified. Transgressions of principles basic to our Organization, such as forcible conquest and occupation of other peoples' territories or racial segregation and oppression, must clearly be condemned; nor can there be peaceful solutions to conflicts arising from such transgressions so long as the transgressors refuse to admit that basic principles have been breached.\n46.\tBut if the intention is conciliation, concession and problem-solving, then the polemical approach-the arena atmosphere will hardly accomplish any of these things. That is why earlier in my address I drew attention to the literary style of communiques and statements that preface successful bilateral discussions: they are invariably barren of polemics. Even when they testify to disagreement, they avoid apportioning blame. They see their problems and disagreements not in black-and-white but in shades of grey. The language of conciliation, of the problem-solver, has to be publicly expressed in shades of grey, whatever our perception of them may be in private.\n47.\tThat is not to say that we should not clearly enunciate our disagreements and the nature of our disagreements. But in situations of crisis and conflict, rhetoric and polemics, far from reducing tensions, make positions rigid, especially when uttered publicly to provoke and humiliate an adversary. Under these conditions, compromises and concessions become well-nigh impossible because, against the backdrop of polemics, concessions and compromises become humiliating defeats.\n48.\tThe situation is aggravated by the curious expectation in this Organization that countries not directly or even indirectly involved in a conflict should line up on one side or the other. This expectation is based on the premise that friends should prove their friendship by making enemies of their friend's enemies.\n49.\tThe consequence is that a conflict between two Members is, over a period of time, transformed into a generalized conflict involving many more Members of our Organization. The interested bystanders, instead of helping to resolve the conflict, themselves become contestants. That is one reason why many issues that come up before our Organization remain unresolved year after year. Where initially the parties to a dispute are few, it becomes unwieldy through the accretion of fresh partisans, resulting very often in everyone losing sight of the initial causes of the dispute.\n50.\tThis may explain why some of the issues that have haunted this Assembly for decades have been more satisfactorily resolved through direct negotiations between the original parties to the dispute. Presumably in bilateral discussions the initial causes of the dispute are recollected in relative tranquility.\n51.\tAnother reason for the success of bilateral discussions is that for the most part they take place in private. Unfortunately, most of the proceedings in the United Nations not only have the atmosphere of an arena, but they are also public. We perform not only for the home audience but for a world audience as well. We believe that what we say and do is being eagerly followed by the press, television and radio the world over. This may have been the case once, but it is my impression that in recent years the publicity media too have grown weary of us.\n52.\tThis is not to advocate that all proceedings of this Organization should be behind closed doors. However, this Organization should give serious consideration to supplementing public discussions with more private and closed- door discussions, especially in regard to issues of great delicacy involving profound emotions and what the Asians call \\\"face\\\". For example, my delegation would not object if the Security Council were to attempt to resolve sensitive problems without formal open sessions through informal consultations with interested parties. This is preferable to protracted meetings where no solutions are arrived at because sometimes the purpose of the Council is to decide who is innocent and who is guilty.\n53.\tThe gist of my plea is that the United Nations should become less of an arena for public contests and more of an Organization for smoothing out conflicts, for reconciling differences. The relative success of recent bilateral discussions holds an important lesson for our Organization. It is that we should inject into our Organization the spirit as well as the techniques successfully employed in bilateral negotiations. Such negotiations are private, they are informal; the participants go there not to decide who is guilty and who is innocent, but to reach accord while containing differences.\n54.\tI am not saying that this approach will resolve the many and difficult problems that confront our Organization. There are no simple and quick remedies to many of our problems. All I am saying is that, so long as most of us view the United Nations as an arena for dramatic contests, there is very little chance of our being able to restore to the United Nations the vigor and prestige which it deserves.\n55.\tMaybe it is not the United Nations which needs to be reinvigorated and nursed to health. It may well be that we have got the United Nations we deserve. For the United Nations has no existence outside of the Members that constitute it. The United Nations is no more than a mirror reflecting the collective weaknesses and defects of us all.\n56.\tOutside of us the United Nations is nothing. Without the United Nations we, the small nations, may be nothing too in the drama of world politics.\n"

        "file_text": "I extend to every delegation here and to the peoples of whom they are such worthy representatives the welcome of a Central American nation that wishes to live in peace with justice. Peace is born in the hot fire of freedom and is strengthened by democratic equality and the enlightenment of culture and it becomes stabilized through the equitable distribution of wealth. Justice should be founded on reason in evaluating the irrepressible evolution of peoples and respect for the rules of law, both in the relations of the State with man and in the coexistence of nations.\n258'. I am standing now on this lofty rostrum, which is a sounding board for world political thought, as the representative of the people and Government of the Republic of Honduras. On behalf of that people, of that Government and on my own behalf, I wish to convey my congratulations to Stanislaw Trepczyriski on his election to preside over the General Assembly at this current session, and I also congratulate this Assembly for having made such an unquestionably wise choice in his election.\n259.\tThe Republic of Honduras fits its activities into the framework of the rules governing the inter-American system. In order to be consistent in morality and in politics with the precepts of the United Nations, we must remain faithful to our regional institutions which, on the basis of our history and geography, we have created freely as a function of our sovereignty.\n260.\tWhat is permissible from the standpoint of regional groups is equally permissible from the universal standpoint. In the same way what is punishable within the regional area is also punishable at the international level. That is the criterion that the Republic of Honduras upholds as the rule for its international behavior.\n261.\tThe highest aspiration of all peoples is to live in peace with democracy. But it turns out that no word is used so much as the word \\\"democracy\\\" by large and small countries, strong and weak countries and free and oppressed countries. Everyone invokes it in the present, past and future. They all advocate it in good faith-and some even in bad faith. And this persistence proves at least that democracy as a political goal provides a system in which human coexistence and well-being are possible for a greater number of the members of society.\n262.\tWhatever may be the techniques and doctrine, it is obvious that a society is a democracy if it is made up of free men. Slavery among men and colonialism among nations are incompatible with the primary function of the Organization that was founded to promote peace and understanding among nations. The peace that is just and lasting is the peace which emanates from the consensus freely arrived at among men at the national level and the free consensus among nations at the international level.\n263.\tEconomic or political colonialism, with domination by the metropolitan country and partial or total submission on the part of the colonies, is nothing more than a manifestation of imperialism, intervention or conquest.\n264.\tMy country, as an active member of the in -national community, needs and wishes to express its views on certain matters of general interest which, as is the case with other States, affect us directly.\n265.\tAn item of the utmost interest is that which concerns world monetary policy. It is essential, in deference to strict justice, that the small countries should be heard and heeded when decisions are made about the world monetary system. Ideally there should be no privileged currencies. But this does not imply that we should overlook the reality which the world teaches us, that in the world some countries are leaders in economic and military matters; rather we should try to ensure that this leadership takes into account the rights to which, in justice and equity, all the nations of the world are equally entitled. What I have said is nothing more than a reaffirmation of a positive principle of international law such as the paragraph in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter which says that the peoples of the world, in adopting that Charter, reaffirm their \\\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small...\\\".\n266.\tFreedom to trade peacefully with any country in the world is the inherent right of any country, which no political or economic consideration should restrict. But freedom should be defended both by the developing countries as well as by those that have attained a larger measure of development.\n267.\tInternational trade presupposes a correlation between cause and effect within the international community. The practice of international trade should be conducted within the ambit of an exceedingly important task of the United Nations, which in this field should be to foster understanding and unity to stimulate and encourage production and progress the basis of well-being and harmony through mutual co-operation among the countries that are its members.\n268.\tWe are concerned about our domestic problems, but we are also interested in those which affect other areas of our planet the problems of the Middle East, and the Far East and we would hope that understanding and justice could open the way that will lead to solutions which can restore peace for the good of all peoples.\n269.\tHonduras considers it appropriate emphatically to affirm that it does not recognize, nor will it recognize, the acquisition of territories through the threat or use of force. Moreover, we also state with equal emphasis that we trust in the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations.\n270.\tWe are deeply concerned and upset by the recurring outbursts of terrorism which, with exceedingly varied and dramatic features, are seriously affecting many countries. Honduras condemns those passionate and violent forms of action. It considers that international co-operation is essential to eliminate such actions, and we feel that States should vigorously assume the obligation to defend the legal order in their respective jurisdictions and within the international community.\n271.\tIn the interests of the application of the principle of universality, we believe that all legally constituted peoples -always provided that they are States which accept and are ready to discharge their responsibilities as members of the international community should be admitted to membership in the United Nations.\n272.\tHonduras, which has always pursued a peaceful tradition in its international relations, expresses its hope that normality will return to the Central American region in the near future.\n273.\tThe solution of the problems which emerged from the armed conflict in which we found ourselves involved with a neighboring country today has reached a very advanced stage. In continuing talks in a calm and cordial atmosphere with representatives of the parties concerned, we are discussing appropriate formulas to reach an overall settlement, falling within the seven resolutions which emerged from the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting of the\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States on 27 October 1969, which provide a solution to all the existing differences, including the question of the determination and demarcation of the frontier between the two countries.\n274.\tWe believe that those portions of the frontier line on which we cannot reach agreement by direct settlement should be submitted to arbitration. Arbitration is an eminently legal tool, recognized in international law and universally accepted for the settlement of disputes between States. We American States have specifically proclaimed that principle in the Pact of Bogota.\n275.\tIn international law today the concept of frontiers is of significant importance. It no longer merely marks the limits of the jurisdiction of a State, but it has come to constitute a factor for rapprochement and economic and cultural development between nations. Clearly defined frontiers constitute a common good of the adjacent countries and that is why States should lend their cooperation to ensure the accurate definition of their frontiers and to resolve their territorial disputes by the means established under international law.\n276.\tDuring recent years and in statements made before this General Assembly, my country has reported on the negotiations in which my Government was engaged together with the Government of the United States of America, to gain recognition of Honduran sovereignty over the Swan Islands, which are also known as the Santanilla or Santillana Islands.\n277.\tToday I am gratified to be able to state that our dispute has been settled on pleasant terms. In the city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on 22 November 1971, the Government of Honduras and the Government of the United States of America signed a Treaty, article 1 of which provides that the Government of the United States of America recognizes Honduran sovereignty over the aforementioned Islands.\n278.\tThat treaty was approved by the legislative Powers of Honduras and of the United States of America, and once the necessary instrument of ratification was deposited in Washington, Honduras took over possession of those islands in a solemn and important ceremony held on 1 September of this year. In making this announcement, I should like to emphasize that the settlement of the aforementioned controversy is an irrefutable example of the fact that disputes between States can be solved within the broad rules of international law, when the parties to the dispute have the will to reach peaceful solutions and have an understanding of the meaning of peace and harmony between peoples and Governments. Honduras sincerely hopes that other countries that have similar disputes will be able to reach satisfactory solutions such as that which I have had the honor to describe to you today.\n279.\tHonduras attended the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea, convened in the Dominican Republic in June 1972, which was attended by representatives of countries which today are represented in this General Assembly, and on 9 June signed the Santo Domingo Declaration [A/8721, annex I, sect. 2]. That\u2003Declaration, which had in mind not only the present but also the future of peoples and which beyond question constitutes a new contribution to the evolution of the law of the sea proclaims principles which should certainly be carefully considered by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which is to be convened shortly.\n280.\tMy country was also a member of the United Nations Conference on the Human environment which met in Stockholm, Sweden, from 5 to 16 June of this year. My Government considers that if its results are to be given practical application with the urgency that is required and if we are to preserve the earth's resources for the benefit of present generations and as a vital legacy for future generations, an intergovernmental body should be established which would stimulate and guide international co-operation in the area of the human environment.\n281.\tMy comments on Central American economic integration deserve a separate paragraph in this statement. Honduras is sincerely devoted to integration. This is a historic truth and a present reality. But integration does not signify the total renunciation by a people of its territorial, political and economic personality. Integration does not mean resignation by a people to suffer permanent disadvantages. Integration means the establishment of business not only for the good of the producers, but rather for the good of the great consumer masses, which are the human foundation of nations. No, integration is the common effort of States, with clearly and permanently defined frontiers, to promote harmonious, accelerated and balanced development, to strengthen their democratic systems and to improve the social and economic conditions of their peoples.\n282.\tAll integration is and must be, in its origins and intentions, a common good. To integrate is to form a whole from parts which are separate but identified: \\\"to integrate\\\" means to search for and to apply complementary relationships; it means to organize, in harmony and justice, a superior economic unit as a result of the union.\n283.\tFor this reason, the notion or concept of economic integration implies the idea of mutual and balanced benefit. If that were not so the alleged integration would be distorted and the process would degenerate and become evil, so that it would lose its perspectives and its original ideals, and give way to the emergence of sordid interests which have greed as their common denominator.\n284.\tI have said all of this because the program of Central American economic integration has, at the present time, suffered a serious setback from which it cannot emerge until it has been subjected to a genuine and far-reaching restructuring which will reorganize its legal machinery, revise its postulates and establish goals which, in the last analysis, will be translated not merely in an increase of trade but also in benefits for all the classes that are participating in the generation of wealth in Central America.\n285.\tMr. President, the Republic of Honduras, its people and its Government repeat to you their warm and cordial welcome.\n"

        "file_text": "I am happy, Sir, to express to you the warm congratulations of the Ivory Coast delegation upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-seventh session.\n82.\tAt the same time I take great pleasure in expressing our gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, who presided with the authority and competence we all recognize here over the deliberations of the previous session of the General Assembly.\n83.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to repeat to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our warm congratulations on his appointment to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations. I should like to assure him that in the performance of his important and delicate task he can always count on the support and understanding of the Government of the Ivory Coast.\n84.\tThe last eight months have been marked by intensive activity in the most widely varied fields. If we cannot but deplore the absence of positive results, both in terms of development and in peace in regions of conflict, we are obliged to recognize, however, that a new wind has been blowing on the international political scene.\n85.\tThe journeys of President Nixon to the People's Republic of China, of President Bhutto to Simla, of Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka to Peking and of Chancellor Brandt to Moscow and East Germany are the most marked features of the change which has occurred in international relations. Similarly, the ratification of the Soviet-German and Polish-German agreements, the moves towards rapprochement between the two Koreas and the striking manifestation of reconciliation and solidarity which marked the ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in Rabat, show that a climate of international detente is reigning.\n86.\tThis climate of detente, which our Secretary-General quite rightly has described as \\\"a historical development of the highest importance\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 1], has been made possible because responsible men, like President Nixon and President Bhutto, Chancellor Brandt and distinguished Heads of State of Africa and Asia, have chosen, without inhibition, to have recourse to dialog in order to resolve delicate situations which seemed insoluble. The results achieved demonstrate once again that the policy of dialog, which engenders tolerance and understanding- understanding which facilitates coexistence, the last stage of the process of exchange which is a true golden rule for a world which wishes to survive-remains the most effective, the most humane and the most reasonable method of resolving differences.\n87.\tIn his message to the nation on 7 August last, the Head of State of the Ivory Coast, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, stated:\n\\\"One of these hopes and you are aware, my dear friends, how much I cherish it-is that of seeing dialog, something which the Ivory Coast has always indefatigably championed, becoming finally the uncontested and general rule in our world, so that in order to prevent and to resolve conflicts of all kinds, hate, fanaticism and blind violence can give way to a spirit of co-operation which would be sincere and very widely shared.\\\"\nBut Heaven knows the extent to which fanaticism and violence have given us, and alas are still giving us, distressing examples of their pernicious effects.\n88.\tOn the world chess-board the Middle East has become an important piece in the fluctuating, equivocal and doubtful policy' of the Member States, in particular the great Powers. The extremes of yesterday no longer exist, but the situation remains dangerous and explosive. For more than 20 years, at each of our sessions, the parties to this conflict have been vetting and scrutinizing our slightest gestures and every word we utter. Our Assembly is finally awake to the mass of innocent deaths resulting from acts of violence and repression, which are tragic episodes in a strategic war which reminds us if there is any need of this-of the existence and the persistence of a kind of slow-motion war. Our reaction is then to vote for one more resolution, with the easy conscience of a good craftsman doing a good job. But the reality is painful; it is no piece of fiction. We are plunged into a tragic atmosphere resulting from a refusal to undertake dialog. And thus the time has come when the disappearance of hope leaves us nothing more than shattered dreams and impotent resentments. Yes, indeed, the time has come when men, feeling themselves abandoned, isolated, betrayed and hunted, have no further recourse but irrational violence.\n89.\tWe must recognize that in this tragedy the conduct of the United Nations has been far from being exemplary. Now, things happen quickly and politics tolerates only success. Are we to continue to display such an extreme of impotence? We do not think so. We believe that we must seek to determine the causes of our failure in order to bear them in mind when advocating more realistic approaches to the problems of this region, whose essential elements are the occupied territories, the refugees and the state of belligerence. Solutions are possible if we make up our minds to rid ourselves of our prejudices, if we bridle our passions and if we place above our own interests those of the peoples concerned. The memorandum of the 10 African statesmen,  prepared to contribute to the solution of the problem and based upon the principles I have just mentioned, has been totally disregarded, and we can only regret this.\n90.\tWe are particularly saddened by this tragic situation. We think that peace is possible by a recourse to dialog.\nSince 1963 the Ivory Coast has been advocating this in the Special Political Committee. My country believes that this earth, where man has given his life for other men, his brothers, is not doomed to hatred, war and carnage, but that, on the contrary, its destiny is to become a place of reconciliation, peace, love and fraternity.\n91.\tSecurity Council resolution 309 (1972), charged the Secretary-General with a mission to contact with South Africa. This contact, the dialog for which the Ivory Coast cherishes a veritable passion through loyalty to the cause of its struggling brothers of southern Africa, which it knows to be just, constitutes a new approach in the search for a solution to the problem of Namibia.\n92.\tThe success of this undertaking, which would finally afford us a glimpse of the dawning of an era of fraternity and understanding among black and white Africans, depends upon the abandonment of the idea of the partition of Namibia into small nations, which simply should be thought of as one of the minor and outmoded stratagems of the colonial power of yesterday.\n93.\tThe mission of the Secretary-General constitutes, in this context, the test of the goodwill of the Government of South Africa. We therefore await with interest the report of the Secretary-General, and we presume that the South African Government is undoubtedly aware of the grave consequences of a failure of this mission. For our part, let us display the greatest goodwill. Let us be patient, let us exhaust all the possibilities offered by this approach before any rupture takes place. What is at stake for Africa is of the most vital importance.\n94.\tIn southern Africa the situation therefore remains extremely disturbing. The majority of the people of Zimbabwe has rejected the Douglas-Home/Ian Smith agreement of November 1971,  and hence no progress has been achieved. The illegal regime profited from an easing of sanctions and noted with satisfaction the official lifting of the embargo on certain strategic supplies. Here again we are faced with a situation which is only too familiar, that of the ineffectiveness of sanctions, which are never applied because they are thwarted by the narrow, selfish interests of States.\n95.\tAt the meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa the African group insisted that the administering Power should convene a constitutional conference to lay the bases for a settlement of the situation and a transfer of power to the majority.\n96.\tWe consider that, after the veto \\\"cast by the United Kingdom at the Security Council's 1666th meeting, the General Assembly should deal with this item at this session and exert pressure upon that Government to take the measures necessary to remedy the illegal and dangerous situation prevailing in the Territory bearing in mind the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Zimbabwe.\n97.\tAs for the African Territories under Portuguese domination, their destinies are dear. The colonial war being waged against them is only a distressing phase. The Portuguese army is fighting the inevitable. Those Territories will be independent. It is simply a matter of the inexorable course of history and the unshakable and invincible will of their peoples, a will manifested in the actions of the nationalists.\n98.\tIn order to preserve its African image, like other former colonial Powers Portugal has no alternative but a fruitful dialog with the nationalists. If it refuses and persists in propagating the fiction of \\\"Portuguese overseas provinces\\\", it will know the solitude of those who sow death and then undergo irreparable disaster on our continent.\n99.\tWe have asserted from this very rostrum that Portugal's future in Africa is tied to its recognition of the right of all Africans to independence. The problem is simple and has one solution the independence of these Territories in friendship with the former colonial Power. If it rejects that, it thus rejects any prospect of having any future in Africa.\n100.\tThe Ivory Coast's policy is to contribute to creating an atmosphere that would make it possible for the administering Power to get a better insight into the realities of today's Africa, an Africa aspiring to its own identity.\n101.\tIn Viet-Nam, the situation seems to be frozen. Men, women and children by the thousands are falling victims to the principles of those who are supposed to guide their destinies. The main victims are the masses of the dead, the wounded, the mutilated, and the families in mourning. The principal victors are the armaments industries of the various countries supplying arms. The halting of hostilities and subsequent self-determination and neutrality seem to be the necessary pre-conditions for a final settlement of the VietNamese situation if we want to end the terrifying spectacle of dual intransigence causing so much havoc in the Far East.\n102.\tIt is because we believe in the virtues of dialog in settling problems and the most difficult of situations that we hope positive results will be forthcoming from the secret conversations now going on simultaneously with the interminable Paris conference.\n103.\tTen years have elapsed since the first Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. One meeting after another is held, and the examination of the budgets devoted to arms unfortunately indicates that the target of general and complete disarmament belongs only to the very distant future.\n104.\tHowever, partial progress has been achieved in this last decade, and it should be credited to our Organization. This initial progress can open up prospects of fruitful debate which will make it possible to reach general agreements within the framework of a world conference on disarmament. We consider these agreements to be indispensable if we want once and for all to banish the specter of war and give human beings enough time to devote themselves to the magnificent task of human solidarity.\n105.\tThe first United Nations Development Decade is dead. The Second United Nations Development Decade, hardly born, is already in its death throes. We prepared for the great conference in Santiago, Chile.  We took an active part in it, and our final disappointment was commensurate with the hopes we had cherished for it, hopes so cruelly dashed.\n106.\tThe gap between the rich and the poor is growing endlessly. \\\"Assistance\\\", this formula associating the words \\\"give\\\" and \\\"receive\\\", has been substituted for the genuine co-operation that should have been established between nations. This assistance is inadequate, and the rich countries providing it cannot increase it because of opposition from their own citizens. Indeed, the taxpayers involved are less and less willing to have their precious money, as they see it, going to fill the coffers of States they cannot even find on the map of the world. But we, the poor nations, know that our salvation lies, not in the policy of the outstretched hand, which is repugnant to our dignity, but in just and equitable remuneration for our primary commodities, the fruit of our own labors.\n107.\tMeeting here are the rich and poor countries constituting the United Nations. We have a more accurate view of matters. We are not unaware that primary commodities, be they mineral or agricultural, are the\\\" principal and sometimes the only resources of developing countries and that a decline in terms of trade is inevitably to the detriment of those commodities.\n108.\tThe loss sustained by the countries of the third world has been estimated at $1,300 million annually for the period 1965-1967. Today, in spite of UNCTAD that figure amounts to between $3,000 million and $4,000 million.\n109.\tThe import taxes levied by industrialized countries on primary commodities coming from developing countries contribute-sometimes substantially-to the budgetary resources of the rich countries. It is quite clear that the countries that profit so much from international trade are hardly likely to question existing machinery.\n110.\tWhen, in August 1971, a crisis broke out in the international monetary system, the problem of the development of the poor countries became a secondary matter. The rich countries, and in particular the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, found it too easy to conclude that they were the only countries concerned in the crisis and did not even think about its grave repercussions for the countries of the third world. Nor do they think about them now.\n111.\tThat was noted with some bitterness by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, who on 23 December 1971 stated:\n.. development of the 'third world' [has become relegated] to that of being a casual by-product of output and demand in the industrialized countries.\\\"\n112.\tMeeting in Santiago, Chile, in the spring of this year, the third session of UNCTAD did nothing to repudiate that assertion. In analyzing the disappointing conclusions of that session, President Houphouet-Boigny quite rightly wondered:\n\\\"Who would dare to express satisfaction at the results of the third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which has once again seen the expression of the impotence of the poor and the lack of conscience of the rich. As for the most essential problem, that of primary commodities, it was in fact not really faced and was subsumed in the recommendations to the World Bank, which, we fear, in this matter as indeed in others, will simply be added to the interminable list of wishes which are as pious as they are innumerable.\\\"\n113.\tI shall conclude by stating that it was most illusory to expect any results from that session: in fact, the intransigence and insensitivity of the affluent countries are equaled only by the arrogance of their wealth in the face of the demoralizing impotence of the poor countries.\n114.\tThat is the situation at a time when our Organization wants to achieve the objectives of the Second Development Decade.\n115.\tHowever, the financial resources made available up to now to the third world by the rich countries represent only half of what had been provided for, while at the same time the servicing of the debt of the poor countries has increased more than twice as fast as the export resources which were to finance that servicing. This tragic situation has led distinguished economists to raise objectively a question which should be of concern to us, \\\"Who is helping whom? \\\"\n116.\tHowever, and without any real reason, we are searching the dark skies for some chances of success for this Decade. Those chances might be transformed into reality if the affluent countries were willing courageously and honestly to reflect in actions their goodwill that is to say, if they were to set in motion a policy of co-operation on a world scale which would permit, inter alia, the stabilization of commodity prices and the development and universalization of a system of preferences without reciprocity or discrimination, to abolish in their own countries restrictions on manufactured articles exported from developing countries, and gradually to transform the codes which at present govern shipping.\n117.\tBut those chances would become certainties if the poor countries, heeding the logic of facts, were finally to realize the imperatives of the situation, which make it necessary for them to put an end to their sterile competition and try to form themselves into groups of primary commodity producing countries in order to acquire the weight and the necessary influence and importance to discuss the points at issue on an equal footing with the consumer countries.\n118.\tOur countries were not born to independence in order to die of it. Our countries were able to put up a magnificent fight for political independence, and surely they can do so in the struggle for their economic well-being. They do possess resources of energy, courage and determination, which can work miracles when put to the test.\n119.\tOnly progress based on the efforts on the part of all, rich and poor, will give to all the peoples of the world reason to believe in peace and in the reality of a better life on our human planet.\n120.\tAs for the problem of the environment, the philosophy of the Ivory Coast in this regard is that of most developing countries. We therefore give priority to development rather than to the protection of the environment as the rich countries conceive of it. In Stockholm,  in the name of ecology, we were shown a picture of the future which would not be so splendid: pollution. But what pollution is there that is more dangerous, more destructive of civilization, than that of poverty, misery, disease, lack of hygiene and ignorance? However, those are so many scourges, and men of goodwill in their altruistic campaigns are meeting with refusals on the part of the affluent countries to do anything-about the cycles of production and well-being, for the benefit of everyone. For us, indeed, an improvement in our standard of living is inherent in human nature and its measurable reality remains our principal target; The Government of the Republic of the Ivory Coast thinks that a more profound knowledge of the environment should in fact be a concern of life and that the environment should be dealt with in the light of its human goals and targets. That is why we should not, in our view, contemplate this matter only from its biological, technological or scientific standpoint. We should study it as the problem of life, embracing all of life's aspects, political, cultural, economic, social. In this way we should have a clear and global insight into the ecological and social imbalance, a source of inequity, alienation and anti-social conduct.\n121.\tOur Organization has the essential task of bringing about peace, and the health of the world. The international relaxation of tension which has now been observed should not lead to. a relaxation of vigilance. We fear that the position adopted by certain States in the budgetary area will lead to new difficulties, and may cause a new financial crisis, such as we have already witnessed, with the risk of paralyzing once again the functioning of the United Nations.\n122.\tIn spite of the criticisms which various people may have had and may still have with regard to the functioning of our Organization we are all aware that it does have the extraordinary merit of existing. Its importance in the solution of social, cultural and economic problems existing in the world should not be underestimated. Its shortcomings are essentially political.\n123.\tThe Organization still remains the best long-term chance which the international community has to ensure its survival and justice and progress, with the effective participation of all nations. It remains noble in its task of active solidarity and generous in the granting of its aid and it would stand to gain a great deal by remaining pure in its political activities.\n124.\tBefore leaving this rostrum I should like to assert once again the attachment of the Republic of the Ivory\nCoast to the United Nations, to its Charter and its principles, and also the absolute belief that we in the Ivory Coast have in its future, because whatever the multiplicity of our convictions there remains one cause to be defended: peace.\n"

We are happy at your nomination not only because of the skill with which you are conducting our deliberations but also because you represent the Polish People's Republic, linked as it is to Cuba by close ties of friendship and fraternal co-operation.\n22.\tThe general debate is now drawing to an end. Each year it helps to show up the grave problems confronting our peoples. From the general debate with overwhelming accuracy, we realize that the world is still confronted by the same situations as at previous sessions; that the most acute problems of the moment are still awaiting solution; that peoples still continue their indefatigable efforts to create a world based on independence, on full respect for national rights, on the eradication of social injustice and on the achievement of progress for all.\n23.\tHowever, the yearly statement of those problems and their constant stigmatizing has served little purpose. The repeated efforts made here to ensure full respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter have led to but meager results. The efforts of the majority of the Members of the Organization to establish a new international order based on the principles that underlay the creation of the United Nations have come up against the attitude of the imperialist and colonialist Powers, which try by all means to perpetuate their exploitation of other peoples, to despoil them of their wealth and impose their will upon them.\n24.\tIn Indo-China, in the Middle East, in Africa and in Latin America we see taking place a unique process of open warfare without quarter between the emerging peoples and the reactionary forces which are obstinately determined to halt the inexorable march of history.\n25.\tThe aggression against Viet-Nam is still the main international problem. The crimes committed by the United States Government go beyond the limits of human imagination and beggar Nazi barbarism. The Yankees have directed against the people of Viet-Nam all the resources of a technology which serves infamy and their plans for universal enslavement and domination. The bombing of dikes and irrigation systems, the indiscriminate destruction of VietNamese towns and villages, the mining and blockading of ports of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, the mass use of toxic chemical substances-all these call for the most resolute and outraged condemnation by all peoples. The Government of Mr. Nixon is guilty of the most monstrous crimes. Civilized conscience and history have both condemned him for genocide, biocide and ecocide and call upon the international community to take energetic action to put an end to Yankee brutality, to clip the claws of the Pentagon, and to assure the VietNamese people of their sacred right to independence and to decide on their future.\n26.\tThere is no other solution to the problem of Viet-Nam than acceptance of the seven-point program submitted by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam. That program enjoys the support of international public opinion, which was made clear at the recent Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Georgetown, Guyana, from 8 to 12 August 1972. The Conference demanded the immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of all North American troops, military personnel and war equipment from Viet-Nam and the cessation of intervention in that country, and called upon the North American Government to take part seriously in the Paris talks and to give a favorable response to the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam and of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. By admitting as a full-fledged member the Provisional Revolutionary Government, the Conference evidenced its commitment of solidarity with the heroic struggle of the VietNamese people and once more affirmed that that struggle has earned the admiration and support of all peoples. In that way the countries meeting in Guyana made it clear, moreover, that the incomparable stubbornness of the Viet-Namese people which has culminated in their memorable victory over Yankee brutality constitutes, the greatest contribution to the cause of the emancipation of all countries of the so-called third world.\n27.\tHence, all peoples of the world joyously greet the successful achievements of the Viet-Namese fighters and hail like a personal triumph the defeat of the Yankee policy in South Viet-Nam and in all Indo-China. North American imperialism has been thoroughly defeated in its filthy war of aggression. In its insane arrogance, however, Washington goes on seeking to increase the sacrifices called for from that indomitable people. Aware that there is no alternative for them but that of total withdrawal from Viet-Nam, the Yankees are leveling everything, eradicating from the land of Viet-Nam even the last trace of life; they travel all the roads of infamy towards their diabolical aim of annihilating the people that beat them to their knees and wrecked their plans for domination. Some day all mankind will sit as a unanimous Nuremberg Tribunal in judgment on those who have thus befouled the human spirit.\n28.\tIndignantly, therefore, we listen to the lying allegations of the head of the North American delegation, It is the last straw to have the United States try to place the responsibility for the continuation of the war on the Viet-Namese side. The United States Government never had any reason whatsoever to interfere in the affairs of Viet-Nam; it never had and never will have any right to interfere in the life of that people or of any other. The world is no longer so easily hoodwinked. It knows perfectly well that if an end is to be put to the conflict, the United States must withdraw from Viet-Nam completely and give, up its dreams of imposing the Thieu administration, the creation of Yankee intervention, on the Viet-Namese. What is difficult to understand is why Mr. Rogers comes to this rostrum to repeat arguments that absolutely no one believes.\n29.\tTo restore peace to IndoChina there must also be an end to the North American aggression in Cambodia and Laos. The solution of the conflicts in both those countries can only be possible with the acceptance of the political program of the National United Front of Kampuchea and the program of the Laotian Patriotic Front. The non-aligned countries also took a position of solidarity with the Cambodian and Laotian peoples in their struggle against imperialist aggression. The recognition of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the sole and legitimate representative of that country within the non-aligned movement constitutes yet another proof of the growing co-ordination among the anti-imperialist forces of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and a further proof of the bankruptcy of North American policy. With the restoration of its seat to the legal Government of Cambodia, the non-aligned countries not only performed an act of historic justice and confirmed their adherence to the anti-imperialist principles which gave rise to that movement, but also and at the same time recognized a fact that cannot be disregarded: the Lon Nol clique barely holding out in the Cambodian capital, kept going solely by foreign invaders represents nobody and is the deceptive shadow of a fugitive nightmare. The General Assembly must draw the conclusions \nfrom all this: it must drive out the usurpers and restore its seat to the legitimate representatives of Cambodia.\n30.\tThe Korean peninsula continues to be a source of tension in the Far East. It is indeed deplorable that once again North American intrigue has succeeded and that it has not been possible to include in our agenda the item regarding the creation of favorable conditions for the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea. Cuba reaffirms its position of principle in this matter: the Assembly must insist upon the immediate withdrawal of all North American troops from South Korea, the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea, and the cessation of all interference in the internal affairs of that country.\n31.\tA grave situation generating tensions and threats still exists in the Middle East. The Cuban position on this matter is very well known. Only the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from territories which they have occupied since June 1967, together with full respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, can possibly restore peace in that area.\n32.\tNo one can turn a blind eye to the constant provocation and hostile acts of every nature constantly being perpetrated against the People's Democratic Republic, of Yemen. This conduct is encouraged by imperialist interests, particularly North American imperialism, and by 'die feudal circles in the area, afraid as they are that the example of the Yemeni revolution might encourage the Arab masses to try to set up truly revolutionary and popular regimes.\n33.\tThe European continent, the breeding-ground of conflicts and of antagonisms throughout history, today offers a promise of peaceful coexistence. That encouraging prospect is the result of the policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and of their tenacious efforts for peace and international security and the establishment of relations of co-operation among the States of the region. Cuba supports the initiative of the socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, for the holding of a conference on European security and co-operation.\n34.\tThe normalization of relations in Europe and the overcoming of tensions inherited from the last war all call for full recognition of the German Democratic Republic, a sovereign State that is destined to play an outstanding role in the world of today. For the sake of the welfare of all and the cause of international peace, an end must be put to the discrimination against socialist Germany. The admission of that State to the United Nations, and to all other international organizations, is an urgent and necessary measure which brooks no delay.\n35.\tOn the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly there are a number of items which touch upon the strengthening of international peace and security. Cuba reaffirms its support for the holding of a world disarmament conference open to participation by all States. We owe the Soviet Union a debt of gratitude for having taken this initiative as well as for its initiative with regard to the question dealing with the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the use of force in international relations.\n36.\tAmong the basic problems also to be included in the agenda is that of the elimination of military bases set up by imperialism all over the world, that are so many spearheads of its policy of expansion, subversion, domination and aggression. As Latin American examples I refer you to those set up in Panama, Puerto Rico and the naval base of Guantanamo in Cuba.\n37.\tCuba shares the deep interest of all nations in peace, and thus we support any measure this Organization may adopt leading to general and complete disarmament, the destruction of all nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them, the liquidation of all existing arsenals and the cessation of the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons. But in so doing we must draw attention to the fact that these efforts will meet with mighty obstacles as long as the policies of imperialist aggression and exploitation survive in the world. The peaceful endeavors of the United Nations will only be crowned with success when conditions are such that security, independence and the territorial integrity of all States, great or small, are guaranteed; and this can be possible only through the overthrow of the aggressive plans and purposes of imperialism.\n38.\tThe retrograde interests of colonialism still stand in the way of the achievement of the Declaration contained in resolution 1514 (XV). In Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde, m Angola and in Mozambique, the Portuguese colonialists, armed and supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and with international mercenaries, pirates and bandits, ruthlessly put down or fight against the liberation movements. Yet the latter respond daily with more overwhelming blows against their oppressors. The people and the Government of the Republic of Guinea are constantly on the alert, ready to turn back and put down imperialist aggressions. The masses in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa are putting up resolute resistance against Fascist colonialists. Threats and plots by the imperialists continue against the Republic of Guinea, the People's Republic of the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. The people of Puerto Rico too, encouraged by the recent decisions of international support for their just cause, are widening their struggle against North American colonial domination.\n39.\tBy the expressed will of the vast majority of its Members, the United Nations has defined its unequivocal support fur the right of all colonial peoples to independence. Year after year, from this rostrum, the Organization constantly condemns colonialism and resolutions are adopted reiterating the need to put an end, once and for all, to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.\n40.\tAnd yet, the decolonizing work of our Organization faces resistance, stubbornness and obstacles well known to all. In the last few years the alliance of the reactionary forces of colonialism and racism and imperialism has been tightened in order to stem the process of the emancipation of the subject peoples, to reduce the United Nations to impotence and to perpetuate the slavery imposed for centuries over a considerable part of mankind. The fight against colonialism has thus reached a critical stage. The General Assembly must now consider concrete measures to ensure fulfillment of its decisions in all those Territories that have yet to achieve their independence. It is now up to the General Assembly to adopt the decisions necessary to break the back of colonialist-imperialist resistance and guarantee to all peoples the exercise of their indisputable right to national independence.\n41.\tAction by all socialist and non-aligned States must be concerted in order to overcome the fatal influence still exerted by North American imperialism and its reactionary customers. Only thus can the United Nations start along the road of effective and decisive assistance to the peoples fighting for their emancipation.\n42.\tThe Georgetown Conference defined the joint pro-gramme of the non-aligned nations for the complete and final eradication of colonialism, and very clearly set forth the reason why this disgraceful vestige of the past still survives in much of the African continent. That reason is none other than the political and diplomatic support, the financial and military backing which colonialism and racism receive from the main centers of capitalist power in the world, and particularly from North American imperialism. It is the weapons of NATO that shoot at African fighters. It is the Western monopolies, primarily Yankee ones, which exploit the natural resources of the colonies and swell their bank deposits with the blood and sweat of the enslaved masses. It is the pressures and maneuvers of the Western Powers which hamstring action by the United Nations in favor of the oppressed peoples.\n43.\tFor nations with an anti-colonialist mission, which constitute the great majority of this Assembly, the choice could not be simpler: either they yield to imperialist pressure and slow down the process of liberation, or they attack more vigorously so as to isolate and overthrow the imperialists and put an end to colonialism everywhere.\n44.\tThere is no other choice but to redouble our militant solidarity with all national liberation movements and give them all the political and material assistance they require to see their struggle culminate in victory. For us, enemies as we are of colonialism, the liberation movements are the rightful rulers of the colonial territories; it is they who have the sole right to assume international legal representation of their peoples, it is they who comply with the terms of the Charter and United Nations declarations, and it is they who deserve the full support of this Organization.\n45.\tMy delegation is gratified at the recent decisions taken with regard to the Portuguese colonies and Puerto Rico by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples because they reflect the determination of that important organ fully to implement the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly and to ensure the emancipation of all those Territories which have not yet achieved their independence.\n46.\tWe also rejoice at the important decision of the Georgetown Conference to give seats as observers at future meetings of the non-aligned nations to national liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU], League of Arab States, and the Socialist Party of Puerto Rico.\n47.\tWe are entirely in agreement with the decision taken by the Fourth Committee at its 1975th meeting last 27 September to invite as observers the representatives of liberation movements. Cuba considers that representatives of all the subjugated Territories should participate in the work of this Assembly, both in the committees and at the plenary meetings, when items dealing with colonialism, including item 23, are being discussed. No one can challenge the authority of the spokesmen of the combatant peoples to take part in decisions touching on their own future.\n48.\tThe Special Committee resolution recognizing the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self- determination and independence and instructing its working group to undertake a study of the specific steps required to implement the Declaration in resolution 1514 (XV) regarding that Territory [see A/8723/Rev.lt chap. I, para. 85J constitutes an overwhelming and crucial victory for the universal cause of the campaign against colonialism. For 20 years North American imperialism barred the doors of this Organization to the case of Puerto Rico. To maintain that situation, the United States Government resorted to all kinds of pressures, maneuvers and ruses. For 20 years it imposed on this Organization a silence of complicity permitting brutally to stifle the liberating decisions of the Puerto Rican people. For 20 years the United States stood in the way of the fulfillment by the United Nations of its duty regarding Puerto Rico, spurned each and every one of the anti-colonialist decisions adopted here, deceived world opinion, and acted out the grotesque farce entitled \\\"Associated Free State\\\" which the racist regime of South Africa is now borrowing to introduce in the Territories which it usurped and now oppresses and plunders. To do this, the United States violated the sovereignty of some Member States, terrified the fearful, broke the resistance of the weak and bent the will of the timorous. Today it still continues its wretched behavior. It still tries to snatch their victory from the hands of the Puerto Rican people.\n49.\tCuba is confident that this Assembly will approve the report of the Special Committee [Al8723jRev.l] and thereby authorize it next year to adopt and implement decisions regarding Puerto Rico. Few peoples in the world have earned such a clear-cut right to international solidarity as the people of Puerto Rico. In an unequal contest with an incomparably more powerful enemy, kept isolated from the general movement which led to American independence, the prey of all the furies of empire, the Puerto Rican people, the Boricuas, never yielded to their colonizers' assaults. Puerto Ricans offered this continent the longest gaoled political prisoners: Oscar Collazo, Lolita Lebron, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, Irving Flores, Bernardo Diaz Diaz, Juan Antonio Cruz Colon, Rafael Molina Centeno and Manuel Mendez Candia. Prisoners for over two decades, they are the living symbols of the unbreakable rebellion of that people. For keeping intact the spirit of their struggle, those nine patriots remain incommunicado, subject to all sorts of harassment, the victims of a hateful penal system. Among them there are some of great age, others whose health is precarious. We cannot delay the mobilization of all anti-colonialist forces to demand urgently from the North American Government the immediate liberation of those fighters, who sacrificed themselves for the ideals of independence long before this Organization proclaimed them. We must not allow the hatred of the colonialists to be vented.again on nine heroes who, with unparalleled courage, fought to defend their country's right to independence. Their imprisonment is a disgrace to the anti-colonialist principles so solemnly proclaimed by this Assembly.\n50.\tPuerto Rico, a Latin American nation which is an inseparable part of our common country, will one day be independent. The last of the Latin American nations to be held under the colonial yoke, subjected to more intense exploitation by the monopolies than any other, made a military fortress of imperialism, subjected to the most execrable techniques of oppression, threatened with total absorption: Puerto Rico and its cause deserve the widest and most generous support.\n51.\tWhile seeking support, the Puerto Rican people continues its struggle, continues its unflagging pilgrimage towards independence. It has covered a long road since the day when Bayoan, the Indian of the first endeavours, discovered that the white man was not immortal. It will continue along that road until it is able to prove that Yankee imperialism is also not invincible.\n52- Assistance for the independence of Puerto Rico was a key part of the liberating strategy of Simon Bolivar and a constant theme in the teachings of Jose Marti. For any self-respecting Latin American it is still a duty not to be shirked. Cuba for one will continue unhesitatingly to do its duty, both within and outside this Organization.\n53.\tCuba and Puerto Rico were merged by history in a single destiny. A century of lonely fighting together under twin flags sealed the single commitment that would link them for ever. In 1893 Jose Marti defined this union as follows:\n\\\"In the days to come those of Ponce and San Juan will fall in Yara and the Guasimas, and those of Cuba will fall for Puerto Rico.\\\"\n54.\tAntagonism between peoples and their oppressors in Asia, Africa and Latin America has reached its most crucial moment. From that struggle will emerge the world of the future, which is already dawning in the socialist countries today, free from exploitation and exploiters. To achieve liberation and to secure their rights the peoples must confront reactionary violence-sometimes brutal, sometimes subtle, but always cruel. Thus to say the least it is unheard of that an item on terrorism should be suggested for inclusion in the agenda, as though that phenomenon did not have very clearly defined roots, as though \\\"its causes were not known to all, as though violence in the world today were a geometrical abstraction with neither explanation nor content. Cuba has already made known its views regarding this unacceptable maneuver and in due course will continue to fight against both it and any other stratagem used in this Organization to combat the revolutionary movements.\n55.\tInternational attention is focused increasingly on Latin America. We are living through decisive moments; we are shaken to the very costs by the liberating current that travels through our shaken geography with increasing speed. But we also confront threats and dangers which must keep us constantly alert.\n56.\tThe heroic and tenacious efforts made by our people to consolidate our independence and exercise self- determination in different ways call for and deserve the solidarity of all the peoples of the world.\n57.\tFraternally we greet and support the Chilean people and the Government of Popular Unity which, under the direction of President Salvador Allende, is resolutely addressing itself to the acts of intervention, pressure, intrigue, sabotage, reprisal and threats from North American imperialism, whose latest act was the arbitrary embargo on a shipment of copper decreed by a French court on the shameless insistence of the Yankee monopoly, Braden Kennecott, which itself has for years siphoned off the fruits of the sweat and sacrifice of the Chilean workers. That criminal economic aggression is a shameful violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the most elementary tenets of international law. We must protest most energetically against this disgraceful affront by Yankee imperialism, trying by most unscrupulous means to undermine and curtail self-determination and the economic development of Chile and other under-developed countries.\n58.\tCuba welcomes and supports, with fraternal identification, the Peruvian people and the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Force and its President General Juan Velazco Alvarado, who continue with determination along the difficult road towards full recovery of national sovereignty, to regain the wealth of the country and to operate the economic and social transformations that will create the conditions and bases for a new life that will benefit the great majority of its peoples which for centuries had been dispossessed and exploited. My delegation is proud to proclaim that the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and Peru and the increasing strengthening of the ties of friendship and co-operation between our two peoples and Governments are a milestone in the process of Latin American liberation, independence, unity and progress.\n59.\tWe are equally at one with and welcome the unceasing struggle of the people and the Government of Panama in their claim to sovereign rights over the Canal Zone and in defense of their territorial integrity.\n60.\tHie events taking place in those three countries are an unequivocal symptom of the fact that Latin America is no longer prepared to submit to the shackles of subordination or oppression by foreigners.\n61.\tI do not believe it vain to stress again that the position of Cuba regarding North American imperialism and its puppets in Latin America and the Organization of American States [OAS] is and will remain firm and unchanging. We say again that we have nothing to negotiate or discuss with the Government of the United States. We demand and do not discuss-the withdrawal of the United States from the naval base in Guantanamo. We demand an end to the blockade and to subversive action. But as the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government Commander Fidel Castro has stated again and again, apart from these unshakable demands, Cuba, can never talk with the Yankee\nGovernment until the latter gives up its self-appointed role of so-called policeman of Latin America, and until it puts an end to its criminal aggression against the people of Viet-Nam.\n62.\tOnce again we reaffirm that Cuba is ready to renew or establish diplomatic relations only with those countries of Latin America that are truly independent and sovereign and that fight to reconquer their national rights, such as Chile and Peru, which, despite the shameful efforts of the North American Government, have assumed that initiative precisely in the exercise of their independence and sovereignty. Once and for all, we state that Cuba will never return to the OAS, a discredited instrument of the North American domination over Latin America. In a word, Cuba will never undertake negotiations of any nature at the cost of its principles.\n63.\tThe international community must condemn the imperialist maneuvers and efforts to interfere in the decisions adopted or to be adopted by Latin American peoples in full exercise of their sovereignty and in order to meet their legitimate national aspirations. The activities of the North American copper companies, whose holdings were nationalized by the Chilean Government, on organizing economic reprisals against that country, are inadmissible acts of aggression against a developing country that call for the most vigorous repudiation from the Assembly.\n64.\tOn this point I should like to read two paragraphs of the Georgetown Declaration. That Declaration was approved by 58 foreign ministers of non-aligned countries on\n11\tAugust of this year:\n\\\"The Conference examined the situation in Latin America and expressed full support of the Chilean Government of People's Unity bent upon consolidating their national independence and building a new society of the nationalist measures taken by the Peruvian Government of Peru and its efforts to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and to promote social progress; and also of efforts of the people and government of Panama to consolidate their territorial integrity. The participants welcomed the growth of the efforts being made by the Latin American peoples to recover their natural resources, reassert their sovereignty and defend the interests of their countries. The members agreed that the realization of Latin America's full and true independence is an essential element in the general emancipation process of the developing countries and in the strengthening of international peace and security.\\\"\n\\\"The Conference expressed its full support tor all those Governments which, in the exercise of their sovereign rights over the natural resources of their countries, have nationalized the interests of powerful foreign monopolies and restored them to their peoples in the interest of their welfare and national development. The Conference, moreover, condemned all pressures, threats and reprisals against those countries, and pledged itself to foster mutual co-operation among developing countries so as to impart strength to their national endeavor to fortify their political and economic independence.\\\" \n65.\tCuba proclaims its full solidarity with all revolutionary movements that are tearing off the halters imposed on the peoples of Latin America by North American imperialism and parasitical oligarchies. Fighting in their own stronghold the main enemy of the peoples, they are making a decisive contribution to the general process of the emancipation of the third world and the cause of international peace and security. The struggle of the Latin American people therefore calls for mass solidarity by all progressive and revolutionary forces. It is surely a duty to support those peoples that arm themselves to obtain freedom, and those that face the repressive brutality of Fascist tyrannies in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. To contain the rising waves of revolutionary movements, imperialism organizes counter-revolutionary repression and erases the borders of States. In that fratricidal undertaking it specifically conscripts Brazilian torturers who, overcome by wild delirium, strive to play the role of a minor partner in the North American imperialistic undertaking of subjecting our peoples.\n66.\tBut neither directly nor through the services of hired henchmen can Yankee imperialism dam the revolutionary torrent, nor divert our peoples from the road they are on. The bell has rung for Latin America. Our peoples, formerly mere chattels in history, are now beginning to write it. In the past we suffered history; today we create it with our own hands.\n67.\tLatin America is the stage of the intense stubbornness of imperialism confronting the equal stubbornness of the peoples for so long subjected to it. It was in our continent that the first practices of neo-colonialism were essayed. The peoples of Indian America, dark-skinned half-breeds-which Jose Marti called \\\"our America\\\", to distinguish it from the \\\"wily North\\\"-had conquered their political sovereignty with the sword and the machete at the cost of incredible feats, but they quickly saw that independence was an empty shell, that their countries were still the prey of greedy monopolies that seized their factories, devoured their lands, conquered their mines, and put their national dignity in chains. Peoples imbued with fruitful cultures, the heirs of long and rich traditions of unity and struggle, inhabitants of a continent teeming with natural resources, became the vassals to misery and backwardness, divided by imperialism into feudal holdings.\n68.\tThe imperialist torturer lorded it over our lands; the Yankee marines trampled our beaches and outraged our sovereignty; the proconsuls of the North dissolved governments, dictated policies, and administered countries, which had now become colonies and factories. It was the period of the ripe fruit, the seemed backyard, the docile neighbors; but it was also the time of incessant struggle When our peoples lost their best children in their efforts to obtain their full emancipation.\n69.\tIn the Caribbean the Yankee imperialists started their career of villainy, excess and violence. On our beaches they tested their weapons and began to build their empire. They snatched Cuba and Puerto Rico; they controlled the Antilles, and they fell with more force than ever on the lands of the South. Jose Marti, who understood more than anyone the tenor of the times in which he lived, foresaw the future and called on the peoples of Latin America to fight for their second and true independence.\n70.\tIt, too, was destined to be born on the shores of the Caribbean. With the liberation of Cuba in 1959 there began the new and inexorable process of the destruction of an empire that 50 years earlier had first laid its foundations in Cuba. The Cuban fighters who, on the sands of the Playa Giron, made the Yankees suffer their first American defeat, were opening a new era for our continent; behind their rifles stood an anonymous mass of workers and peasants, of Indians and half-breeds, who had been enslaved for centuries, always humiliated, still unrecognized. It was they who would now march with the decision of those who suddenly find their own strength, with the inspiration of peoples that never bent the knee until final victory was achieved.\n71.\tTo Cuba fell the historic privilege of starting the historic march and pointing out the road. Destiny placed this task on the shoulders of a small people inhabiting a very tiny island, lacking natural resources, separated by geography from the rest of its brothers in blood. But it was no coincidence that our small island had been the minute homeland of Marti. The Cuban people knew how to repel aggression, to turn away provocations, to overcome a total trade and economic blockade and the isolation from a world that was and always would be its own. My country drew strength from the inexhaustible quarries of revolutionary ideas. It was always aware that it has a historic mission to perform: that it must be the bulwark of the revolutionary, internationalist principles of Latin American solidarity.\n72.\tPeople and Government are as one in the immense tasks undertaken; with increasing rhythm the Cuban revolution moves towards the full achievement of its economic, social and cultural objectives. From 1971 industrial production has shown growth rates. Despite being afflicted by natural disasters, agricultural production has also increased gradually. Success in the field of the infrastructure has been significant, particularly regarding building of all kinds. Educational policy, both conceptually, based on the unification of work and study, and materially bespeak a real revolution that is already yielding its first fruits. Forty-four basic secondary schools have been started in the field since 20 September 1971. The rate at which schools are built is also increasing daily.\n73.\tMore than 100 school-construction brigades are working assiduously to build basic secondary schools, poly-technical schools, schools for teachers, technological institutes and schools for vocational training. It is estimated that by 1980 we will be able to bring into the area of work and study more than a million young people, as well as tens of thousands of teachers and educational cadres. As far as public health is concerned Cuba leads the rest of Latin America, as was recognized at the recent Conference of Ministers of Public Health in Santiago, Chile. The development of the sugar cane industry is also being carried out with true impetus in Cuba.\n74.\tThe domestic financial situation has also undergone a healthy transformation. Through its principled policy, the expansion of its international relations with all continents and its fraternal ties with the countries of what is called the third world, as well as the socialist countries and, above with the Soviet Union, Cuba has laid down and strengthened an international position of which it can justly be proud. Our immediate and long-range prospects, in a word, could not be more clear or more promising.\n75.\tWe also note with joy today that Latin America is firmly heading toward full liberation. Throughout the continent rebellion is growing, resistance is spreading, peoples are rising to recover their wealth, to consolidate their independence, to wipe out North American tyranny in one word, to carry out the revolution.\n76.\tBut it will not be an easy struggle. North American imperialism will not yield with grace a world that it has despoiled at will. To keep that world it will use all its maneuvers; it will unleash its power and give free rein to its ferocity. But side by side with that process, there is growing in the very heart of imperialist power itself, a new and growing progressive movement that is anti-imperialist and socialist. In his statement of 28 September, the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government Commander Fidel Castro, stated:\n\\\"We too will be as one with our revolutionary brothers in the United States, as we were with Angela Davis, as we are now, speaking out for the liberation of Billy Dean Smith, and as we will be, with all North American revolutionaries.\\\"\n77.\tLatin America will triumph. No one and nothing can now hold back our peoples because our march is encouraged by and imbued with the memory of entire generations sacrificed to prepare the dawn that is now breaking and because they are called into battle by the immortal example of Ernesto Che Guevara, the undisputed commander who from the very heart of America lights the way, and is a shining beacon guiding our steps to final victory.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for this session, and 1 wish Secretary-General Waldheim well as he embarks on his heavy responsibilities.\n65.\tThere is much violence in the international air, and the atmosphere of it can be felt in this very hall. But we should not forget that the past year has been fruitful for international conciliation. The main theme has been the victory of dialog. Complexes and taboos which had prevented contact between adversaries have almost everywhere been overcome. We read of meetings and agreements between the United States and the People's Republic of China; between West and East Germany; between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland; between North and South Korea; between the United States and the Soviet Union; between the United States and North Viet-Nam; between the rivals of yesterday who are the partners of today in the European community; and even between India and Pakistan on the very morrow of their armed clash.\n66.\tHow improbable all this would have seemed a short time ago! There is a new spirit in international relations. The polemical and rhetorical mood which dominated the past two decades has given way to a strong instinct for conciliation. Hie question that preoccupies nations today is not how they fell into conflict in the past, but how they can live side by side, together, in the future.\n67.\tIf we look more deeply into the successes of diplomacy in the past year, we find a strong similarity in the conditions under which they were achieved. These successes have all been secured by direct settlement. They have all been the result of laborious and reticent preparation. They have all been the product of agreement, not of external adjudication. In every single case the pursuit of agreement has had to take place outside the United Nations frame-work.\n68.\tThis is of course a significant reflection on the institutional condition of this Organization. It justifies a long hard look at its techniques, its procedures and its atmosphere, which have clearly not been congenial to the craftsmanship of peace. The plain fact is that strident public debate is not a good method of peacemaking but a poor substitute for it. An annual exercise in polemics with preordained voting results either paralyzes conciliation or delays its commencement.\n69.\tI said here last year [1946th meeting] that the Middle East was the only area in which the parties to a conflict were not engaged in a dialog to bring it to an end. That is still the situation. Those who will have to live together side by side in our region have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. This is a primary source of deadlock. In all other international disputes the breakthrough has come on the level of communication, and not through substantive commitments ahead of negotiation. The very decision of governments to make contact with each other creates a dynamic of its own. It transforms the context of their relationships and leads to mutual adjustment of their positions and thereafter towards binding agreements.\n70.\tDespite this central disappointment, the Middle Eastern scene has not become darker in the past year. The cease-fire has been maintained. There seems to be less feasibility for full-scale hostilities. Despite deplorable slogans about \\\"inevitable struggle\\\", it is clear that resumed fighting would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The retirement of Soviet forces and equipment from Egypt has stripped the conflict of its dangerous global dimension. Powers outside the Middle East cannot solve our region's problems; they have not fought its wars and they will not build its peace. The idea of a settlement imposed from outside has become visibly weaker. It is explicitly rejected by some of the Powers; and the summit meeting between the leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union in May 1972 revealed what an illusory prospect it is. Once it becomes generally understood that a military solution is not feasible and that an imposed solution is excluded by the international realities of our times, a negotiated peace will emerge as the only valid alternative. The central aim of our policy is to create this consciousness: we aspire to break out of deadlock into a new vision and a new hope.\n71.\tThe developments in Egypt during July 1972 made it natural for the Israeli Government to restate its positions on a negotiated peace. Our ambition is to see an end of belligerency and conflict and to advance towards a peaceful future. Negotiation is not an act of \\\"humiliation\\\" or \\\"surrender\\\" for anybody, as some Arab leaders have said. It is a supreme assertion of national sovereignty and of international responsibility. Courage in leadership does not belong to the battlefield alone; it can be put to the service of conciliation and peace.\n72.\tIn maintaining the cease-fire positions until peace is obtained, we do not seek to perpetuate the cease-fire lines or to freeze the existing situation for ever. Our proposals for permanent boundaries to be established for the first time between Israel and its Arab neighbors will be determined by the need to ensure security and to prevent new wars such as that which arose from the fragile and vulnerable armistice lines of 1967. The construction of a stable peace and security between Israel and Egypt requires a precise, detailed negotiation on territorial delimitation.\n73.\tThe deadlock on the over-all settlement in this sector arises from the fact that Egypt has so far refused to begin negotiation unless its position on the final outcome is conceded in advance. There is no valid precedent for such an approach. Negotiation creates the final result; the final result does not create negotiation. We seek no binding commitments from Egypt in advance on matters that are subject to negotiation. We have not sought to determine the final peace boundary, and we have drawn no alternative maps.\n74.\tIt is unlikely that a transition from complete deadlock to complete peace can be made in one stage. Accordingly, the Israeli Government through its Prime Minister reiterated on 27 July this year its readiness to negotiate a special Suez Canal agreement. Such an accord would be a contribution and a stimulus to an over-all peace. We would consider such an arrangement as a temporary solution and as a step towards peace. In the atmosphere of confidence created by such an agreement, a momentum for further accords would be generated.\n75.\tIt is far-fetched to assert that the positions which I have briefly outlined today offer Arab Governments no possibility of honorable and meaningful negotiation. These principles correspond to the norms of international conciliation. What is required is the application to the\nMiddle East of the spirit and method that have had successful results elsewhere.\n76.\tThe lack of Egyptian response so far to Israel's willingness to negotiate a temporary Suez agreement has long been an obstacle to progress. So, too, is the deadlock created by Cairo's insistence on determining the boundary and withdrawal issues before and without negotiation. In addition, a new massive barrier to peace has arisen through the resurgence of the Arab terrorist outrages which have sent a shock of revulsion through the civilized world.\n77.\tThe story seems unending. Only a few hours ago, the heroes of the Arab liberation movement handed a transistor radio to a woman passenger about to embark on an airliner from Paris to Israel, with hundreds of passengers. It contained a heavy explosive charge. The passenger showed the vigilance necessary to transmit it to the security authorities. The moral qualities of this terrorism come to expression here.\n78.\tWhen the Secretary-General decided to request the inclusion in the agenda of an item on international terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l], he was giving a correct and perceptive interpretation of his rights and duties under the Charter. Organized groups of terrorists, for whom violence is both a means and an end, are threatening the texture of international life. Innocent civilians live in fear of attack by murder squads from abroad. The airlines work in an atmosphere of vulnerability. The international mails are violated by the assaults of cowardly men whose malice knows no compassion and no restraint.\n79.\tThere are many forms and varieties of terrorist violence. They spread like a contagious germ. They respond to destructive and nihilist impulses that have taken root in contemporary culture. And the ultimate arrogance of the terrorists is not that they perform their outrages, but that they then ask for understanding and endorsement. They base their assault on the proposition that all restraints, civilities, immunities and human solidarities must be sacrificed to what they unilaterally proclaim to be their \\\"rights\\\". When they endanger the principles of international order, such as the sovereignty of States, the legal systems of free societies, the universal freedom of the air, the physical safety of men and women who handle the international mail, then the United Nations would lose all credit and repute if its Secretary-General were not to focus its attention and conscience on the approaching abyss.\n80.\tIt is disquieting that the inclusion of the item in the agenda was so strongly opposed that it was nearly lost. Civilized mankind should take a keen look at the Governments which opposed the inclusion of the item or advocated its long postponement. The truth is that their Organization came within a few votes of moral death last week. And the Foreign Minister of Brazil was perfectly right in deploring the General Assembly's failure to endorse the wording of the item as recommended by the General Committee [2038th meeting]. Once the deliberate and unprovoked murder of unarmed civilians is justified by reference to the murderers' \\\"motives\\\" or \\\"frustrations\\\", we might as well include murder amongst the legitimate indulgences of a permissive society and wipe the sixth commandment off the tablet of man's ethical history.\n81.\tThe Israeli delegation will support the draft resolution presented by the United States [A/C.6/L.851] and will give careful study in an affirmative spirit to the text proposed for an international convention against terrorism [A/C.6/ L.850].\n82.\tBut while the problem has its international aspects, especially in aviation and in police security, much depends on the willingness of individual Governments to take measures of prevention on their own soil. The terrorists are particularly active on the territory of free democratic States in which tolerance and hospitality are cherished values. It thus becomes painfully necessary for such States to develop habits of sharp detection and action which are, in a sense, contrary to their easy temperament. But a free society cannot long survive if it fails to defend itself against those who would destroy its freedom and menace its survival by illicit violence. Similarly, many a government must face a moment of agonizing truth when it is called upon to judge the results of giving the terrorists what they want under the threat of dreadful blackmail. To withstand hijackers and kidnappers requires very strong nerves. A compromise convenient for the short term will usually have the effect of giving terrorism a new lease of strength, thereby endangering more victims than are immediately at stake.\n83.\tIn addition to the need for international and national action there is an important area for regional co-operation. The terrorists have made the liberal societies of Western Europe the main arena of their activities. It is here that the majority of outrages against vulnerable aircraft and civilian establishments have taken place. We attach importance and interest to the discussion initiated by the Federal Republic of Germany at the Council of the European Community a few weeks ago regarding measures to combat international terrorism.\n84.\tMy Government has considered certain specific concrete proposals for international, regional and national measures to combat terrorism and we shall bring them forward at the appropriate Committee stage.\n85.\tIt is of course right and inevitable that the item on our agenda [item 92] should be drafted in universal terms. It would, however, be mere pretense to lose sight of the fact that the most rampant terrorism today is that which has its root in Arab hostility to Israel. It was after all the ghastly crime at Munich that gave the incentive for the debate which the General Assembly has decided to hold.\n86.\tIn this context I come to discuss the methods used by Arab terrorist organizations; their political aims; and, above all, the crucial role of Arab Governments in creating and maintaining them.\n87.\tThe original targets of Arab terrorism in the early 1950s were the lives and homes of Israelis on their own soil. The toll was heavy and constant. A bus load of passengers at Scorpion Pass; a group of farmers celebrating a wedding at Patish; a party of scholars on an archaeological expedition at Ramat Rachel; farmers in the collective villages of the Jordan Valley; fishermen on Lake Tiberias. These are random extracts from our nation's memory of bereavement. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual security. A United Nations representative, General E. L. M. Burns of Canada, wrote then of these fedayeen activities that they were worthy of the Nazis. In those days murder was not regarded anywhere as a symptom of revolutionary \\\"progress\\\".\n88.\tThe terrorist bands called the \\\"fedayeen\\\", which, thereafter, became the \\\"Palestine Liberation Organization\\\", developed their main activity in the 1950s and the early 1960s. In other words, they have absolutely nothing to do with the situation created by the 1967 war. Their object has been and is to destroy security of life for Israel, irrespective of what the armistice or cease-fire configuration is at any given time. After 1967 they transferred their violence from frontier areas to Israel's urban centers; shoppers in Mahne Yehuda Market in Jerusalem; housewives in a supermarket; students in a college cafeteria; passers-by in a crowded bus station-and on one horrifying morning a clearly marked school bus at Avivim in Northern Israel. As the mangled bodies of our children, still clutching toys and copybooks, were flown by helicopter to hospitals and morgues, there came across the frontier the gloating voice of Mr. George Habash, Commander of the so-called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, announcing that it was wise to kill Israelis while they were still young. It is difficult to speak or hear of this morbid monster without a cold chill of revulsion. The essential point for these \\\"liberators\\\" is that their victims should be defenseless, vulnerable and unarmed. This is their chivalry.\n89.\tThe rest is part of the recent experience and memory of everyone in this hall. Before the squalid butchery at Munich, the worst horror was at Lod Airport, where a group of depraved mercenaries from a distant land methodically slaughtered 26 civilian passengers-one of them was an eminent Israeli physicist, others were humble Puerto Rican pilgrims coming from the United States. Condemnation was world-wide; but alas it was not universal. Those who take their weekly instruction from the cultivated prose of Hassanein Heykal should ponder his commentary on the massacre at Lod. I quote from an article by him dated 9 June 1972:\n\\\"If there had been three Palestinians there instead of three Japanese I should have been enthusiastic about it, in spite of the fact that at the bottom of my heart I'm for the three Japanese.\\\"\n90.\tThe Egyptian Prime Minister's reaction was less sophisticated and more simple, although it had a note of blasphemy. He invoked divine blessing on the murderous example:\n\\\"I want to say that what happened at Lod Airport proves that we can, with Allah's help, achieve victory in our battle with Israel. This is the only reaction I have to this matter.\\\"\n91.\tIn the history of revolutionary violence there is a constant clash between ends and means. But in the Arab terrorist movement, dedicated to enslavement and genocide, there is no such ambivalence. The aims which Arab terrorism serves are even worse than the means it employs. The means are murder and kidnapping. The aim is not to win freedom for the Arab nation, whose freedom is so\namply and lavishly assured, but to liquidate the national? liberation which the most ancient of nations has already achieved.\n92.\tThere is no need of interpretation here. Quotation is enough. The Palestine terrorist organizations are not at all concerned with finding a solution for the problems of Palestinian Arabs within the framework of a Middle East of which Israel forms a part. This, in fact, is what they are fighting to prevent. The aim is much more radical. Let their leader, Yasser Arafat, speak for himself:\n\\\"Al Fatah started its activities in 1956 and its armed struggle in 1965. Its aim is the liquidation of the Zionist Israeli existence.\\\"\nPresident El-Sadat is often very frank on this theme. On 2 June 1971 he told the Egyptian National Council:\n\\\"The Zionist conquest to which we are being subjected will not be terminated by the return of the occupied territories. This is a new Crusader war which will persist during our generation and through the coming one.\\\"\n93.\tA document called the Palestine Covenant was adopted by all the Palestine liberation groups at the sixth congress of the Palestinian National Council, which met in Cairo in September 1968. The Covenant lays down that the Palestine State is to be an Arab State, that it is to comprise the whole area west of the Jordan not part of it, and that only Jews who were living in Palestine before the \\\"Zionist invasion\\\" could be citizens. The rest -the vast majority- would be pressed to depart. So the aim of this terrorist movement is the liquidation of the solitary Israeli State for the purpose of establishing the nineteenth Arab State. A compact expression of this policy came from former Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad in a press conference in Paris on 1 October 1971, when he said: \\\"I give complete support to the organizations and their program of wiping out the Jewish State.\\\"\n94.\tThe concept of \\\"politicide\\\"-the extinction of the identity and personality of a State-is so unfamiliar, indeed unique, that it may be difficult for other Governments to grasp its significance. Israelis study this notion against the background of another unique experience, the memory of which no other people has ever shared. In the Hitler decade we learned that some things are too terrible to believe but that nothing in our people's history is too terrible to have happened.\n95.\tIn questioning Israel's axiomatic right to security and independence, the terrorist organizations commit a disruptive heresy in the life of our age. They rise up in revolt against history, law, justice, humanity and peace. There are now 18 Arab States, with a population of 100 million, an area of 4-1/2 million square miles and unlimited wealth and opportunity. Facing them alone on the scales of equity is the small State of Israel. There is, therefore, only one nation which stands or falls in history by the way in which this conflict is resolved. By-its solitude and uniqueness, Israel's secure existence is the overriding moral imperative in this dispute. The moral quality of the Arab terrorist organizations is determined not only by their brutal acts but by the destructive vision which inspires them. Their\nclose links with neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations are in full harmony with their inner nature.\n96.\tI have said that the resurgence of Arab terrorism is a massive obstacle or the road to peace. This is not only a reflection on the psychological atmosphere. *t is true that a condition of hate, fear, bloodshed and bereavement works against the prospect of a conciliatory effort, which would be difficult enough in any case. What is no less grave is tha we find it impossible to accept the distinction between these organizations and the Arab Governments which are our destined partners in the peace effort. The support given by those Governments to the organizations undermines the credibility of their peaceful professions and even the professions are few and far between.\n97.\tEgyptian support for the terrorists finds expression in the press, radio and television. The terrorist leaders see Cairo as the center at which they co-ordinate matters of common concern with the League of Arab States. Egypt serves as the center where the heads of the terrorist movements meet the representatives of the various Arab countries passing through Cairo. Not a week passes without a central Egyptian personality meeting with a terrorist leader for co-ordination and co-operation. Cairo Radio gives a special program on Palestine in which terrorist activities are constantly praised. The special radio station broadcasting from Cairo, called \\\"Saut Falastin\\\", belongs entirely to the terrorists, who are free to broadcast what they like. The station broadcasts constant agitation and incitement against Israel and justifies every terrorist action.\n98.\tEgyptian support on the military level is very broad. On many occasions delegations of the organizations with Arafat at their head pay visits to Egyptian army camps in the rear and at the front. Arafat wears an Egyptian army decoration for valor.\n99.\tThe terrorist organizations are permitted to carry on activity everywhere in the country to mobilize volunteers. Apart from their own independent mobilization machinery, they receive active support in this respect from the Libyan Embassy in Cairo, which openly signs up volunteers, pays them and sends them to Libya for training.\n100.\tDelegations from the various terrorist organizations receive information and instruction in Egyptian military bases. The Fatah stands apart from the rest and has special privileges in Egypt. Its members actually go through training together with Egyptian soldiers in the ranks of the Egyptian army. The \\\"Ein Jalud\\\" unit of the Palestine Liberation Army is commanded by an Egyptian officer. Egypt also helps the organizations with supplies of arms, ammunition and other military material.\n101.\tThe crisis that broke out between Lebanon and the terrorists in June 1972 brought to the fore Egypt's role as guardian and protector of the organizations. Realizing that the terrorist movement might find itself obliged to quit Lebanese territory, the Egyptian President took action to forestall any Lebanese attempt to harm the terrorists. Mahmoud Riad, Secretary of the League of Arab States, was sent as a special mediator. President El-Sadat was not content with that. He sent his personal representative to Beirut in order to exert pressure on the Lebanese Government not to cancel the Cairo agreement of November 1969, which provided for the terrorists' presence in Lebanon.\n102.\tEgypt's leaders address the terrorist bodies at all their conferences. In any clash between the terrorists and their victims, the Government sponsors the terrorists' cause. In September 1970 a Pan American aircraft landed in Cairo, where the hijackers calmly blew it up in the sight of the authorities. When the Jordanian Defense Minister was murdered as a guest on Egyptian soil, his hosts allowed the murderers to go free.\n103.\tIn Lebanon there are 5,000 terrorists, whose constant activity is undisturbed by the authorities. Under the Cairo agreement between Lebanon and the terrorist organizations, the Lebanese Government granted the terrorists legal recognition, freedom to organize and a base for activity against Israel. Beirut is the seat and center of terrorist planning and propaganda. It is from Beirut that groups set out with detailed plans to commit murder and hijackings and set off explosions in Europe and elsewhere. It was in Beirut and Baalbek that Kozo Okamoto received shelter and training for his assault on the airport at Lod.\n104.\tSyria was the first Arab State which supported terrorist activities from the outset. President Al-Assad said on 2 September 1971 in the weekly journal Al Mussawar that:\n\\\"... the fedayeen are to be found in more than one area of Syria, and they have absolute freedom of movement on the Syrian front. Moreover,\\\"-said President Al-Assad-\\\"we encourage and stimulate them and often we complain that they are not sufficiently active . . .\\\".\n105.\tLibyan support for terrorist assaults in the Middle East and Europe needs no documentation. President Qaddafi's admiration of the Munich murderers was rhapsodic and explicit.\n106.\tWhatever the position may be with other terrorist groups, there is no truth or value in a discussion of Arab terrorism which does not face the fact that it is a recognized arm of Arab Governments in a policy of war against Israel. These organizations could not exist, still less function, without the shelter, support, endorsement, financial aid, arms, training facilities and territorial bases supplied by certain Arab States. All the activities of these organizations without exception violate the principles which the signatories of the Charter including Arab signatories-pledged themselves to defend. It is not an accident that the Governments which sponsor Arab terrorist organizations are unable to fulfill normal international obligations. The Arab Governments have not signed the Tokyo Convention;  they have not signed the Montreal Convention;? they have not responded to the Secretary-General's proposal for drawing the attention of the twenty-seventh session of this Assembly to the problem of international terrorism [A/8791 andAdd.lJ.\n107.\tNow. whether or not the General Assembly can take effective action in this matter, it does at least possess the capacity of accurate judgment. Such honorable words as \\\"liberation\\\", \\\"resistance\\\", \\\"commando\\\" have no application and have never before been applied to attempts to liquidate a lawful sovereignty, to compound the Nazi assault on Jewish survival and to wage a campaign of indiscriminate assault against civilians in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n108.\tThe attitude of Arab Governments towards Arab terrorists is today a graver obstacle to peace than the admittedly disparate positions of the parties to the problems of withdrawal, boundaries, navigation, peace, etc. I say in all frankness: I cannot today believe that Egypt and Syria are willing, or that Lebanon is able, to make peace with Israel; and in that profound skepticism the attitude of those movements to terrorism plays the central role.\n109.\tThe discussion must inevitably take us back to a consideration of the word \\\"Palestine\\\" that appears as the title of the terrorist organizations. Now, is it true that there is a distinct people deprived of self-determination, languishing in poverty, squalor and humiliation, dependent on organized violence as its sole prospect of redemption? Nothing could be further from the truth.\n110.\tThere are some 2-3/4 million Palestine Arabs in the world today. Three quarters of them are in the original territory of Palestine, on both sides of the Jordan that is to say, under Jordanian rule or within the area at present under Israel's jurisdiction. The other quarter are in Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, 1,300,000 Palestine Arabs now hold Jordanian citizenship, which has been available to them since 1950, when Jordan annexed the territories of the west bank with the consent of the Palestinian leaders.\n111.\tFor the entire period of the armistice regime between 1949 and 1967 all Palestine Arabs-except a few hundred thousand who are citizens of Israel were living under Arab sovereignty and Arab flags. In other words, the question of their civic and political identity was a matter for determination by Arab Governments and authorities alone.\n112.\tThe Kingdom of Jordan was a Palestinian State, in the double sense that a majority of its citizens were Palestinians and a majority of all the Palestinians in the world were citizens of that State.\n113.\tIn a final peace settlement a new permanent boundary will be drawn between Israel and its eastern neighbor. Some hundreds of thousands of Palestine Arabs would in all conditions be a community within the State of Israel; this is normal. There is no such thing as 100 per cent self- determination, although the Arab nation comes closer to that figure than any other in history. Those Palestinian Arabs who will be outside Israel's permanent boundary once it is drawn will be free to determine their future in conjunction with the Arab Governments and peoples concerned.\n114.\tAs recently as 8 September 1972, the Israeli Prime Minister made it plain that in her conception of a peace agreement there would have to be important modifications of the previous armistice lines in order to preserve security and to avoid new wars. But she added that it was not her conception that under such an agreement the vast majority of all the Palestine Arabs in the administered territories would have to fall within Israeli jurisdiction.\n115.\tIt follows, therefore, that the political status of the Palestine Arabs would find its solution within a peace settlement. Now, here is the most drastic paradox of all: the \\\"Palestine Liberation\\\" organizations are the implacable opponents of an Arab peace with Israel. Yet nothing but peace with Israel can clarify the political and civil destiny of the Palestine Arabs in a manner compatible with Israel's sovereignty and security, with regional peace and with their own basic interests.\n116.\tIn the meantime, this community is not languishing in despair and poverty: there is a new freedom of movement and contact. The national product of the Samaria-Judea-Gaza areas, administered by Israel since 1967, in which a million Arabs live, has nearly doubled since 1968. The per capita income has risen from \u00a31 670 in 1968 to \u00a31 1,100 in 1972. The agricultural product has tripled. There were less than 4,000 private vehicles in 1969; there are nearly 7,000 today. There were 3,000 television sets there in 1967; today there are 40,000. Fifty thousand workers find labor opportunities in the Israeli market, from which they bring back \u00a3 1300 million a year. There is no unemployment. Wage levels have trebled since 1967. The value of exports from these territories has risen from \u00a3 1220 million to \u00a3 1305 million.\n117.\tPerhaps more significant than the language of statistics is the spectacle of human contact, commerce and exchange that brings hundreds of thousands of Israelis and hundreds of thousands of Palestine Arabs into a normal and fruitful communion the like of which never existed before.\n118.\tIn the latter half of 1971, 200,000 Arabs from neighboring countries freely crossed the Jordan bridges towards Israel. It is not inconceivable that, when the agreed peace boundary is drawn, the relations between Israel and its eastern Arab neighbors could evolve across open boundaries into something like the community structure in parts of Western Europe today.\n119.\tSo while Arab terrorists in Beirut and European capitals manufacture their bombs and plot their assassinations, the majority of the Palestinian Arabs are living solid lives enriched by a widening contact with their neighbors still clouded, of course, by a lack of political definition, but nevertheless alive with the hope and prospect of a peaceful regional future.\n120.\tThere is, of course, hardship in every sector of Middle Eastern life. But there is not one single problem of the Palestinian Arabs that can be advanced towards a solution by the action of the terrorist groups. There is not one single legitimate interest of the Palestinian Arabs that would not come to reasonable satisfaction in a negotiated peace settlement between Israel and its neighbors. The terrorist groups are not only the enemies of law and order across the Middle East and in many parts of the world: they also alienate the Palestine Arabs from their true interest and their authentic vocation.\n121.\tThe problem of curbing the terrorists is now our most urgent preoccupation. We are resolved to resist and weaken them in our region. We believe that national, regional and international action against Arab terrorism is an indispensable prelude to the fruitful exploration of peaceful prospects for the Middle East.\n122.\tI have spoken of psychological and human obstacles on the road to peace. Some of these obstacles could easiK be removed. I refer, for example, to the problem of prisoners of war.\n123.\tThere are 10 Israeli prisoners of war in Egyptian hands; they have been there for two and a half to three years. On the other hand, Israel holds 61 Egyptian prisoners of war, most of whom have been in captivity for nearly three years. Syria has been holding three Israeli prisoners of war for the last two and a half years. Israel holds 45 Syrian prisoners of war. Israel also holds 10 Lebanese prisoners of war.\n124.\tWith the cease-fire well into its third year we propose the mutual release and repatriation of all prisoners of war. The arithmetical advantage is overwhelmingly on the Arab side; but in the broader human sense everyone would gain.\n125.\tThe Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949 lays down in article 118 that: \\\"Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.\\\" This provision of the Geneva Convention is clear and definite. In accordance with it there should have been a release of prisoners when the cease-fire entered into force on 7 August 1970.\n126.\tArticles 109 and 110 of the Convention provide that prisoners of war who are seriously wounded or who are seriously sick must be sent back to their own country even before the cessation of active hostilities.\n127.\tIt is reported that Egypt considers the six pilots amongst the Israeli prisoners that it has captured as being of greater importance than the 60 Egyptian prisoners held by Israel, who are mostly ordinary soldiers. But this is certainly not a humane approach to the problem. All prisoners of war, irrespective of rank, must be released in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Geneva Convention. A gesture of goodwill by Egypt and Syria on behalf of 115 Arabs and 13 Israeli prisoners would help diminish the acute lack of confidence which now obstructs any progress towards peace. What valid argument can there possibly be against this course?\n128.\tAt the same time our Jewish destiny and responsibility inspire our concern for the plight of the small Jewish minority in Syria where 4,500 Jews are held as helpless hostages, forbidden to depart, discriminated against, humiliated, their movement restricted, essential services denied them, their property confiscated, and their livelihood in constant jeopardy.\n129.\tThe plight of Syrian Jewry has been brought to the United Nations General Assembly and its Committees in the past. Two years ago committees to help the Jews of the Arab countries arose in 25 different countries in four continents, and an international committee came into existence. Some of the Arab countries responded to the humanitarian pressure of world public opinion and permitted the Jews who had remained in their territories to leave. Only Syria has persisted in its present position. Public opinion should not rest or remain silent until the imprisoned are released and the Jews of Syria permitted to reach safety.\n130.\tYear in and year out the problem of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union comes to the General Assembly and its Committees.\n131.\tThe history of the Jews in Russia is a continuous chain of hardship and suffering from the days of the Tsars until the present time. Recently their urgent aspiration to emigrate to their historic homeland has broken through the barrier of silence. Thousands have reached Israel, where they have been received with a deep poignancy arising from a long separation. Many people of goodwill throughout the world saw in the emigration of these Jews, however few, a sign of broader tolerance and humane understanding.\n132.\tBut there has now been a setback; while still permitting the emigration of thousands of Jews, the Soviet authorities have placed limitations on the freedom of movement of scores of thousands in disregard of their fundamental human rights. Many have been arrested just for wishing to go to Israel and have been sentenced to imprisonment. The Soviet information media publish calumnies, slanders and incitement against them.\n133.\tMany of those who register in the emigration offices are dismissed from employment and thus lose their livelihood. An open anti-Semitic campaign is being conducted, and in the period 1971-1972 alone, dozens of anti-Semitic books have been published in the Soviet Union, in addition to the anti-Jewish campaign conducted by the press and official media of information.\n134.\tAnd now as part of the attempt to dissuade Jews from submitting applications for exit permits to Israel, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics decided on 3 August to impose a special tax on Jews with higher education who wish to go to Israel. This effectively deprives thousands of people of any possibility and any hope ever to join their families and to realize their national aspiration. A scale has been established for each level of education, sometimes reaching $25,000 and more per person.\n135.\tIt seems to us that the Soviet argument on the brain drain is not relevant or applicable here. The Soviet Union is not one of the needy developing countries, and Israel is not offering Jewish members of the scientific professions who come from the Soviet Union superior financial rewards. Israel is only able to give them a home, where they will feel as Jews who are not being discriminated against.\n136.\tLikewise irrelevant is the argument that graduates are obliged, as it were, to repay the cost of their education.\n137.\tThe noted Soviet demographer, Urlanis, states in an article published on 26 July 1970 in Literaturnaya Gazeta that, in the conditions obtaining in the Soviet Union, the average university graduate repays by four years' work the State's investment in his training. The majority of scientists have thus already repaid that investment many times over by their creativity, their invention, their research and their professional work. The decree is not only a harassment of thousands of Jews, it is a serious infringement of intellectual freedom and scientific liberty. It creates the enslavement of scientists and intellectuals whose only crime is that they have studied and worked and contributed to the progress of their country, and today obey the call of their historic consciousness and wish to pursue their intellectual and social vocation elsewhere.\n138.\tScientific personalities and institutions across the world have reacted with astonishment and indignation to this limitation of intellectual freedom. It is precisely because we wish to see a greater harmony between East and West, between the Soviet Union and the West, in all fields, including that of science, that we raise our voice in protest against this superfluous obstacle to international understanding.\n139.\tThe General Assembly moves towards its agenda in an atmosphere of crisis for international institutions. There was never a time when a universal framework for international relations was more objectively necessary than today. Yet the concept of international organization is still surrounded by apathy and doubt. The United Nations should act with consistent purpose within the real limits of its capacity and strength. It should reinforce its role in international development in the light of the difficulties and dislocations revealed at the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago. It should take a careful course on the problems of the environment which were impressively brought to light at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in June. We must not allow an exaggerated ecological alarmist to act as a brake on accelerated development: for poverty and backwardness in most of the world have a more polluting effect on the life of our age than the excesses of industrialization in a small part of it. We should complete it universality by the admission of Bangladesh to membership. And we must not discredit our protest against racial discrimination in the southern parts of Africa by a craven silence about the brutal and capricious persecution of Asians undertaken by the present ruler of Uganda. The distribution of tasks and responsibilities between sovereign Governments and international institutions requires a delicate exercise in understanding. The United Nations must become an instrument for solving conflicts, not an arena for waging them. It should take a diplomatic, not a parliamentary view. Its task is to provide and promote consensus and agreement, not to take refuge in illusions of enforcement or adjudication. If we temper ambition with restraint we may yet endow this Organization with a constructive purpose and enlarge its humane role in the history of our turbulent age.\n"

Your unanimous choice as President is a tribute paid at one and the same time to the heroic Polish people and to you, whose prestige and competence are guarantees of the successful conduct of the work of the Assembly.\n125.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and to inform him of how much my Government appreciates his constant and devoted efforts to achieve detente and international co-operation. In these delicate circumstances where, in a world ravaged by conflict, there is at last a slight glimmer of peace, we are happy to find in our Secretary-General all the necessary qualifications to assist us together to find the appropriate ways and means of keeping alive and even increasing that glimmer of peace for the greater welfare of mankind.\n126.\tAt the same time, I should like to endorse, with great gratitude, what has been said by eminent representatives who have preceded me, in paying tribute also to our outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, for his patient and unflagging efforts in the search of a just and lasting peace in the world, and particularly, in our region of South-East Asia.\n127.\tWhile I am addressing you, the Khmer people, innocent victims of an unjustified and unjustifiable foreign aggression, is still suffering in its own flesh and blood. Its sufferings are such that neither the comfort nor the ultramodern installations of this glass palace, nor the distance that separates me from my country, can banish from my mind the image of the ghastly spectacle of the exactions committed by the invaders against our civilian population: women mourning their husbands; children, their mothers; monks, their monasteries that have been devastated; and the refugees, their lost homes.\n128.\tIn this abyss of suffering, where its North VietNamese neighbors have plunged it without reason, the Khmer people is struggling with courage and determination for its destiny, its survival and its very existence as a nation. It is that very conviction that is our strength, a moral strength that no subversive campaign and no weapon can weaken. In this struggle to liberate out country from the claws of foreign invaders that are militarily better equipped and better trained, the Khmer people needs, if not assistance, at least understanding and encouragement from all the peoples who have committed themselves formally to honoring the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n129.\tMore than at any other time in its existence, the Khmer people has realized how great is the danger for mankind if the United Nations does not intervene to help to call an immediate halt to a systematic and foolhardy aggression on the part of North Viet-Nam against a peaceful people, whose only crime has been that of wishing to live in peace within its own frontiers and with good understanding with all nations, particularly, its neighbors, without any distinctions of ideology, race, religion or system of Government.\n130.\tA State that recovered its independence and sovereignty in 1953 and a Member of the United Nations since 1955, Cambodia then and the Khmer Republic now has given proof of being an exemplary Member, one which, in all circumstances, in peace as in war, has always scrupulously complied with the principles of the Charter and the agreements and commitments it has assumed. Unfortunately, our conduct did not prevent open aggression, an attack inflicted with impunity by the troops of North Viet-Nam and the Viet-Cong. This can be no other than deliberate aggression, since the Khmer Republic and the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam have no common frontier, being separated one from the other by the Kingdom of Laos and the Republic of Viet-Nam.\n131.\tThis aggression is all the more unjustifiable since it is against a neutral and peaceful State, a demographically and militarily weaker country that has never threatened any other nation. Deeply imbued with the principles of Buddha, the Khmer people, with its 3,500 monasteries and its 70,000 monks in a population of 7 million inhabitants that is, one monastery for each 2,000 inhabitants and one monk for each 100 persons is reputed to be one of the most peaceful peoples of the world.\n132.\tFurthermore, after the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements of 1954, my country has never joined any military pact and never authorized the installation of any foreign base of any sort on our territory until the last years of the 1960s when its ex-Head of State, Sihanouk, in a secret agreement, without the knowledge of the Khmer Government and Parliament, authorized the clandestine installation of sanctuaries for the North Viet-Minh and Viet-Cong. It was from those bases that the 60,000 North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong soldiers in March of 1970 launched their open attacks against Khmer army that had only 32,000 men, despite people's demonstrations in the provinces, as well as in the capital, that requested their withdrawal from Khmer territory.\n133.\tIn the light of that situation, the Khmer people had no other choice but to organize itself for resistance, a national resistance that was and is a typical case of legitimate self-defense as provided for in the Geneva Agreements of 1954 as well as in the Charter of the United Nations.\n134.\tEvidence mounts day by day, attesting to the increased atrocities committed not only against our defense forces, but, over and above all, against our civilian population, our children, our Buddhist monks, our doctors, without counting the manifold destruction caused to our economic, cultural and social infrastructure, or the acts of terrorism committed against peaceful inhabitants in their towns and villages. This aggression, which is an obvious fact, is amply proved by the many captured weapons and documents as well as by the declarations of North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong prisoners held at present in Phnom Penh. A number of foreign observers that have free access to Khmer territory since April of 1970 no longer challenge the reality of this invasion despite the efforts of enemy propaganda to camouflage it by representing its four North Vietnamese divisions (the first, fifth, seventh and the ninth) and the C-40 Viet-Cong regiment as the so-called army of Sihanouk.\n135.\tIn fact, besides those 60,000 North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong invaders, there are barely 30,000 \\\"red Khmers\\\", of which 6,000 rallied to the legal Government as of last 30 August. Furthermore, the latter are made up of disparate elements, the overwhelming majority of which do not even make use of the name of Sihanouk in their own propaganda within the country, knowing that that name is rejected by the Khmer people. Moreover, they constitute neither an army nor a political force, since they are used only for propaganda and as arms carriers for the aggressors, or are forced to perform minor tasks of supply and logistics.\n136.\tObviously, the consequences of North Vietnamese aggression have been cruelly felt by the Khmer Republic and its people.\n137.\tAbout one third of the 181,000 square kilometers of the territory is still under the occupation by the forces of the aggressors, who have endeavored to sow terrorism and insecurity wherever they have been able to do so. Approximately one seventh of our population of 7 million are forced to live under the control of the enemy under a regime of terror imposed by the invaders.\n138.\tIt is out of fear of suffering enemy occupation that our peasants, usually deeply attached to their rice fields and their native soil, have not hesitated to flee their lands in order to seek refuge in the zones controlled by the Government. Thus far, approximately 700,000 refugees have fled to the capital and the main provincial towns. This immense exodus has caused an imbalance in the demographic structure of the country, with over-population in that part of the territory which remains free and under- population in that part occupied by the aggressors.\n139.\tIn August last, after having conducted massive bombing of the civilian population and used some hundred heavy ultramodern tanks against our defense forces, the North Vietnamese invasion forces used poisonous gas shells, which are weapons strictly prohibited by international conventions.\n140.\tThe occupiers are attacking our communications lines, our works of art, our public utilities administrative buildings, hospitals, infirmaries, schools, plantations, plants, industrial enterprises, and so on.\n141.\tFurthermore, these invaders did not even respect the works being carried out under the auspices of the United Nations to help the developing countries. The most shocking proof of this was the attack planned and carried out in 1971 against the construction sites of the Prek Thnot Dam, which is located in the Province of Kompong Speu and is intended to irrigate vast areas of land for the benefit of the people.\n142.\tTherefore, our enemies do not even spare the undertakings of an economic and social nature of the United Nations itself.\n143.\tSpecial mention must also be made of the depredation and occupation of our monuments at Angkor by the Viet-Cong troops, contrary to international law, particularly the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, done at The Hague on 14 May 1954. The danger is all the greater since the invaders, after the armed occupation of that zone, have turned it into a veritable logistics and military base by digging bunkers and building other defenses without having shown the slightest regard for these vast monuments that are considered and admitted by all nations as being one of the richest cultural treasures of mankind.\n144.\tSince 11 June 1971, the Government of the Khmer Republic, profoundly concerned by the fate of these occupied monuments, appealed to all Governments and all men of goodwill all over the world to help neutralize the Angkor zone and place it under international control.\n145.\tIn this connexion I should like to express, on behalf of my Government, our warmest thanks to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, and to Mr. Ren\u00e9 Maheu, the Director-General of UNESCO, for the great efforts they made before they succeeded in having the Angkor monuments listed under the special protection of the above- mentioned Convention.\n146.\tWe are glad to mention that on 25 August last the period for objection to that listing expired. We therefore appeal to all the signatory States of this Convention, as well as to all the Governments of the world, actively to help from now on, by joint efforts within the framework of the Convention, to preserve these monuments from destruction and damage due to enemy occupation.\n147.\tFor its part, the Khmer Government has taken all the necessary precautions under The Hague Convention to avoid any damage to this heritage of mankind.\n148.\tFor all the reasons I have just mentioned, it appears to us urgent that the international community at last take effective action to put an end as soon as possible to North Viet-Nam and Viet-Cong aggression against the Khmer Republic. This foreign aggression, which is continuing even today with increased intensity, constitutes a grave threat not only to the existence of the Khmer people but also to that of all the neighboring peoples, which are peaceful and do not have any expansionist designs.\n149.\tIn the Khmer Republic there is only one struggle: the national struggle of the Khmer people to free its country from these invaders. In the Khmer Republic today there is only one foreign aggression: the North VietNamese and Viet-Cong aggression, because there are neither American troops nor American military bases on our soil. In contending that they are \\\"liberating\\\" us, the foreign invaders are in fact only seeking to liberate the Khmer country from the Khmers. Is that not a true definition of annexationism, of colonialism or of imperialism? \n150.\tThis aggression is in clear and open defiance of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and of the fundamental principles of our Organization, which advocate respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, large and small, non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, and non-aggression and peaceful coexistence among all political and social systems.\n151.\tThis barbarous aggression, of which the Khmer people is the victim, has only one positive aspect, that of having awakened and consolidated our national consciousness in the face of the threats of the enemy from outside.\n152.\tThat aggression, regardless of the atrocities committed, has still not sapped or weakened our firm determination to create a new society based upon the principles of democracy, that is, that all power comes from the people and that only the people is sovereign.\n153.\tResponding thus to the aspirations of its people, the Government of the Khmer Republic has specifically laid down the groundwork for democracy by establishing republican institutions.\n154.\tThe Khmer people has definitively renounced a traditionally feudal monarchy and adopted a republican constitution on 30 April 1972, after a national referendum.\n155.\tIn the presidential elections of 4 June 1972, the Khmer people by universal and direct suffrage elected Marshal Lon No! as the first President of the Republic. The first National Assembly and the first Senate of the Khmer Republic were respectively elected on 3 and 17 September last.\n156.\tThis change of political regime was due to the fact that the Khmer people no longer wished to tolerate the excesses of its monarchs who, during 2,000 years, kept the people in slavery. All the Khmers remember the dictatorial methods with which the former King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk, who later became Head of State, led our country. We still remember too well the hundreds of Khmer patriots who were summarily and savagely executed on his orders, accused solely of being Communists and so forth, whereas in reality they merely opposed his anachro-nistic regime.\n157.\tI must restate that the removal of Sihanouk from power was not the result of a coup d'etat, as some of his friends of the moment contend, but it was a legal deposition, carried out in accordance with the constitution then in force. Raised to the highest office of the country by the Khmer Parliament 12 years ago, Sihanouk was deposed by that same Parliament by the unanimous vote of its members on 18 March 1970.\n158.\tAll this shows how ridiculous and irrelevant were the words pronounced yesterday by the representative of the People's Republic of the Congo when he referred to my Government and our republican regime. That representative was hardly the one to refer to us as \\\"a clique thrown out by the people\\\" [2045th meeting, para. 238] and boast of the merits of a prince in exile when that representative himself represents a clique which, not long ago, eliminated a leader risen from the people, President Massemba Debat and as everyone knows by hardly democratic means.\n159.\tDoes one call it \\\"a clique thrown out by the people\\\" when one speaks of a President of a Republic and a Parliament elected by universal and direct suffrage?\n160.\tDoes one call a \\\"legal Head of State\\\" of a country a Head of State who, having betrayed the higher interests of his people, was deposed by the unanimous vote of the two Houses of Parliament?\n161.\tWe deny that representative of the People's Republic of the Congo any right to interfere in the domestic affairs of our country or to claim to know them better than we do.\n162.\tIn brief, in his zeal to plead in favor of a Government-in-exile that represents no one but itself and that was so truly \\\"thrown out by the people\\\" that it is still permanently located on foreign soil, Mr. Henri Lopes is doing less than justice to the People's Republic of China when he compares the rights of the latter in the United Nations with those of the so-called Royal Government of Sihanouk.\n163.\tAlthough deeply concerned over the bitter struggle to survive against an enemy which is particularly ferocious and which is determined to wipe it from the map of the world, my country has at no time overlooked or ignored its duties and its obligations as a Member of the United Nations. Thus my country continues and will continue unflaggingly to participate actively in the work of our Organization in the various fields of international cooperation.\n164.\tWe remain fundamentally opposed to racial discrimination in all its forms or manifestations and wherever it may appear. It is in fact inadmissible that human beings today can still be victims of discrimination of any sort because they belong to one race or another, one religion or another, one color or another, or one ethnic group or another.\n165.\tThe Khmer people has always rejected any form of discrimination, because nothing would, be more contrary to our Buddhist principles, which are primarily based upon tolerance, compassion and respect for all living beings.\n166.\tThus, too, our traditions of resistance and particularly our present-day struggle to repulse the foreign invasion can only strengthen day by day our constant and sincere determination to uphold the genuine movements of liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke. What we refuse to accept is that the sacred term \\\"the liberation struggle\\\" should be used to camouflage the realities of aggression. We therefore strongly oppose those pseudo-liberator. movements which, under the pretext of freeing one country or another that has already gained its independence, interfere in the domestic affairs of that country and, in fact, practice expansionism and annexationism to the detriment of other countries.\n167.\tWith regard to the so-called \\\"divided-country problem\\\", the Khmer people welcome with satisfaction the latest developments towards detente and peaceful coexistence of those with different political and social systems. In accordance with our own aspirations for peace and international co-operaticfn, we trust that that trend towards reconciliation will be strengthened on the basis of reciprocity, mutual respect and the principles established to govern relations among States, pending a reunification that must be achieved according to the principles of self- determination, without foreign interference and, if necessary, with the assistance of international organizations.\n168.\tAs one of the peoples that has suffered from acts of terrorism on the part of our invaders, the Khmer people can only express its gratitude for any initiative taken to prevent such crimes against humanity. Our delegation hopes that without passion or prejudice, the United Nations, aware of what has occurred, will give urgent attention to this problem in order scientifically to devise appropriate and suitable concrete means to combat effectively this type of crime, condemned as it is by all civilized peoples.\n169.\tWhile welcoming the recent developments leading to the reduction of tension in the world, and particularly in Asia, we must voice our hope for a successful conclusion of the talks on general and complete disarmament.\n170.\tWith regard to the conflict in Viet-Nam, we are relieved to note that a number of initiatives for peace have been undertaken, not only by the great Powers, including the United States of America and the Soviet Union, but also on the part of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore.\n171.\tThe Government of the Khmer Republic feels that the Vietnamese conflict cannot be successfully and justly solved unless there is a global solution, namely, a general cease-fire in the whole Indochinese peninsula, followed by the withdrawal of foreign troops from each of the three countries: the Kingdom of Laos, the Republic of Viet-Nam and the Khmer Republic.\n172.\tWe are always ready to contribute to a peaceful settlement in order to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Khmer territory on the basis of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and in accordance with the joint communique in May 1970 at the Djakarta Conference on Cambodia. The Khmer problems will be solved by the Khmers themselves, without any foreign interference.\n173.\tThe situation in the Khmer Republic is a typical case of foreign aggression, open and blatant, against a people that has not crossed its frontiers by one millimeter to threaten any other country or attack it.\n174.\tSuch a situation must be one that confronts the world with a moral issue.\n175.\tA small country such as mine must wonder whether the innocence of a people and its scrupulous respect for the principles of the Charter and of international law could be considered to be sufficient guarantees of peace or whether the crime of aggression is to continue to go unpunished after 27 years of the existence of the United Nations.\n176.\tAs I said earlier, at this very moment while I am addressing you, my compatriots are still suffering in their struggle to defend a cause that could not be more just or legitimate. Your words, Mr. President, spoken on ^September, echo particularly our own hearts when, speaking of Poland, you said:\n\\\"My country owes its existence, its freedom, its independence and its present dynamic development to great effort on the part of its people, but also to tremendous sacrifices. This unites us with the many peoples of the different continents for whom the struggle for freedom was a struggle for national existence.\\\" [2032nd meeting, para. 55.]\n111. The Khmer people is today doing nothing but fighting for its national existence; and it was in that spirit that Marshal Lon Nol, President of our Republic, when speaking to the Deputies on 14 September last on the occasion of the opening of the National Assembly, said:\n\\\"The North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong Communists that so savagely attacked our country have not only sown death and ruin but, over and above all, they have showed the criminal intention of killing our new Republic at its inception. They want to restore a reactionary regime that is obedient to them and that has worked to ensure their expansionist and imperialist aims. They have imposed on us a war without mercy. The Khmer people has, however, taken up the challenge. Young and old, civilians and soldiers, all have rallied to the defense of their country in danger. Their sacrifices have allowed our nation to reject the foreign yoke and to live freely and independently thus far.\\\"\n178.\tFor these reasons, the Khmer people are fighting and will fight with determination and energy against the foreign invaders. Like all peoples throughout universal history, the\n-Khmer people continues to have faith in the sacred principles which are the foundation of our Organization and of the dignity of man.\n"

        "file_text": "): I should first of all like to convey the greetings of the President of Kenya, H.E. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, to the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n2.\tMy delegation also wishes to convey its felicitations to the newly elected President of the General Assembly, Mr. S. Trepczynski, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic. With his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations, his wide experience and exceptional ability, the present session should sail to a successful conclusion.\n3.\tThe outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, conducted the business of the twenty-sixth session with dispatch, fairness and exceptional skill. To him we express our deep gratitude.\n4.\tMy delegation deems it appropriate to address a word of welcome to the new Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has, indeed, inherited an exacting job. We have no doubt that, with his proven competence and total commitment to what the United Nations stands for, he will perform brilliantly in his high position of service to humanity at large. Those of us who know the Secretary-General well are conversant with his deep interest in Africa. His sustained efforts to promote decolonization and development have been noted with appreciation throughout Africa. His deep commitment to accelerated disarmament is also very well known and appreciated in our continent.\n5.\tEvery year we congregate ritually in New York for the General Assembly session. Every year we return to our countries having passed a vast number of resolutions and having poured out endless rhetoric that gets recorded in documents of the United Nations that are produced by the ton. However, strangely enough, a program of action, particularly in the political arena, is conspicuous by its absence; expressions of pious hope find no concrete reality; swelling rumbles of economic discontent pass unnoticed; threats to peace continue in ever-widening dimensions. International issues of a complex nature are tainted by competing ideologies and cold war politics and polemics. The Security Council finds itself locked in bitter debate and magnificent inaction in emergency situations. The liberation of over 30 million enslaved and colonially dominated Africans still remains an undischarged responsibility on the part of the international community. Escalation of conflict through massive injections of sophisticated arms to areas of potential and actual war are too frequent. Economic development in the third world remains at an embryonic stage. World markets, advanced technology and international finance are still the zealously guarded preserves of the affluent States. Although new horizons are opening up in space technology, the exploitation of resources of the sea and the application of environmental controls, it remains to be seen how the newly emergent nations would share the ensuing benefits.\n6.\tIt is necessary that certain basic needs be met before peace can triumph over conflict, before understanding can dispel mistrust, and before co-operation can replace political inducements and friction.\n7.\tThe primary need must necessarily be that the interests of nations, small and large, rich and poor, are equitably accommodated to promote peace. It is necessary that international relations must be democratized to enhance understanding, promote co-operation and ease tension.\n8.\tThe historic visits of President Nixon, first to China and later to the Soviet Union, have set in motion the process of detente. This is of monumental importance to orderly world relations and must be carried out to more extensive limits. It is only through personal contact, the objective evaluation of the inextricably bound up interests of all nations, the acknowledgment of existing realities and a certain grant of mutual concessions, that tension can be lessened.\n9.\tEast and West Germany have constructively and positively adopted this approach, which promises to bring ultimate political stability, understanding and co-operation to Europe, long and repeatedly subjected to the savagery and horror of countless wars.\nA/PV.2039\n10.\tThe recent dialog between North and South Korea, after years of bloodshed, sustained propaganda and incalculable loss of life and property, is another forceful reminder of the wisdom of a policy of conciliation and restraint as compared with that of armed confrontation and naked aggression.\n11.\tThe decades-old bitter dispute between India and Pakistan, which was responsible for four devastating wars in 25 years, has also been made amenable to peaceful settlement through direct contact between the leaders of the two countries. That is why my country warmly welcomed the Simla Agreement for the normalization of relations between the two countries.\n12.\tIn the same context I cannot but hope earnestly that the tragic and prolonged war in Viet-Nam will also respond to the same process. Negotiations in Paris to terminate this war seem to be making satisfactory progress. We long for the day when, through negotiation, a permanent, equitable and honorable settlement will be arrived at, not in the field of battle but round a conference table.\n13.\tKenya applied the same sentiments and hopes to the situation in the Middle East where no peace has been known for almost a generation and where blood-letting, reprisal measures and indiscriminate loss of life and property characterize relations among the embattled nations. \\\"Die Kenya Government continues to hope that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) will prove to be the corner-stone for a just, durable, and an expeditious settlement of the Middle East crisis.\n14.\tI should also refer to some of the most explosive disputes that were defused peacefully on the African continent. I need only refer to the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], which met in June 1972 in Rabat, where Algeria and Morocco buried the hatchet over the territorial dispute that had plagued their relations for a number of years. This is what we call in Africa today \\\"the spirit of Rabat\\\". We hope it will spread like wildfire to all other troubled spots in the world.\n15.\tWe certainly hope that the spirit of Rabat will prevail over the present troubled situation in East Africa which imperils the traditionally fraternal relations among the countries of the region. My Government will steadfastly work for the peaceful solution of any problems that have arisen and will demonstrate in action its deep concern for the preservation of the East African community and for the smooth running of its common services. Our salvation lies in accommodation, not confrontation; in peace, not warfare; in understanding, not acrimony. Our common destiny, future aspirations and past heritage only emphasize this necessity.\n16.\tThe next cardinal responsibility that we must discharge is that of eradicating colonialism once and for all. Despite the fact that the world has witnessed an era of decolonization where no fewer than 41 States attained independence and sovereign equality in the comity of free nations, vast areas in Africa remain afflicted with minority racist regimes. Millions of Africans in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are held in colonial bondage by supremacist and unrepresentative orders.\n17.\tThe Africans, under repressive laws and police terror, are denied fundamental rights to life, liberty and property. The rule of law does not exist. Judicial safeguards such as they exist in theory are fictional. Arbitrary exercise of authority and abuse of discretionary powers are commonplace and highly rewarded. Large-scale eviction of Africans from settled areas and their replacement by whites from the unemployment pools of Europe is the official policy, which is being carried out ruthlessly without ever arousing qualms of conscience in anyone in authority. Generous supplies of military hardware to the supremacist regimes flow in from countries which never tire of proclaiming their love for liberty, equality and fraternity. Actually they play the role of death merchants under the guise of angels of peace and security. They are openly militarizing the racists to increase their oppressive capacity and to enforce their racist laws with unprecedented harshness. The immense natural resources of these captive lands are exploited to enrich the racist overlords, who live affluently by the toil, tears and sweat of the Africans. Apartheid, the epitome of racism and organized State terror, is being systematically and unashamedly extended to Namibia and Rhodesia.\n18. In Zimbabwe the categorical rejection of the Anglo- Rhodesian settlement terms by the overwhelming majority of the people of Zimbabwe must be followed by concrete steps, such as the following:\n(a)\tA constitutional conference of all interested parties should be convened under the aegis of the United Nations. The fundamental purpose of the conference would be to accelerate the advance to African majority rule in Zimbabwe.\n(b)\tThe scheme of sanctions should be strengthened and stringently applied. The sanctions should be made more comprehensive and should be applied to the ports of Beira and Lourenzo Marques.\n(c)\tAny country that commits violations of the United Nations-imposed sanctions should be identified and exposed. Member States of the United Nations may thereafter invoke such retaliatory action as they deem appropriate with regard to the offending States.\n(d)\tThe United Nations should consider recommending to States the refusal of landing rights to national airlines which land at Salisbury and whose Governments permit Rhodesian airplanes to land in their countries.\n(e)\tAll postal, telegraphic and related communications between Rhodesia and the States Members of the United Nations should be cut off.\n(f)\tThe United Nations should work out a scheme of confiscation of Rhodesian exports of tobacco, asbestos, chrome and other Rhodesian minerals at the place of entry in the importing country.\n(g)\tWays and means should be found to secure the expulsion of the South African military units and police contingents now stationed in Rhodesia.\n(h)\tAll Governments, organizations and private institutions should be urged to render moral and material assistance to the liberation movements of Zimbabwe, which operate both internally and externally, in order to oblige Smith to disgorge his political power in Rhodesia.\n(i) All States bordering Rhodesia which fear aggression from Rhodesia, South Africa and the ruling Portuguese clique should be given guarantees of protection by the United Nations. Considering the armed aggression that continues to be unleashed systematically by the Portuguese colonialists against Guinea, Senegal, Zambia and the United Republic of Tanzania, the need for such guarantees is obvious. What is most important is that these guarantees should be made enforceable and should not remain mere paper commitments.\n19.\tWith regard to Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), increased assistance of every form to the gallant liberation movements operating in those Territories is essential. Already vast areas have been liberated. Rehabilitation facilities are being made available with the assistance of world churches and other Governments, institutions and individuals that espouse the cause of African independence. The enlightened elements within Portugal, aware of the turbulent winds of change, must recognize the futility of a Portuguese colonial war in Africa. The States Members of the United Nations must not be fooled into believing that weapons and equipment supplied to Portugal through the sources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] for the defense of Europe are not systematically channeled into the Portuguese Territories to annihilate the African aspirations to independence.\n20.\tLarge countries which are friendly to both Africa and Portugal and which share and maintain political, social and cultural ties with Portugal can exercise decisive influence in changing oppressive Portuguese policies. Such countries are sympathizers with the African cause for freedom and independence. We should ask them to use their unique position and good offices to advance self-determination in the Portuguese Territories in Africa.\n21.\tWith regard to Namibia, my Government shall support every endeavor aimed at securing an effective United Nations presence and control in this Territory. This is in conformity with the decision on Namibia taken by the International Court of Justice, last year,  the resolutions of the General Assembly and the various decisions of the Security Council on this subject. I also wish to register the strongest condemnation and indignation on the part of my Government at the attempts being made by South Africa to extend the discredited system of apartheid to Namibia. The spontaneous and wide-spread reaction against this policy in so-called native homelands constitutes a clear verdict of its rejection by the people of Namibia as a whole.\n22.\tThe position of free Africa on the vital question of decolonization is crystal clear. We have made every concession, explored every possibility and consulted every interested party to arrive at a peaceful solution. However, all these efforts have been met with an unresponsive, rigid and uncompromising stance. Faced with this attitude of the minority regimes of southern Africa on the one hand and the immense suffering of the African people on the other, Africa can only work for a peaceful solution if possible, for diplomatic accommodation if just, and for resort to arms if necessary. All these options have been kept open.\n23.\tThe Committee of Liberation of the OAU is continuing with the armed struggle designed to liquidate colonialism and its last vestiges from the soil of Africa. We ask for the help of every State member of OAU, the non-aligned movement and the United Nations in the discharge of this sacred and inescapable duty. We ask for this help in the interests of world peace, justice and the orderly conduct of inter-State relations throughout the world.\n24.\tThe OAU mission on decolonization has traveled extensively and explained free Africa's viewpoint to leading world capitals. The results of this exercise have been encouraging. Enlightened world opinion, exposed to the new depths of savagery of the colonial regimes, has rallied to the African cause of freedom and independence. The World Council of Churches, the Governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and many private institutions and individuals have given assistance to the victims of colonial aggression in those Territories. Swedish and Italian firms have been persuaded to withdraw their participation from the Cabora Bassa project in Mozambique. In the present circumstances it can only be regarded as a colossal scheme of exploitation of the vast natural resources of Mozambique. It is also noteworthy that member States of NATO, like Norway, have in the NATO Councils openly condemned Portuguese colonialism in Africa. We appeal to the other members of that alliance to emulate the courageous Norwegian move, which will greatly accelerate decolonization in the Portuguese-held Territories of Africa.\n25.\tNow that world opinion is focused on the untold suffering, injustice and humiliation heaped on the colonized people, the United Nations must give a renewed lead to liquidate colonialism and its consequences from the world scene.\n26.\tPolitical independence by itself lacks substance unless it is complemented by economic freedom. This can only be derived from developing a self-generating economy to produce wealth for the benefit of all the citizens of a State. To achieve this objective all national resources, human and material, must be marshaled intelligently for nation- building on a basis of self-reliance. Foreign aid alone is not sufficient for nation-building; the self-help effort is of paramount importance in reducing total dependence on foreign aid.\n27.\tThe development effort must be identified with intensified trade and co-operation, diversification of industry, modernization of agriculture, and the provision of facilities for employment, education, social welfare, and so on. This exercise, in turn, can only produce beneficial results if it is based on access to technology, capital and planning techniques. If their proper utilization in the development endeavor can be ensured, corrosive poverty can be eradicated, wide-spread illiteracy progressively reduced and rampant disease substantially controlled.\n28.\tOn the international plane the developing countries in collectivity must gain liberal market access in the developed countries for their primary commodities and manufactured and semi-manufactured articles. Newly emergent nations must ensure that they enjoy an increasing share in world trade, which has been markedly shrinking every year.\nStability of prices for their primary commodities must be secured if their fragile economies are to withstand success-fully the thrusts of unpredictable economic changes. International monetary reforms must take account of the vital interests of developing countries, whose economic system can fall an easy prey to the decisions of a few rich countries. The development endeavor can only become concrete and effective if transfer and implantation of technology in developing countries can be achieved. It is necessary that the receiving State should be able to develop technical capacity as well as a capacity for inventiveness. This should be the essential role of technical assistance and co-operation. All these objectives form part of the International Development Strategy for the implementation of the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It is therefore essential that, through a co-ordinated exercise, the developing countries in collectivity exert maximum pressure on every platform to achieve the objectives outlined above.\n29.\tThe developing countries must take full advantage of the new vistas opened by science and technology in the field of outer space and the environs of the oceans.\n30.\tNew scientific and technological break-through have enabled man to exploit the vast resources of the oceans and the seas which have been inaccessible hitherto. It is now universally recognized that these resources, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, constitute the common heritage of mankind and are not subject to national appropriation by any State, and that this area should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. It remains to give substance and detail to these important principles. This should be done through effective international machinery and subject to equitable and orderly exploitation and utilization of the resources of the sea for the development of all countries.\n31.\tIt will of interest to the General Assembly to note that my country put proposals to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction which met in Geneva [A/8721, pp. 180-182]. We have proposed the establishment of exclusive economic zones beyond national waters for the primary benefit of the peoples of the coastal areas and of their economies. It is intended that such States should exercise sovereign rights over natural resources within the economic zone for purposes of the exploration and exploitation of living and non-living resources of the sea and for research. Such States should be empowered to prevent and control pollution without prejudice to freedom of navigation, freedom of over-flight and freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines in conformity with recognized principles of international law. It should be noted that our proposal expressly guarantees the rights of land-locked States of every description. We hope that it will be received sympathetically by States Members of the United Nations.\n32.\tEnvironmental control is a subject that has aroused intense interest on the part of every State throughout the world. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment recognized that for developing countries the problems of the human environment arise from conditions of poverty and underdevelopment, whereas for developed nations such problems arise from affluence and pollution. We must ensure that these questions of the human environment are treated within the context of development. Therefore all environmental actions of the United Nations must be integrated within the existing objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n33.\tThe Stockholm Conference recommended the establishment of a 54-member governing council for environmental programs.  The capital of my country, Nairobi, was mentioned as a possible location for its secretariat. My Government would be happy to accept that suggestion.\n34.\tIn conclusion, I have outlined my Government's position on some of the fundamental issue: t :at confront us today. In the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in conformity with its aims and objectives, the world community, through the United Nations, must work together for the liberation of the colonially-dominated peoples, for the economic advancement of all peoples, for the conquest of disease and illiteracy and for the improvement of our environment and the exploitation of the vast resources of the sea for the benefit of all peoples. Let us work to replace confrontation with negotiation, mistrust with good faith and impressive rhetoric with effective action.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honor for me to come to this rostrum at the United Nations and to speak in this forum where we meet every year to resume the threads of the great international dialog and to expound the basic positions of countries on the problems affecting relations among States within the framework of this Organization.\n134.\tMay I at the outset convey to you, Mr. President, the warmest congratulations of my Government, and my own personal congratulations, on your well-earned election. In choosing you the General Assembly has done nothing other than pay a tribute to your noble country and to the years that you have devoted to the cause of peace and to the Organization itself in the many and delicate responsibilities that your Government has entrusted to you.\n135.\tI can not fail to pay a tribute to Mr. Adam Malik, whom the Peruvian Government had the honor to receive as a guest during the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 developing countries in Lima. His ability and tact ensured the harmonious development of the General Assembly's debates at its last session.\n136.\tMay I also sincerely congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim on his designation to his highly sensitive post. The new Secretary-General of the Organization is a personality whom we know well from his earlier diplomatic activities in his country's service, in which he showed outstanding ability and a special vocation for the ideals of peace. This gives us assurance that his leadership of the Secretariat will be guided by the same principles and qualities.\n137.\tThe Government of Peru wishes to pay a tribute of profound respect to former Secretary-General U Thant, who for 10 years unselfishly gave himself to the tasks of building a world at peace. To achieve such a noble goal, U Thant bent his most serious efforts and earned the appreciation of the international community.\n138.\tWe are witnessing a qualitative change in contemporary history: the classic economic and social systems and the political and philosophic tenets on which they rested are being revised. A new revolutionary stage in the history of mankind is emerging, whose basic trend is the search for new approaches which will make possible the achievement of peace and security in justice, both domestically kid in international relations.\n139.\tFrom the very outset of its task of transformation, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of my country realized that it would be impossible to succeed unless that task was understood as a shattering of internal domination and external dependence, key contributing factors to under-development. A real transformation of the social and economic structures that would alter the relations of political power in our society so as to create a democratic, humanistic and just community was not feasible unless our efforts were directed simultaneously abroad, whence, to a large extent, originated the major events that took place within our country.\n140.\tDuring the four years it has been in power a period completed just a few days ago, on 3 October the Revolutionary Government has been laying the ideological and political foundations on which it is building the new Peruvian society. These foundations were clearly defined by the President of the Republic, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, when in July of this year he stated:\n\\\"The revolution aims to create a pluralist economy, based on three fields of activity: a sizable State sector, a private sector of reformed enterprises enjoying all the guarantees of stability and respect which it requires, and a social property sector to whose support the State will give priority-all three aimed at the creation of a social democracy of full participation for all.\\\"\n141.\tThe economic pluralism to which I have just referred will permit real and progressive participation by citizens at all levels in the decisions which affect their destiny. Policy, understood in its wide sense as action on the social whole, will be exercised on a community basis in the daily activities of the citizens, who in taking decisions on their enterprises, their institutions or their trade unions will be deciding on and guiding the fabric of their society at their own particular levels.\n142.\tThere can be no true revolution without a transformation in man. Structural change means, basically, a change in mentality within the social and economic process. That is why new guide-lines were necessary in the field of education. The new Education Act sets up a new system in this decisive field and will progressively lead to a better and more adequate adaptation of our people to their environment. If we want true culture and not a transplanted culture, we must teach man to know and to recognize himself within the specific confines of the environment in which he is destined to live. His world must be created and organized around the everyday experiences of his own life and from this fruitful interrelation there must emerge a new culture that will place him, and allow him to know how to fit himself into his rightful place, individually and socially. We can be sure that the Peruvian who emerges from this process will achieve a worthy and independent society, humanistic and free, qualitatively different from the one that has existed until now.\n143.\tThe transcendental events that spelled the beginning of our revolutionary process and that are known to this Organization were followed by the clear-cut definition of the principles and acts that Peru considers would constitute a foreign policy in keeping with the new reality which is felt in all our sovereign undertakings and which is consistent and consonant with our domestic policy.\n144.\tDevelopment was not possible without breaking the circle of dependency. That is a collective task, one that calls for full awareness of self and faith in our destiny as a community that is emerging in the form of healthy nationalism, which is the most important factor in our social identity and in our integration as a country.\n145.\tNationalism and independence are therefore the pillars of our foreign policy nationalism as the recognition of ourselves; independence that allows us the freedom of decision necessary to achieve our destiny.\n146.\tThus the principles of universality in our foreign relations and the respect for ideological plurality are the ground rules that govern our relations with regard to the changing international scene. We have acted consistently and initiated dialogs with all countries of the world, establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Albania and New Zealand, as well as extending recognition to Bangladesh.\n147.\tThe world of the cold war, built around two hegemonic centers of power from whose unlimited strength it was almost impossible to escape, has now become a multi centered structure of varied balance in which alliances are not total or antagonisms final and in which the search for satisfaction of the interests of the smaller countries is feasible given the wider margin of play. The awakening of the third world is, in this process, one of the most significant events of our times. The full and honest incorporation of Latin America in the process of awakening is an especially enlightening development.\n148.\tIn Latin America we recognize the existence of individual and differing ways that do not gainsay the community of interests of the continent, which is embarked on a course towards economic independence. We share similar problems of under-development, culture and our undeniably common origin. In this interaction within the structural unit of which the Latin American peoples consist, there must be recognized variables between agreement and disagreement, and between greater and lesser relationships, as occur in the life of human communities. Yet it would be difficult for us to understand our relations in terms of hegemonies, of positions of predominance that might, in themselves, contradict the traditional fraternal relations that we have maintained even when differences have appeared.\n149.\tThe common economic and political experience in foreign affairs has given Latin America a structural character that goes beyond the mere convergence of culture and mentality. It now possesses its own genuine history, formed within its own tangible circumstances, forged in the defense of common interests in the face of external pressures that affected all equally-a history that has been woven around shared interests, but also let us say so frankly around shared frustrations. This concept of Latin American existence has already begun to foreshadow the outline of the whole, which knows itself to be varied and sees itself as different within the international concert. Yet this very concept endows it with an awareness of a self that has emerged individually from among its components as a sort of Latin American nationalism that, ultimately, will carry us to the point where our histories will converge in a form of communitary integration.\n150.\tAt present, the relaxation of tension is a process that touches every sector of the globe and, within it, we have constantly claimed a relocation of Latin America within the new context which, precisely because of its flexibility, may well be favorable.\n151.\tIt was this conviction that led us to submit our request of April last to the Organization of American States. In that request we contended that change had also made itself felt in America, and that therefore there was no justification for the isolation from the system of one of our sister Republics.\n152.\tTo uphold in 1972 the views that in 1964 led to the adoption of measures against the Republic of Cuba is to deny the advance of history, the evolution of ideas, and the qualitative changes that occur in the lives of peoples.\n153.\tIn July of this year Peru had the great satisfaction of renewing diplomatic relations with the Republic of Cuba, firmly convinced as it is that fraternity lies not in words but in deeds.\n154.\tFrom its very inception, the Revolutionary Government of my country has encouraged integration efforts in Latin America, aware that a truly liberating economic process cannot be completed without the integration of vast geo-economic areas which will allow the use of scale economies, which alone can ensure full development and are able to compete on the world market.\n155.\tThe Treaty establishing the Latin American Free Trade Association was, therefore, a fundamental contribution to the formation of an integrationist mentality in Latin America, and has permitted the creation of the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement, which has acquired tremendous impetus.\n156.\tThe agreements recently arrived at within the frame-work of the Andean Agreement are clear proof of the firm desire for integration that fills and inspires the countries parties to the Agreement. Integration, for us, is basically an undertaking for joint development, in which the creation of the productive machinery is from the outset converted into a common task. The approval of the joint industrial program for the establishment of the machine-tool industry shows the degree of compromise and the dimensions of the problems of development and, also, the will to arrive at a true agreement on integration.\n157.\tTogether with all other Latin American countries, Peru is undergoing profound transformations and finds itself aligned with the countries of the third world, with, which we share a common denominator: under-development. For when we clearly understood the realities of our life as an under-developed and dependent society undergoing forms of domestic domination that were an extension of foreign dependency, we also discovered that our condition was shared with the countries of the third world which, in different ways, are tending towards liberation. Thus we find ourselves in a new situation. We are part of the so-called third world which daily, with wealth, generated out of its own poverty, contributes to the opulence and the power of the industrialized societies.\n158.\tWe also realized that political independence is not enough to achieve true emancipation; that there persist subtle forms of political, economic, finance and technological domination geared to the maintenance of old forms of domination. Under-development is, to us, therefore, a multidimensional phenomenon. It emerges in the economic field but does not end there. It spreads to the entire social fabric and affects the cultural, ideological and political fields.\n159.\tThe multi centered world that is emerging today must, as it does, show an equal multiplicity of structures in the economic fields, where the process of political detente must also be reflected. But if this were not enough to contribute to an improvement in the conditions of development of the third world, then we could not, in justice, contend that the risks of a conflict have diminished. For peace and prosperity that are founded on a position of structured under-development at the international level will always be precarious, no matter how noble and worthy the political and trade agreements worked out by the major Powers.\n160.\tThe results of the three sessions held by UNCTAD, and especially that held this year in Santiago, have convinced us of the need to restate their supporting rationale in order to restore the mystique that surrounded them at the outset and that aroused so many hopes in our hearts.\n161.\tWithin a new articulation of the world's economic affairs the third world must devise a consistent and united strategy that will make of it a single and sufficiently powerful unit. Our countries should continue to group together on the basis of productive interests, in order to acquire genuine negotiating strength that will ensure better prices for our products. This in turn will lead to our increased participation in the profit earned from trade in those products and thus we shall be in a position to recover sovereign control over the natural resources which give rise to that wealth.\n162.\tIn the circle of domination and dependence which characterizes the structure of the relations .between developing and more industrialized nations, there is an element of distortion that contributes to imbalance, I refer to the multinational corporations on firms which have acquired a marked economic, financial and political influence in States, whose participation in world trade and capital flow is much larger than that of many countries, and which very often evade the traditional pattern of payments. The third session of UNCTAD showed the growing preponderance of these corporations that control between 20 and 30 per cent of the output of world trade, and alarm was expressed over their speculative role in the world monetary crisis.\n163.\tThus far, the United Nations has not been able to deal with this important aspect of development but this failure will allegedly be corrected by means of resolution 1721 (LIII), recently adopted by the Social Council, which requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to designate a group of experts to study the behavior of such multinational corporations, particularly in the developing countries, and their impact on international relations, so that their recommendations may guide Governments both in the adoption of sovereign decisions and in agreeing on appropriate international action.\n164.\tIn the light of all these circumstances, which clearly highlight the problem of under-development and in the light of the political and economic reality which determines and conditions under-development, a most valuable initiative emerged from the third session of UNCTAD, namely, the idea of preparing a charter of the economic rights and duties of States and of establishing the relevant machinery for such a Charter. At the sUbregional, regional and world levels, Peru has taken an active and constant part in the laying down of principles to govern economic relations among States, and we are ready to participate also in this fundamental task of creating an appropriate international legal framework.\n165.\tThe monetary crisis, its restrictive effects on trade and finance, and the Smithsonian Agreement, adopted without the participation of the developing countries, have had consequences that are prejudicial to the countries of the third world through their net losses in their dollar reserves as a result of the readjustment of exchange rates and other unfavorable developments in their terms of trade as well as the burden of foreign debts.\n166.\tThe need to ensure the participation of the developing countries at the decision-making level in monetary and trade questions of vital importance to the international community was the purpose of the initiative strongly urged by Peru in the Group of 77 developing countries concerning the creation of an intergovernmental group on monetary questions. The final constitution of the group and the important recommendations made therein are to be presented now to the Committee of 20, established by the International Monetary Fund. We trust that an over-all solution to the monetary problem will be found through that group. If not, it will inevitably have to be sought in a world monetary conference, as was initially proposed by Peru.\n167.\tWith regard to the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations to be held in 1973 within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the developing world has clearly defined the- principles that must govern the talks to avoid the marginalization of which it was the victim at the time of the last Kennedy Round. A further postponement would have dire effects on the economies of the members of the Group of 77 and, hence, on the welfare and progress of more than two thirds of mankind.\n168.\tInternational assistance is a duty and not philanthropy. Through it, the industrialized nations return a minimal part of what we have unquestionably provided them for the consolidation of their development and power. Aid, in order to deserve that name, must be free and not subject to contractual conditions. Peru rejects the type of assistance that is burdensome, that carries conditions and is provided on terms of political and economic subjugation, for it then becomes a pressure tool to bend the will of the needy countries against their own interests. Far from encouraging development, such assistance generates further poverty and dependency and belies the most elementary principles of international co-operation, which is intended to channel multilateral aid that should be accompanied by safeguards for sufficient decision-making power without the existence of pressures of any kind. My country, from its own experience, knows the stumbling blocks and difficulties encountered by requests for financing submitted by countries seriously embarked upon an independent course of development.\n169.\tBut assistance must also be sufficient to reach the targets set by this Assembly itself for the Second United Nations Development Decade. According to the Assembly official financial assistance to the third world should be equal to 0.7 per cent of a country's gross national product.\n170.\tAlthough some industrialized countries have advanced towards this goal, the President of the World Bank himself has admitted that by 1975 average official assistance will have reached merely 0.35 per cent, that is, half of the target for the Second Development Decade. Yet this is happening at a time when the gross national product of the industrialized countries is increasing rapidly, leaving the developing countries behind and, most important of all, dramatically widening the gap between the wealthy and the poor countries of the world.\n171.\tObviously, this situation cannot continue indefinitely and if the flow of official financial assistance settles at a level that is considerably below the target set for the Decade, which seems likely at present, then the international community will sooner or later have to face the need to reassess and restructure the terms of foreign indebtedness of the developing countries, whose fledgling economies will no longer be able to carry the burden of a growing mortgage upon their income, which is, unfortunately, all too often the experience of the countries which make up the third world.\n172.\tRegarding the question of the law of the sea, events have taken place that are important for the nations that would establish a just order for the use and exploitation of the oceans.\n173.\tThe People's Republic of China in the United Nations, jurists of Asian and African countries at Lagos, the participants in the meetings of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination of the Group of 77, and of the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Caribbean, as well as the recent official statement of the Government of Cuba all, in one way or another, reaffirm the right of coastal States to dispose of the marine resources within the Emits of their national jurisdiction limits which an increasing number of nations have proposed should be set up to 200 miles. UNCTAD included this right among its new principles. Support for this view was voiced anew by numerous countries from the various continents at the recent meetings of the Committee on the sea-bed designed to prepare for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. To all this must now be added the latest proclamations from the Governments of Gabon, Mauritania and Oman that extend the exercise of their jurisdiction beyond 12 miles and, in particular, the courageous attitude of the Government of Iceland to which my country reiterates its solidarity on this occasion.\n174.\tThe facts mentioned are tangible and conclusive proof of the degree of international support achieved for the maritime doctrine which establishes a 200-mile limit in the new law of the sea.\n175.\tHowever, this vigorous trend does not seem to have been fully understood in all its implications by a small group of maritime Powers which are determined to establish a narrow zone of coastal jurisdiction in order to be free to exploit foreign waters at will.\n176.\tIn any case, I believe it appropriate at this time to dispel any possible doubts on the issue by reiterating here the firm and unwavering position of Peru to maintain, and enforce respect for, our sovereignty and jurisdiction over the waters adjacent to our coast, including the soil and subsoil thereof to a distance of up to 200 miles, in order to promote the development and well-being of our people. This decision, not only adopted by the Government of Peru, but also shared by the Peruvian people as a whole for 25 years now, rests upon basic geographical, ecological, economic, social, political and juridical foundations that have been set forth at length in different international bodies and whose validity cannot be ignored since they flow from a law of nature and considerations of justice that must prevail over mercantile designs or the desire for hegemony of faraway nations, regardless of how powerful they may be.\n177.\tThe resources of the bountiful fishing grounds lying off the coast of Peru whose existence would seem to be a form of compensation for the same natural conditions which determine the aridity of our coasts-are and will always be considered by Peru as an integral part of our nation's wealth whose use by our people no nation has the right to dispute. Let none believe that this truth-and this determination which is irrevocable can ever be flouted as long as one single Peruvian lives.\n178.\tThe detente that is today clearly evident, has still not dissipated man's feeling that he is still living in the shadow of fear. The end of the dualist and antagonistic division of the world has in no way meant the end of power politics and confrontations which conditioned international relations over the last decades.\n179.\tNeither the sparse results of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva nor the negotiations at the highest level between the super-Powers have given sufficient hopes for a solution to the world disarmament problem. Furthermore, there seems to be every indication of a lack of a definite will to assert a realistic and honest policy which would lead to final disarmament.\n180.\tFurthermore, we cannot fail to mention-or, one might better say, to denounce the tendency among certain Powers to accuse the developing countries of fomenting arms races among themselves. Behind this fallacious allegation lies the definite purpose of disguising, on the one hand, the magnitude of their own burdensome expenditures and also, and perhaps primarily, of shifting the responsibility that they bear for the development of the poorer countries. I repeat here, we consider that security is conditioned by development and, therefore, it is not in our interest to expend enormous amounts on armaments.\n181.\tThe great Powers, dominated as they are by the tyranny of technology, spend enormous amounts modernizing their weaponry without considering the already precarious state of world security and certainly without a thought for the legitimate rights and interests of the nations of the third world. My Government therefore supports a restructuring of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to provide for the participation of all the nuclear Powers, and an increase in its membership so as to allow equitable representation for developing countries.\n182.\tIf we have stated that the development of nations is closely linked to international security, it is obvious that world disarmament, and therefore nuclear disarmament, is the basic goal of all mankind at present. The vast sums spent on these activities and the dangers they represent to the human environment have repeatedly been considered by the international community in this Assembly and in other forums, such as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm last June, where we have asked for a condemnation of and a halt to nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere.\n183.\tRegrettably, we find that in the programs for nuclear weapon testing in the South Pacific, the announcement of a final suspension of tests in the atmosphere to be carried out over the Mururoa Atoll in the future has not been forthcoming. Peru once again condemns these tests and we shall continue to bend every possible effort to insure a cancellation of such nuclear tests which are undoubtedly a danger to mankind.\n184.\tAt the present juncture in international affairs, Peru is following with great interest and, as is only natural, supports the general trend towards a relaxation of tension, as reflected in the establishment of talks at the highest level between China and the United States, in the Berlin agreements and in the understandings between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea on the independent and peaceful reunification of the country without interference by any foreign State. We are also encouraged by the agreement reached by Pakistan and India on a withdrawal of troops from the Asian subcontinent.\n185.\tThe process of relaxation of tension which extends also to the European scene calls for a re-evaluation of the specific political and economic situation in that continent. This would seem to indicate the need for the holding of a conference on European security and co-operation which will doubtless spell the beginning of a new era in the relations among countries of the continent, the ramifications of which will affect the whole world.\n186.\tWe are attending a new session of the General Assembly, and so far no peace has yet been achieved in the\u2003Middle East. Despite the efforts of this Organization, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has still not been implemented. We repeat to this Assembly our conviction that any solution that we attempt to provide for the conflict in the Middle East must be fitted into the framework of that resolution if guarantees of lasting peace are to be achieved.\n187.\tWe also consider it of the highest importance that the Suez Canal should be reopened, as was stated at the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 and at the third session of UNCTAD. The continued closure of the Canal causes considerable damage to the economy of the area.\n188.\tIn Asia, the Viet-Nam conflict shows no sign of ending soon. The forces involved continue their bloody struggle, magnified now by the use of sophisticated weapons. No thought is given to the terrible sufferings of a people that will not forget the horrors of this holocaust for centuries to come.\n189.\tThe Revolutionary Government of Peru considers that in the case of Viet-Nam no matter what solution may be considered to end the war, it will obviously have to be based upon the exclusion of intervention by other countries, so that the people of Viet-Nam will thus be able to exercise its right to self-determination.\n190.\tPeru will support any endeavor designed to have our Organization assume its proper role in the urgent search for solutions to put an end to that conflict, consonant with the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n191.\tThe threat to world peace and security as well as to the effectiveness of this Organization as an instrument for the peaceful settlement of international disputes becomes more acute in the face of persistent problems such as colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid.\n192.\tThus, consistent with its own traditions and its sincere belief in social justice, Peru reiterates its support for the Security Council resolutions condemning all colonialist policies and reaffirming the application of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia, as well as the resolutions of the General Assembly which repudiate all forms of racial discrimination and apartheid.\n193.\tThe world as a whole was shaken by the tragic events that took place during the recent Olympic games. These events only strengthen the views of those who affirm that the present world, in a paradoxical way, is generating an infernal dialectic of violence to combat violence.\n194.\tThe Peruvian Government morally repudiates acts of international terrorism which convert any region of the world, including countries that are not parties to any dispute, into zones of irrational and pointless violence. My country has therefore always advocated in absolutely clear terms international arrangements within this Organization to increase security in the world.\n195.\tMy country understands that very often violence is only a mistaken outlet for despair originating, perhaps, in conditions incompatible with the human condition. Social and economic conditions and the frustration of the just aspirations of peoples play an important role in this reaction.\n196.\tPeru condemns these acts recently committed against innocent victims, and also voices the most severe censure against other forms of violence that seek to obtain through vengeance what ought to be claimed from the human justice and the conscience of nations.\n197.\tThe United Nations should become the definite means of reaching understanding among men and peoples; one through which differences will be overcome through a new approach, one by whose help the contradictions of wealth and poverty, development and under-development, will become less deep and lead to the humanization of men of all latitudes.\n198.\tIn the era of revolutionary change in which we live an era in which ideas and customs, concepts and actions are questioned in depth the United Nations continues to provide the best and most appropriate framework for harmonizing change and overcoming conflict. The limitations in which this work is carried out do not detract from its importance or weaken our faith. The inconsistency between the lofty aims of the Organization and much postponed justice confirm our certainty that no solutions are possible without the will and true agreement of the parties involved.\n199.\tNow that a better disposition toward dialog and coexistence seems perceptible among nations in a spirit of understanding and respect for a reality consisting of a plurality of concepts and ideologies, we believe that Organization can fulfill its mission and come closer to its lofty aims. It is because of this that the people and Government of Peru sincerely renew once again their very firm and convinced adherence to the principles of the Charter and their confidence in the destiny of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "The United Nations continues to be the great hope for mankind to organize relations among States in a system based on peace and the dignity of the human person. On this road towards full justice the world becomes each day more united in its historic destiny. For this reason my opening words must be a greeting to those who constantly serve this ideal and, first of all, to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and to the President of the General Assembly, who is presiding over our work with such impartiality and efficiency. This is the great forum of the nations, whose hallmark is freedom of expression and in which our problems can be discussed.\n40.\tThe year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has confirmed the trend that we noted towards an almost total liquidation of the so-called cold war. This is a circumstance which is welcomed by all nations despite the difficulties still encountered in the work for peace. But it is a fact that hatreds are disappearing as are also the territorial scars of the frontiers whose recognition by the German nation was, until a short time ago, in doubt.\n41.\tToday there is the possibility of a policy of under-standing between Eastern and Western Europe, and the day is not far distant when the once separated blocs will begin talks on a European security agreement. This is a new example of the efficacy of regional security arrangements, which Latin America advocated at the San Francisco Conference as being the true interpretation of the precepts of the Charter dealing with regional arrangements, based on the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. At\\\" that time this Latin American doctrine appeared to be a heresy from the universality of the principles of the nascent Organization, but time has shown that in the solutions of the problems of peace regionalism is the best way to achieve international co-operation.\n42.\tFurthermore, with the entry of the People's Republic of China the balance between the two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, has been replaced by a triangular concept of world decisions. Whatever our position may be with regard to the entry of that great Asian country to the world Organization, the fact is that the road has been opened to multi-polarity in international policy, which is further strengthened by the fact that the number of independent States which have shaken off the tutelage of colonialism and achieved the category of Members of the United Nations has increased steadily.\n43.\tIn this last third of the twentieth century we are nearing a truly world-wide political order which has far outstripped the concept of exclusively European international policies. Never before, perhaps, has the United Nations been better able to aspire to universality and to being an Organization which represents all continents.\n44.\tDespite the good omens that encourage understanding among nations there has been unleashed on the world a wave of terrorism which manifests itself in different ways and which in some cases assumes the proportions of virtual political aggression. This violence does not stop at the borders of the countries in conflict, but takes place anywhere in the world, which is tantamount to a continuation of belligerency on neutral soil and makes victims among the peoples of countries completely outside the battle. This singular trend of our day seeks the methods of terrorism to introduce this new form of war among nations. This was the case in the events that recently took place during the Olympic Games in Munich, whose tragic results shook all mankind.\n45.\tColombia condemns violence in any form whether it be personal attack, skyjacking, the taking of hostages, or collective massacres for all of them constitute a return by man to those eras which we had thought belonged to the past: the use of primitive means of violence to achieve political ends.\n46.\tThe Charter lays down principles governing normal relations among Member States and we do not believe that they can be applied differently when law, reason and right must prevail over instincts of violence.\n47.\tWe could never condone any type of attack or violence as licit forms of the struggle to solve international differences. Our civilization, already sorely beset by so many elements of violence, by individual crimes, by drug abuses, and even by the befouling of the air we breathe, will be even more seriously threatened and I would say doomed if those who practice sports, cultivate the arts and letters or proclaim peace are included among the belligerents in a conflict that is not of their making.\n48.\tBut all violence has a cause, and the United Nations cannot overlook the fact that one of the aspects of the conflict in the Middle East-the destiny of the Palestinian people-is still awaiting solution. The problems involved in that long war are many, and a careful study must be made of all of them, as well as of the possibilities for peace which Colombia advocates and hopes will be based on justice and equity for the countries concerned, as stated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which calls for the integrity of States within secure and recognized frontiers.\n49.\tTerrorism has also assumed the equally dangerous guise of skyjacking, whose stigma as a specific crime will remain a simple academic matter until a clear procedure for extradition which we still await is evolved. While there exist countries that serve as privileged sanctuaries to the kidnappers, this other type of useless violence will persist.\n50.\tSolidarity among all nations must be tightened in order to eradicate the use of terrorism as a political weapon, as well as other forms of violence. But this presupposes the widest possible exercise of the self-determination of peoples as the guiding and basic tenet in the life of nations. The very Charter of our Organization sets forth this principle.\n51.\tColombia has defended ideology and even economic plurality as facets of a policy of tolerance and respect for the self-determination of peoples regarding the choice of their own systems of government, and we feel that an effort that has been neglected for over 10 years that of determining of rights and duties of States should be resumed in order to draft a treaty to complement our Charter, which has left many blanks in the clear-cut definition of the true rights and duties of all States.\n52.\tColombia is firmly convinced that self-determination of peoples is the key to peace, and its denial the beginning of war. Intervention is another ancient aspect of international life that has become anachronistic, now that powerful nations which fought in the last World War and which today represent different ideologies are tied by links of friendship and the Organization has approved so many declarations on peace and the rights of States by universal consensus.\n53.\tMore than 60 nations that were mere colonies during the last World War have since become emancipated, and this process is irreversible and cannot be stemmed or interfered with by interventions that create fictitious situations. So the war in VietNam cannot be left as a war, with neither end nor victory for either of the belligerents until the right of self-determination of that people is fully recognized.\n54.\tNew generations know well that war pays no dividend and that in a nuclear age it is as dangerous as to play with fire in an ammunition dump. Strictly local wars are a thing of the past, and whenever they may occur there is the inevitable fear of their spreading and of the indefinite continuation of the conflict where both troops and civilian populations suffer equally.\n55.\tWar today is more cruel and destructive than before because of the sophistication of the weapons and the use of chemical and technological means for the extermination of the adversary. Today the entire nation is the battle field the nation with its open cities, its industrial complexes, its irrigation networks and its crops. \\\"Total war\\\", which in 1914 seemed an apocalyptic nightmare, has today become an everyday reality, a more harsh and cruel reality for those masses who are not to blame for living so close to the inferno. Thus we wonder whether the lessons of Korea today on the way to unification might not serve as a blueprint for the two parts of Viet-Nam which, after more than 10 years of destruction and scorched earth, lies desolate and wasted as the result of a war which General de Gaulle foresaw would leave only the dead, without victors or vanquished.\n56.\tThe world in which we live is in essence a plural society in which no other stand is valid but that of the full recognition of the tangible and visible reality of the existence of a multiplicity of political and social systems.\nColombia has understood this fact and entertains relations with Governments of the most diverse ideologies and social disciplines, with the single and special understanding that none will interfere in our domestic affairs, as we would not interfere in those of others. For many years the Latin American regional system has been based upon precisely this recognition, as we stated during the visit to Bogota of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile, my eminent friend Mr. Clodomiro Almeyda, when we proclaimed the need to recognize ideological diversity.\n57.\tThe political regime of no country can be an export-able commodity. If we admit this irrefutable fact of our day, we will have made significant progress towards the building of a new international order characterized by mutual tolerance, respect for human rights and the general exercise of the right of self-determination of peoples. We must transfer to the international arena the same evolution that has taken place within the democratic and representative state, where parties coexist as organized elements for political and public action within the framework of the law.\n58.\tThat same pluralism is carried over into the field of economics. The variety of systems in the world also applies to economic and social matters; and international organizations must start with the premise that their primary task is to build bridges between different types of society. World exchange is necessary among all countries for, when all is said and done, we live in a society in which progress must be intensively speeded up in order to cope with \\\"revolution of rising expectations\\\" which is occurring everywhere.\n59.\tColombia has been following this practice and applying it constantly to our relations with other continents and in our own Western hemisphere, where, with the countries of the Andean region, we are making headway in our experiment to integrate our economies and harmonize our economic practices in order to make joint plans to do away with tariffs simultaneously and to set our common industrialization targets.\n60.\tGenerally speaking, international treaties and agreements must be able to withstand the acid test of changes of government, for they cannot be considered as applying to specific persons or parties, ceasing to exist when these disappear, as were the family agreements of the monarchic period of Hie eighteenth century.\n61.\tAn era of negotiations has, in fact, dawned in relations between the great Powers, quite in keeping with the system which we have termed the triangular system of world decisions. Those negotiations have borne visible fruits in the relations among those great Powers and obviously they have a beneficial effect on peace.\n62.\tThe triangular system is extremely restricted, extending to a very few nations, and overlooks the rest, the medium-sized and smaller countries. Special envoys are reminiscent of the diplomacy of the last century, when there were no world or regional organizations of many ,nations linked by legal statutes establishing methods and ways of approaching the international problems and the means of solving the differences among States. Chapters VI and VII of the San Francisco Charter, which deal with the peaceful settlement of disputes and actions to be taken in case of threats or breaches of the peace or acts of aggression, seem to have been shelved. Excessive pragmatism on the part of the great Powers in the handling of world affairs has produced the strange phenomenon of the eclipse of the Security Council as the supreme body of the United Nations and the guide of the world political system as originally intended at the San Francisco Conference.\n63.\tThe immediate prospects for the United Nations are not encouraging. Progress towards peace is not paralleled by the same progress in international institutions. The San Francisco Charter is tending to be replaced by a system of secret negotiations among the powerful nations, and a new Charter of an exclusively political nature is being formed through tacit agreements among the great Powers, relegating the earlier institutions set up by the Charter to a secondary place. And thus in a few years we might well be confronted by two statutes, the nominal San Francisco Charter, and the more real and effective Charter elaborated by the great Powers.\n64.\tThis is a disturbing thing for the medium-sized and smaller nations, as has been recognized by our Secretary- General when, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, he notes that the United Nations has \\\"proved to be of limited value as an instrument of collective security\\\" [A/8701/Add. 1, p. 1J. Without over-looking the special responsibilities resting on the great Powers, the Secretary-General quite rightly goes on to state:\n\\\"The world order that we are striving to build in the United Nations must meet the requirements of such a society\\\" a world society, that is \\\"and any other system, however effective in the past, obviously cannot be acceptable, in the long run, to the peoples of the world. The interests, the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot, at this point in history, be ignored in any durable system of world order.\\\" [Ibid., p. 2.]\n65.\tThe United Nations is limited by the circumstances that I have mentioned and, particularly, by the exclusive interplay of the interests of the great Powers themselves. Surely, we do not lack principles nor do we want for basic norms for peace but we are simply faced by the desire to consider them as nothing but a series of academic rules.\n66.\tWe do not for a moment imagine that we can alter that triangular system which rules world affairs at the moment. But we do believe that we should at least try to revise some of the basic aspects of the Charter of the United Nations. Colombia pledged its unreserved support to the United Nations from the very first years of the Organization's creation and, despite the limitations we have mentioned, we are still of the opinion that in the San Francisco Charter lie the keys to peace and to understanding among peoples.\n67.\tThe problem does not lie in new and solemn declarations of principle, but rather in a readjustment of out-mode procedures and models of conduct. No social organism can permit itself the luxury of immutability or of staying on the sidelines while great changes in the structure of countries and in the physiognomy of continents take place and when basic modifications in the technological capacities of mankind occur.\n68.\tOne indispensable condition for the correct functioning of United Nations institutions is that the idea of disarmament should be made a reality. While countries of all the continents spend the astronomical figure of $200,000 million a year on armaments, as U Thant, then Secretary-General of the United Nations, pointed out not many months ago, no thought can truly be given to the full implementation of the legal processes established in San Francisco for the solution of international disputes that lead to so-called local wars.\n69.\tThe excess of armaments in the world is one of the main obstacles to, the true fulfillment by the United Nations of its political and universal mission and it is one of the reasons for the survival of poverty and misery in many parts of the world. With an annual investment of $200,000 million, a considerable restriction is placed on the amounts that could be assigned for peace and the progress of the hungry, the illiterate and the disease-ridden peoples.\n70.\tIn the Organization of American States, Colombia has raised the question of the need, even on the smaller scale of Latin American armaments as compared with those of the great Powers, of laying down proportionate yardsticks to avoid increasing unnecessary military expenditures.\n71.\tDisarmament is the corner-stone of the edifice of the United Nations. Any revision of the Charter requires and presupposes this condition which is as imperative for the great Powers as it is for the medium-sized and small States.\n72.\tApart from the above, the basic Colombian idea can be summarized as the desire to eliminate outdated provisions of the Charter such as the mention of \\\"enemy States\\\" in Article 53, which resorts to a language that dates back to the Second World War of more than 30 years ago.\n73.\tWe also believe that the powers of the Secretary- General, according to Article 99, should be strengthened. In this way, he would be able not only to \\\"bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\\\", but also to ask for the convening of a meeting of the Security Council whenever he deemed it appropriate. Because of his special experience and responsibility, the Secretary-General should be endowed with the power permitting him to call for a meeting of the highest body of the United Nations on questions of security and the maintenance of peace. We also seek greater decision-making powers for the General Assembly in the designation of the Secretary-General, allowing it to make a selection from a three-name slate submitted by the Security Council.\n74.\tOn more important matters, Colombia has suggested: The widening of the universality of the United Nations by making it a right for all States to become Members, rather than a favor, as it is at present; the consideration of a new category of \\\"Associated States\\\" in order to settle the problem of the so-called \\\"mini-States\\\", thus making it easier for such States to enjoy economic and social co-operation and even co-operation in the political field and in that of security while not imposing on them the burdens of membership, which might be too onerous for them; the revision of the rules of the Security Council so that the unanimity of all five permanent members is not necessary in the case of simple elections to fact-finding committees or bodies dealing with humanitarian problems; the establishment of a peace force that will not be a fighting army, but a body intended to give military assistance in order to prevent certain areas from being totally unprotected or to guarantee peace formulas between former combatants; the updating of the functions of the Trusteeship Council in view of the fact that now only two territories of only relative importance fall under its jurisdiction and that even these territories are due to achieve autonomy in the very near future, when the Council will have no further duties and could be entrusted with trusteeship over human rights; the consideration of a closer relationship between the International Court of Justice and the tasks of peace as well as the creation of specialized branches for questions of a regional nature.\n75.\tA special matter which should be discussed in the Assembly, in an endeavor to equip the United Nations to meet the needs of the times, is that of co-ordination between the many and varied existing economic organs. The proliferation of international organs is far too well known to require further comment, but the multiplicity of economic organs both inside and outside the United Nations does call for comment. The delegation of Brazil has proposed that the Economic and Social Council, expanded and reorganized, should become the equivalent of the Security Council on economic questions. In principle, my delegation and Government support that idea since it offers us an opportunity to ponder co-ordination among boards, conferences, commissions, bodies, all of which, in one way or another, deal with the same matters and come to different conclusions.\n76.\tThe United Nations was created when less than half the countries that today compose the third world were in existence when there was no hint of the claims submitted by the developing countries later at the three sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, held at Geneva, New Delhi and Santiago in 1964, 1968 and 1972 respectively. The changes that have since occurred have completely transformed the nature of the discussions on international trade and economy.\n77.\tTherefore, it should be only natural for the Economic and Social Council to serve as a body to co-ordinate and make decisions on matters within its competence without prejudice to UNCTAD continuing to be the forum for discussions between the industrialized nations and the third world.\n78.\tOne of the lessons that can be learned from the third session of UNCTAD is that the items to be discussed and dealt with among 140 countries of the most diverse economic capacities and geographical size should be more specialized.\n79.\tThe 22 items included in the agenda for the third session in Santiago were in point of fact an agenda not only for one, but for two, or even three, conferences of that type. The items were so extensive and difficult-items such as the trade and economic aspects of disarmament; the repercussions of environmental matters on trade; the present international monetary situation; the encouragement of exports; non-tariff barriers-and even one item that belongs more properly on the agenda of the Security Council: the closure of the Suez Canal.\n80.\tWe fear that these international conferences may easily lead to world-wide pandemonium, or to compromise resolutions that treat conflicting positions equally and refer them to study groups.\n81.\tApart from this, the questions raised at the third session of UNCTAD were all so closely linked to the international monetary situation, that, without a solution to the latter great problem, it is almost impossible to speak of doing away with barriers and obstacles to increased trade. An international trade policy is basically a policy of prices and of remuneration for labor in all 140 countries that were represented at Santiago. That fair-price policy for labor in the developing countries must take into account the monetary fluctuations of the great Powers and the lowering of the purchasing power which these bring about.\n82.\tThe disparities between the price system for industrial goods and the poor payment for raw materials are still all too obvious, and therein lies the major problem confronting the economy of the world.\n83.\tWithout dwelling on individual decisions of the third session of UNCTAD on the various items on its agenda, what was most notable there was the will of the countries of the third world to participate in bodies whose decisions affect their economies-that is, ultimately, the very fate of their peoples.\n84.\tThe bad precedent of a few and powerful countries possessing the power of decision on international monetary questions that affect all countries must be considered outmoded and should not be repeated.\n85.\tInternational democracy cannot be a mere skeleton- lifeless and still nor should it be only a literary subject worthy of mention at the inauguration of conferences and in welcoming speeches.\n86.\tThe developing countries are beginning to take a decisive part in the international discussions on the law of the sea, whose evolution had, until a few decades ago, been subject to the control of the more powerful and wealthy nations.\n87.\tNarrow territorial waters and freedom of navigation had been the ideal set-up for the great maritime Powers in order to ensure them unhampered entry into all seas and the exploitation of the oceanic wealth of all continents. That situation, so typical of the colonial enterprises of the nineteenth century had, as one of its mainstays, the three-mile limit that some countries proclaimed as a principle of international law. But colonialism is no longer a reality of our day.\n88.\tAs of 1945, and more noticeably since 1958, after the first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the developing countries conceived new formulas that constitute a trend towards reviving the rights of the coastal States\n8\nand their sovereignty over the wealth of the seas adjacent to their shores. This was due to very special situations which must be conceded by the great Powers, and among these was the need to protect the plankton that serves as feed for a great number of sedentary or benthonic species against the reckless exploitation and exhaustion of these resources.\n89.\tFollowing this line of thought, Colombia, together with 15 other countries of the Caribbean, formulated the doctrine of the patrimonial sea in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721, annex I, sect. 2], approved at the meeting of the Ministers of the Specialized Conference of Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea in June of this year. That doctrine is the most constructive and carefully weighed contribution made to date to find regional solutions on the basis of the existence of an economic zone and of the sovereignty of the coastal State over the exploitation of the resources of the sea adjacent to its shores.\n90.\tOur view is that the formula that is most closely akin to the legal realities of all continents is the one that recognizes an initial security zone, or territorial sea, of 12 nautical miles and an adjacent zone of primarily economic significance of variable widths up to 200 miles, depending on the width of the maritime areas and the location of archipelagoes in narrow seas like the Caribbean, where 200 miles cannot be drawn in all directions without infringing the sovereign rights of other States. The issue here is that those zones should allow freedom of navigation the jus communicationis and not become closed seas, and that at the same time, a unilateral proclamation should not infringe the sovereign rights of States with adjacent or facing maritime zones. We believe that those zones should be defined in international law, for we want to pass from the stage of purely unilateral declarations of claims by States to the stage of regional agreements governed by international law.\n91.\tColombia has been willing to have talks with other countries of our hemisphere in order to co-ordinate the different interpretations of the 200 miles in a regional agreement. This would be at a conference of the Latin American States that could at the same time serve as a preparatory conference for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to be held in 1973. Our attitude is one of international co-operation, but we realize that a new phase of this field of law has been reached by the emergence of clear economic needs.\n92.\tThe economic zones of the adjacent seas have even become a symbol of Latin American nationalism.\n93.\tThe number of items that will appear on the agenda of the forthcoming Conference are increasing considerably. Perhaps the authors of General Assembly resolution 2750 C (XXV), calling for the Conference in 1973, did not quite appreciate the universal scope and the great variety of problems that would arise because of the political and economic realities, scientific progress and the rapid technological developments of the last 10 years. Apart from the purely juridical and political factors that tend to modify the 1958 concepts on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas and fishing rights, there are now the problems of pollution of the marine environment and international co-operation in oceanic research. If we add to these the complex questions of the sea-bed, we find that there will be too many subjects for a single conference of limited duration to deal with.\n94.\tColombia wishes a program of work for that forthcoming Conference to be prepared here and now. It should not be impossible to envisage subdividing purely scientific questions, such as marine pollution and international co-operation in research, as well as certain aspects of the sea-bed, to form a special category of problems to be dealt with at special meetings within a co-ordinated work-plan, for the Conference must not become fragmented through a proliferation of items.\n95.\tOn the other hand, the other legal and political questions would be dealt with as a whole in a program of work that will avoid confusion in the debates on matters of a complex nature for which delegations will have to prepare themselves, first of all, to decide upon a policy for the sea and then, and only then, to take up the discussion of carefully prepared texts of articles or paragraphs of resolutions or conventions. In the discussion of the problems of the sea, priorities must be established.\n96.\tIn one word, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will have to set down criteria of its own on three main aspects: the expanded economic zones, the sea-bed and ocean floor, and the contamination and the ecology of the seas together with related scientific research. But at its present session, the General Assembly could make some progress with the organization of work.\n97.\tMy country has a consistent and lengthy tradition of compliance with international law in dealing with all foreign affairs problems. I do not believe I would be overstating the case if I say that our international conduct has always been clearly in keeping with the precise terms of law and of treaties. We do not believe that might makes right, or that violence and intimidation can be instruments of international policies. Our frontiers are clearly marked and we aspire to the territory of no other country.\n98.\tBecause of this constant principle of my country, we seek a more just world community governed by the norms and principles of. international law. We wish to see co-operation among States developing in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations not that we need principles and rules, but because we must have the will of all States to put them into effect. The international justice we advocate is not simply theoretical but is eminently practical, and is designed to find the causes of existing conflicts and to promote equitable treatment for the developing nations.\n99.\tThe myth of peace must, in this last quarter of the twentieth century, become the effective reality of peace. Despite its obvious shortcomings, the United Nations is still a good means of seeking that goal that is so ardently desired by my country and the immense majority of men and women of all other countries of the world. The sufferings of the war-torn peoples are the best justification for our appeal for peace in justice and law.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of Chile takes pleasure in congratulating this Assembly on its wisdom in electing you to preside over its deliberations. Your intelligence, tact and experience, which are necessary for such an important international post, have unanimously been recognized. Our pleasure is enhanced because there are strong ties of friendship and close co-operation between your country and my own.\n115.\tWe wish respectfully and warmly to salute the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim. We should like to convey to him our gratitude for his praiseworthy efforts to revitalize the United Nations so that it may more actively engage in the search for solutions to the many serious and urgent problems facing mankind today.\n116.\tThe Chilean delegation has considered with the greatest interest the Secretary-General's proposal for the inclusion on the agenda of this session of an item on terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l]. We have followed the debate on this subject with utmost attention. For reasons unconnected with the Secretary-General but having to do with the very nature of the phenomenon he has highlighted, the formulation of the item may be ambiguous and involve many contradictory issues, depending on the standpoint from which one approaches the problem. Hence the amendments that have been adopted and the need for a calm and exhaustive examination going to the very roots of the problem that each day assumes new and unforeseen dimensions.\n117.\tThe people and Government of Chile have expressed their sincere grief for the innocent victims of blind terrorism motivated by desperation, hatred or madness. Chile, whose Government rejects terrorism, is bringing about intensive social and economic changes within the free functioning of democracy. Nevertheless, as is well known to world public opinion, we have had to defend ourselves against international plots and sabotage that have tried to bring to our country coups d'etat, chaos and civil war. Had such sinister plans been successful, there would have been worse consequences for our people than international terrorism on a large scale.\n118.\tWe share the concern of many delegations that it might be possible, given the imprecision and vagueness of the term, to describe as terrorists the heroic fighters against colonial exploitation and shameful racism or those who legitimately rebel against oppression, injustice or poverty. Similarly, we should not like to see the adoption of measures against terrorism signifying an international coalition of reactionary forces against the progressive forces of mankind, nor should we like to see provisions hastily arrived at that would actually undermine the institution of the right of asylum, which has been upheld by Latin- American juridical traditions and has been an unchanging norm in the republican history of my own country.\n119.\tMany of the causes of terrorism would be eliminated if there were respect for the principles of the Charter and self-determination, if there were no violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and if a responsible approach were taken to the tragedy of the growing impoverishment of the developing countries which, instead of being given co-operation, are being pillaged, boycotted and driven to desperation. The delegation of Chile is ready to participate in the examination of this item whose complexity should not be used as an excuse for not examining it dispassionately in all its aspects.\n120.\tMy Government believes that this session of the General Assembly is being held in favorable international circumstances, which augur well for a reduction of tension and the search for paths leading to real peace. Contacts and negotiations between great Powers, the beginning of dialogs which only a few months ago were difficult to imagine, and the emergence of a will to examine squarely the problems which constitute threats of hostility or confrontation have given birth to hopes which, we trust, will not fade or be disappointed.\n121.\tIt is a fact that by means of bilateral diplomacy the great Powers have made praiseworthy efforts to reduce their rivalries, thus making less likely a nuclear catastrophe. There are new prospects for disarmament, and there has been a reduction in the degree to which the world is divided into blocs. There is an increase in the possibilities of peaceful and active coexistence. There is emerging what the Secretary-General calls a new \\\"balance of caution\\\", which should replace the balance of power based on mutual nuclear terror, suspicion, rivalry and the arms race.\n122.\tWe welcome the rapprochement of the great capitalist Powers and the great socialist Powers. It would certainly yield positive results for humanity if the capitalist world would decide once and for all to put an end to the policy of the cold war and to realize that socialism is an irreversible historical fact which manifests itself in various forms in accordance with the special character of the country adopting it.\n123.\tWe take great satisfaction in the fact that there has been a normalization of relations among all European States and that a system of security which strengthens the machinery of peace, channels the energies of those States towards scientific and technological progress and extends the benefits of such progress to the whole of mankind, and in particular to the countries which most need it, such as those of the third world, has been consolidated in that continent. But we are convinced that the thaw in international relations, if it is to be genuine and promising, cannot be something which exists only among the great Powers or in certain highly developed areas. Tension and threats to peace, the desperate situation of millions of human beings who are suffering from malnutrition, illiteracy, exploitation and imperialist penetration, violent or covert, often lead to tragedy in other parts of the world, specifically in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where we witness wars and coercion and where there are no signs of relief. That is where there is no perceptible relaxation of tension.\n124.\tParadoxically, along with the improvement in international relations, the aggression in Viet-Nam continues, as does the conflict in the Middle East, the subjugation of peoples in Africa and the exercise of pressure by imperialism in Latin America. We recognize as a real and historical fact the existence of great Powers with sufficient might to bring the world to the brink of destruction or to guide it towards peace, security and progress. Those Powers bear a special responsibility towards the peoples of the third world, who have been kept outside the mainstream of the progress of civilization.\n125.\tIf a great capitalist Power decides not only to avoid confrontation with other great Powers, but indeed decides to extend and increase its co-operation and trade with them while insisting on continuing its imperialist policy of exploitation and aggression vis-a-vis small nations which are jealous of their sovereignty, the relaxation of tension may be positive, but it can only come to full fruition if it is extended to all the peoples of the world.\n126.\tThere is something else we should add. Bilateral diplomacy is of the utmost effectiveness, but the results attained would be more tangible and beneficial if they were consolidated through the collective system so patiently worked out by the United Nations on the basis of international law, which develops in accordance with the requirements of justice for the whole of humanity. Nevertheless, we must condemn here the attempts made to invalidate the collective system of the United Nations, to deny it the resources and the means for its organs to discharge their functions of assistance to developing countries or, in brief, to diminish the prestige of our Organization so that it cannot really and properly participate in the political, economic and social leadership of today's world, whose problems require fresh vision and new approaches.\n127.\t. My delegation cannot help referring to the tragedy of Viet-Nam. The Government and people of Chile reiterate their firm solidarity with the people of Viet-Nam, as well as with the peoples of Cambodia and Laos. We should like to express once again our condemnation of the bombings, the mining and the blockading of North VietNamese ports, the destruction of dikes and the so-called VietNamization of the war. An act of aggression is being committed against the people of Viet-Nam, which could be described as systematic and highly mechanized terrorism I repeat, systematic and highly mechanized terrorism which has produced innumerable innocent victims and has laid waste the entire country.\n128.\tThe peace in Viet-Nam so longed for throughout the world, longed for indeed by vast sectors of the public of the United States, can be achieved only by the total withdrawal of United States troops, the acceptance of the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, and the respect of the territorial integrity and self-determination of all the peoples of IndoChina.\n129.\tCertainly this General Assembly session, like so many others, will condemn colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and apartheid. The colonialist and racist countries continue to enjoy the support of certain Powers, in spite of resolutions of the United Nations. On the other hand, the resistance and liberation movements, which are opposed by modern armies and arms, do not enjoy sufficient support. It is impossible for Africa to realize its true potential for progress, unity and security, if in the southernmost part of that continent a colonialist and racist bloc is allowed to consolidate, a bloc which, with the complicity of imperialism, is entrenching itself and disregarding the agreements of our Organization.\n130.\tChile, as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, is following with great attention the contacts established between the Secretary-General and the Government of South Africa to clear the way for the final independence of the people of Namibia. However, we are surprised and disturbed at the fact that this Government, on the one hand, has welcomed the important initiative of the Secretary-General while, on the other hand, it pursues a policy of dividing the people of Namibia, persecuting its leaders and entrenching the evil system of apartheid, a crime against humanity which should of considered urgently in order to devise juridical instruments which would be binding on States.\n131.\tMy Government categorically supports the peoples of Africa fighting for independence and considers that the United Nations should intensify its decolonization activities, primarily condemning the colonialism and racism of Pretoria and Salisbury.\n132.\tStill in the field of decolonization, as far as Latin America is concerned we consider it a memorable event of the utmost importance that the Special Committee on decolonization  should have decided in favor of \\\"the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV)\\\" [see A/8723/Rev. 1, chap. I, para. 85].\n133.\tMy Government regrets.that in the Middle East there has been no progress towards a just and stable peace. Indeed, a distressing sequence of events has occurred, including the massacres at Lod and Munich and the armed attacks in Lebanon and Syria. The occupation of Arab territories continues; the Jarring mission is paralyzed; and no real efforts are being made to gain respect for the lawful rights of the people of Palestine. We trust that this Assembly will reach more effective agreements in keeping with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Our Organization should actively work to end one of the most distressing tragedies of our time and one of the most terrible threats to the peace of the world.\n134.\tChile is undergoing intense economic and social changes designed to remove the outmoded and unjust structures of a society based on exploitation and to achieve socialism. This is a process designed to eliminate our dependence on imperialist monopolies and finances and in this way to bring about complete national independence. We do not conceal our difficulties and the desperation and hostility of reactionary forces which cannot reconcile themselves to the loss of their privileges.\n135.\tIn two years the Government of Popular Unity in Chile has brought about substantial changes in the life of Chile. We have nationalized our basic resources, copper, iron and saltpeter. We have eliminated large estates. We have nationalized and democratized the system of credit by making our bank State-owned. We have made progress in the area of social ownership, and we have included in this system very important monopolistic businesses. We have provided new educational opportunities and we have extended protection to the mother and child. Above all, the working classes have assumed responsibility and enjoy participation at all levels of the State.\n136.\tChile's experience, considered as one of the great social experiments in the world, is being acquired in respect for the constitutional and legal norms of our country, democratic pluralism and the free functioning of opposition forces. Much has been written and reported about the Chilean experiment, sometimes objectively but at other times obscurely and misleadingly. However, Chile is a country open to anyone who wants to understand the tremendous importance of the historic phase our people is passing through. We have nothing to hide, nor do we fear criticism. We simply want people to deal with us without mystification or falsehood.\n137.\tOur foreign policy, rooted in the facts of our national life, is entirely in harmony with the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of this Organization. We have often given evidence in these two years of the Popular Government of faithful compliance .with principles such as non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect for the self-determination of peoples, human rights and peaceful coexistence, which transcend political or economic doctrines or systems.\n138.\tChile, which would appear to be cut off and remote because of its geographical position, has extended its network of international relations to all corners of the earth in the desire to establish bonds of friendship and cooperation with all peoples. Fundamentally, we proclaim that we belong to Latin America, and we are striving to achieve with all Latin American peoples not only profound friendship but genuine integration in various areas.\n139.\tOur feelings of belonging to Latin America have inspired us to do everything we can to bring about the integration of Latin America. We are ready to seek alternatives and new possibilities within the Latin American Free Trade Association. In this context, we attach particular importance to the strengthening of the Cartagena Agreement of 1969, in which, along with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, we have succeeded in establishing a subregional plan of integration, and the progress we have already achieved is virtually irreversible. This is an example of integration which will surely have an impact on the entire region in keeping with our common destiny as Latin Americans.\n140.\tWe are full members of the group of non-aligned countries. Our non-alignment is not directed against any great Power. It is simply against the division of the world into blocs or spheres of influence. We want to contribute to the establishment of peaceful co-operation in keeping with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations.\n141.\tWith regard to progress towards a solution of the questions relating to the sea, my delegation considers that this session of the General Assembly should play a particularly positive role. The decisions which it should adopt with regard to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and the opportunity it will give to continue during this decisive phase the necessary political negotiations, encourages my Government to hope that the world Organization will demonstrate in this field its potential for resolving problems of interest to all States.\n142.\tChile takes particular satisfaction in the progress achieved towards the formation of a political plan for a solution. My Government believes that the growing support for the concept of zones of maritime jurisdiction of up to 200 miles, with an economic content, contributes in large measure to this plan, which should take into account the aspirations for justice and development of all peoples. The recent announcements, to this effect, of the States of Latin America, Africa and Asia, strengthen the economic interest of the countries of the third world, an interest which should be fully safeguarded if we want to achieve a global international solution.\n143.\tMy Government is concerned at the fact that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limit of national jurisdiction which was solemnly declared in resolution 2749 (XXV) of the General Assembly, along with the resources of the zone, to be the common heritage of mankind may begin to be exploited, in contravention of this declaration and what was known as the moratorium resolution [resolution 2574 D (XXIV)]. \n144.\tChile has offered the facilities of its capital for the first session of the Conference, which it would like to be held in Santiago. I should like to express the thanks of my Government for the warm reception which this invitation received, in countries of all regions and systems, during the last session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. We are confident that this session of the Assembly will decide to accept the invitation. For Chile, a favourable decision would be a tremendous encouragement to its policy of negotiation and international co-operation, both in the Latin American sphere and on the world level.\n145.\tWe support the initiative of the Government of the Soviet Union in proposing as an item for this session the \\\"Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [A/8793]. We consider that an agreement on this subject, together with the convening of a World Disarmament Conference and the adoption of concrete measures to implement the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], will be positive contributions to the cause of world peace.\n146.\tWe oppose all nuclear tests, in whatever environment they are carried out. Chile witnessed with particular concern the continuation of the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in the Pacific Ocean.\n147.\tThe delegation of Chile has already had occasion to make substantive comments at the 1451st meeting of the Second Committee on the economic and social situation in the world and particularly on the external economic and financial relations of our country. Nevertheless, we consider it necessary to say, from this lofty rostrum, something about the principal aspects of our thinking with respect to these matters.\n148.\tIt is clear that the new manifestations of a relaxation of political tension also involve positive prospects for trade and economic relations at the world level. Nevertheless, it would be a bad mistake if these hopeful prospects were to reduce the deep concern over the world's plight brought about by the tragic economic and social conditions in which a large proportion of mankind lives.\n149.\tWe are witnessing events which are so dismaying to the third world that perhaps instinctively we tend to repose tremendous hopes in any positive sign offered to us. Our enthusiasm is great when there is some progress in the ruinous arms race, even though military expenditures continue to remain on the order of $200,000 million a year. We hear expressions of satisfaction at the steps taken to overcome the crisis threatening the world monetary system, although we are aware that this progress is very precarious and that it suffers from the fundamental shortcoming that in the formulation of the reform, which is under way, there is no part being played by the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China. It pointed out as an encouraging sign that in the last three years the per capita increase in production has reached a higher rate in the less developed countries than that recorded in the countries of the industrialized world, even though this fact clearly contradicts the projections of present trends, which show that there will be a continued increase, at an accelerated pace, of the widening gap between the standard of living of the third world and the standard enjoyed by the great capitalist, economic and financial Powers, which have already accumulated a disturbing proportion of the world's wealth.\n150.\tWithout doubt, one of the great problems of our time and the most critical and serious one which should be at the very forefront of the minds of world leaders is that created by the unjust international division of labour and the unjust distribution of income and the technological gap. Various studies have shown that if present trends continue, within 25 years the developed countries will be enjoying an income of more than $8,000 per capita per annum, while the impoverished masses-who by that date will number more than 2,250 million persons\u2014will be earning on the average less than $200 per capita annually, and 800 million people will have an income of less than $100 a year. This is a problem which affects individual lives as well as the peace of the entire world.\n151.\tThe crisis of international economic co-operation is so acute that it would appear that some political leaders of the great Western Powers would prefer in fact to overlook the problem notwithstanding their many statements at meetings of international bodies.\n152.\tWith regard to trade, some important countries show no sign whatsoever of keeping the undertakings formally made with regard to the application of a general system of preferences. In the area of international financing we do not see here either any compliance with the principle of transferring at least the equivalent of 1 per cent of the gross national product to the developing countries. And in important cases we even witness significant reductions in the indicators of transfer, particularly with regard to public financial co-operation. This is happening while conditions in which international financing is granted are becoming ever less favorable and hence are leading to an accelerated increase in the servicing of the external debt of the developing countries. These payments are at the present time exerting almost intolerable pressure on the balance of payments of many of our countries.\n153.\tTherefore my delegation considers that we should continue using and strengthening the instruments of international co-operation, particularly UNCTAD, whose third session we had the honor of playing host to in Santiago. In our view, this session, which was attended by more than 140 States, had the virtue of examining in depth the great problems of development and it proposed solutions which will be effective if the countries of the third world press for them in all international forums.\n154.\tIt was gratifying to our delegation, after having submitted to the Second Committee the evaluation and program of action prepared by the member countries of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination, to see that this evaluation and the statements made from this rostrum by the Foreign Ministers of Western European countries were very largely in agreement.\n155.\tHowever, within this overall framework, which is in itself disheartening, there are particular circumstances which make more acute the problems of the external economic and financial relations of the developing countries. Chile in the last two years has had consistently to, confront these circumstances and for this reason we want to lay special stress on them on this solemn occasion. I am referring to new threats to the development and sovereignty of peoples first constituted by foreign attempts at economic coercion, aided and abetted by multinational corporations which operate beyond anyone's control and exert pressure to produce political decisions in behalf of the greatest world capitalist Power and which, in their desire to exploit the developing countries, carry out all kinds of illicit actions whenever the developing countries decide to recover their natural resources or those sectors of their economic activity which are of fundamental importance for the well being of their peoples.\n156.\tThe Government of Chile has carried out the nationalization of its principal resource, copper, with the unanimous support of the country, keeping strictly within the framework of our domestic legislation in accordance with the principles of international law emanating from resolutions adopted by the United Nations. Chile has acted in all its relations with external private interests in strict compliance with equitable and non-discriminatory juridical norms.\n157.\tNevertheless we have been faced with brutal financial and economic pressure, pressure exerted by some of the corporations affected by the sovereign decisions of the people of Chile. In various international forums, particularly at the third session of UNCTAD and at the last session of the Economic and Social Council, we have denounced the actions of which we have been the victim. We have indicated that the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT), even before President Allende came to power, initiated contacts with the Government of the United States and proposed various measures for intervention in our country, including the launching literally of a plan for a campaign of economic terror. This same international corporation, the ITT, subsequently, while rejecting a formal offer from the Chilean Government, which was known to the Government of the United States, to the effect that its investments in the telephone company of our country would be compensated in accordance with international standards, presented to high officials of the United States Government an action plan which involved the economic and financial strangulation of Chile and the overthrow of the Government democratically elected by the people of my country.\n158.\tRecently, another multinational corporation, the Kennecott Copper Corporation, after being engaged in litigation for about a year with the Chilean State before the competent tribunal and because this tribunal did not grant its claims, initiated a campaign designed to obstruct free trade in Chilean copper in various markets, by means of public threats against purchasers of our copper and pressure exerted on commodity markets and brokers trading in this metal.\n159.\tThat was an attempt to prevent the people and Government of Chile from marketing its principal export product. Such actions violate the most elementary principles of international coexistence and, if not stopped immediately and responsibly by the Governments in question, will tend to create a climate incompatible with the kind of relations based on positive dialog which the Government of Chile wishes to maintain with the United States. Since over the past few days these reprehensible actions have been assuming even graver proportions, my Government reserves its right to raise these matters again in the General Assembly in the manner and at the time it deems appropriate.\n160.\tWe believe that there is an increasing awareness of the many serious problems arising both internally and in the sphere of international relations because of the actions of those large international corporations. Consequently, as we pointed out in our statement in the Second Committee, we hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will shortly, or in any event before the end of this session, report to us on steps already taken by the study group set up by resolution 1721 (LIII) of the Economic and Social Council, adopted by consensus, to study the role of multinational corporations and their impact on the development process, and also their implications for international relations, and to submit recommendations for appropriate international action.\n161.\tThe Government and people of Chile hope that the United Nations will soon set in train the appropriate measures to deal with the actions of the multinational businesses of which developing countries are the victims, and of which my country has been the principal victim without the international community having done anything so far to prevent such odious aggressive maneuvers. For its part my Government, in all international forums, will bring to the attention of the world, and will denounce, the attacks and subversive actions aimed at Chilean democracy perpetrated by those powerful imperialist interests.\n162.\tLast week the representative of Chile at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, stressed that international finance organizations should not be the instruments of the bilateral policy of any member country of those institutions. We mentioned there that it was a well-known fact that there existed differences between the views of my own country and those of the United States Government with regard to the process of nationalizing our basic resources. We added that, although this was a fact, it did not authorize the United States to exert its powerful influence in the World Bank to get that agency of the United Nations to join in what was being done to put financial pressure on Chile by suspending its loans to our country.\n163.\tWithin the discouraging framework of international financing for developing countries, perhaps one of the few positive signs over the past few years has been the strengthening of multilateral approaches and the expansion of the operations of international financing agencies for development, such as the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Nevertheless, today the persistent efforts of many countries to strengthen the multilateral approach of those institutions are very likely to be thwarted by the actions of one Government which is bent on utilizing those agencies as instruments of its own bilateral international policy. It is unacceptable that people should try to justify a reduction in that Government's bilateral public aid to the developing countries by arguing that it is due to a desire to channel as high a proportion of resources as possible through multilateral organs, and at the same time should try to impose on each allocation of resources to those organizations restrictions and conditions which prejudice their independence and actually undermine their multilateral nature.\n164.\tSince the coming to power of the Government of President Salvador Allende, Chile has received no new loans from the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank, agencies which up to that point had been granting an annual amount of financing to Chile on the order of $100 million. Clearly, this was not due to technical considerations, but to the decision made public by the United States to prevent such bodies from extending financial support to our country as a result of the differences of view existing between Chile and the United States over the nationalization of our basic resources.\n165.\tFor that reason we made the point at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that if some Governments were not capable of understanding the need to preserve the multilateral nature of international financing bodies it would be necessary to study new ways and means for them to acquire their resources: through compulsory contributions established according to the level of the gross national product of each country, or some other, similar scheme, in order to prevent a situation in which we find in each of the laws for the allocation of resources certain restrictions and conditions which in the final analysis only negate the international nature of those very organizations. We believe that here the United Nations also has an important role to play- particularly the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.\n166.\tIf we consider that there was an abrupt suspension of the foreign aid which Chile had been receiving during the 1960s from both public and private sources in the United States, as well as from international agencies of which Chile is a full-fledged member with all rights implicit therein; and at the same time, if we analyze the actions taken against our country by large international consortia, we cannot fail to recognize that Chile has been the victim of real economic aggression, which although it is less tangible than physical aggression, is no less reprehensible.\n167.\tThe balance of payments of Chile has been in a very difficult situation recently. This is due to the suspension of financing from certain external sources which have been traditionally available to Chile, and to a sharp drop in the price of copper and an increase in the imports which have been occasioned by great industrial activity and an increase in internal demand. Apart from this, another factor in our balance-of-payments position has been the increase in the international prices of products imported by Chile.\n168.\tIn the face of this situation, our Government, in order to maintain the normal functioning of the economy and, at the same time, to ensure payments for the servicing of the external debt to all our creditors, in accordance with the actual resources and possibilities of the country, decided at the end of last year to proceed to a renegotiation of this debt. The servicing of the external debt represented in 1972 an amount higher than 30 per cent of the value of the country's imports.\n169.\tWe should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Government of France for the important task that country has been carrying out as coordinator of the so-called Paris Club, through which last April a general agreement was reached to renegotiate the servicing of the debt for this year. Similarly, we are pleased to say that bilateral agreements have been reached with most of Chile's creditor countries, in accordance with the terms laid down in the general agreement of the Paris Club. At the same time, may we say that it is our desire to sign bilateral agreements as soon as possible with the other countries with whom we are at present negotiating. We hope, furthermore, that in the bilateral talks with our principal creditor country there will be no attempt to bring up issues which have nothing to do with the nature of those financial transactions, since this would only serve to hold up the settlement we all desire.\n170.\tAs the beginning of a new spirit in international relations is now perceptible we believe that the United Nations should be considered to be on the threshold of a new period of history. It must therefore be made a more dynamic instrument capable of meeting die needs of today's world. My delegation would like to stress that a real threat hangs over our Organization: people are trying to destroy its power, to drown it in fictions and deprive it of the authority which it must have in order to speed up the liberation and progress of the peoples of the third world.\n171.\tNo one can ignore the work done by the United Nations, but we should not underestimate the impatience and the skepticism of vast sectors of world public opinion over the passivity and ineffectiveness which the United Nations sometimes displays in its handling of the urgent and burning issues facing mankind.\n172.\tBut since the United Nations is not a super-national organization, nor does it have any autonomous powers which it can assume outside the body of States which compose it, its full authority can only be brought to bear through the determination of all its Members to respect common obligations and to take collective action, by taking up within it the tragic problems afflicting mankind, by making its working methods more flexible, by increasing its financing capacities and by broadening its power and action.\n173.\tThe United Nations has made progress with regard to the matter of universality, particularly with the inclusion of the People's Republic of China something which was so indispensable for our Organization but there still remain nations and peoples which should come into the United Nations as soon as possible. My delegation would like to mention particularly the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. Both German States are indispensable components of a system of European security. Their scientific and technological achievement are extraordinary and their participation in the United Nations would be a powerful shot in the arm. We should also like to mention Bangladesh, divided States like Korea and VietNam, and peoples who possess a national identity, but have not succeeded in becoming nations or States due to their subjugation to the colonial yoke.\n174. Thanks in large measure to the action of progressive farces, the United Nations has succeeded in containing many crises; it has contributed to the independence of many peoples; it has promoted juridical, economic and social progress. But now more than ever we have the duty of strengthening the United Nations until responsible international conduct becomes the norm, until selfish interests ire set aside, until neo-colonialism and imperialism are done away with, until, in a word, a new form of international law which is at once more just and more effective is enshrined.\n175. The Government of Chile expresses its confidence that this session of the General Assembly will work in a spirit of understanding, with a firm and renewed will to reach agreements which will actually be carried out and make a genuine contribution to the struggle of peoples to enjoy full justice, peace and human dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "My first words are to congratulate you, Mr. President, most warmly on behalf of my Government and my delegation on having been unanimously elected President of the General Assembly, one of the most honored and responsible posts in the United Nations. Your past activities and your guidance of this debate, as well as the very thought-provoking speech you delivered immediately after your election to the post, indicate most emphatically and objectively that this year we have a firm and widely experienced guide with an open, understanding mind capable of sorting out the difficulties and problems which loom over the present session of the General Assembly.\n98.\tIn years past my Government has defined its position with regard to many concrete problems of international politics. Hardly any of the matters which arouse interest, debate and even passions have been omitted from our analysis. Since my Government maintains an unaltered position on the items which appear on our agenda in one session after another, we need not this year reiterate those points of view and approaches which we have sufficiently explained and reasoned out. That silence, however, in no way lessens the due consideration which my Government gives to the many items on the approved agenda in plenary meetings and in meetings of the main Committees. We shall have the time and opportunity to define the points of view of El Salvador regarding the new circumstances and the process of evolution of the old problems.\n99.\tUnlike individuals, international organizations have no definite coming of age. It can be affirmed that the United Nations was born big, developed vigorous, as measured both by the Charter and by its numerous world-spanning technical services. And yet, the sum of experience is important to guide, reorient and sometimes readjust the programs and policies which carry out these objectives, particularly in international organizations. In fact, while international organizations maintain the objectives which have been set, it is necessary to promote an adjustment to circumstances and to re-evaluate the complex set of initiatives and means of implementation and, in general, of executive policies. While the Charter is set and crystallized, the means to apply it and, more importantly, to make its purpose a reality are open to inventiveness, determination and the sense of responsibility of governments.\n100.\tThe United Nations came into being at a time when the need to rationalize international relations was obvious, and to some extent it responded to that idea so far as international peace and security were concerned. It was conceived, thought out, structured and endowed so that, on the basis of certain assumptions, which have frequently been lacking, it would guard world peace and security.\n101.\tAs intermediate activities which condition peace and security, the Charter listed the promotion of development, the observance of fundamental human rights, the reassessment of international relations by means of standards of justice. Withal, in the terms of the Charter, these objectives jointly condition and consolidate peace and security, which constitute the reason for the existence of the Organization.\n102.\tOn the basis of the Charter itself more emphasis could be placed on the aspects in which the United Nations could be more meaningful, since it is a matter of common knowledge that the basis of its incomparable strength in regard to peace and security has been weakened by antagonisms in the Security Council. Therefore we could reassess international relations from the point of view of justice and from that approach consider the problems of under-development and their solutions, the terms of trade, the transfer of technology and regional integration.\n103.\tAlthough some problems can be solved if treated in bits and pieces very pragmatically, it would seem appropriate to undertake an overall study, at least' at certain moments in the life of an international organization. That overall review would make it possible not only to reconsider program priorities in connexion with the four or five basic objectives of the United Nations but also to analyze the viability of the policies adopted, the solutions applied and, in general, the whole structure, activity and internal and external co-ordination of the system.\n104.\tThat something has to be done to give strength and vigor to the United Nations seems clear; that the United Nations is undergoing a crisis of credibility in public opinion is recognized in official and private circles in many countries. But that the Governments which sustain this Organization have the firm and urgent duty to analyze the course traversed and assess the degree of fulfillment of the Charter and in particular to examine the distance between the objectives collectively agreed to and the political events of recent years seems a measure of prudent governing. From being very pragmatic we are becoming immersed in detail; from being very positive, we lose sight of reality; from being so aware of the immediate problem we are forgetting that what is immediate is part of a lengthy process. If in national States we think for several years ahead, it is strange that international organizations should live from day to day and draft their agenda year by year with frequent repetitions and without defining the major goals which would make it possible to assess and evaluate administrative activities, technical assistance and political achievements.\n105.\tThe United Nations Charter registers the objectives and principles of conduct which are compatible with the survival of national States; but it is not a program, nor does it present a strategy, and it is precisely there, in the program and the strategy, that the executive powers have much to do. Through the global strategy and the programs, the purposes of the Charter can be reconditioned and, by their interaction, we can reassess international relations on the criterion of justice. That reassessment on the criterion of justice, although veiled, is in the Charter; through the strategy and the program we can make explicit what is implicit in the Charter and transform into reality what is now but a seed.\n106.\tThe two world systems of organization so far known that of the League of Nations and that of the United Nations came into being immediately after catastrophic wars and reflected the conditions prevailing at the time. Since every written regime becomes crystallized, the Charter has constituted a recourse for those who want to give a summary, scanty, restricted interpretation of the obligations contracted; but from the same instrument one can adopt an executive, broad, dynamic and even ambitious meaning, for which what is required is neither more nor less than a genuine political will. There would be an opportunity within a global, largely political, review of the existing system, and we urge that the will to do this be aroused among all so that they may agree on a global and dynamic plan of action.\n107.\tEvery agreement that is written into norms is a novelty at the time of its creation, but its later effectiveness depends on the way in which it is managed; then it becomes a force of containment, instead of being used as an instrument of progress. At the international level, in order to keep pace with the accelerating forces of change, proposals are frequently made to revise legal instruments, and then renegotiation is barred by fear sometimes, indeed, by terror at innovations, and in the present case with mistrust among the centers of power, which within the established system, represent the vested interests. Thus we observe the fate meted out here to the very praiseworthy proposal to amend the Charter; it is shrouded in purely procedural resolutions, with nobody so far, being openly opposed.\n108.\tParallel with the reform of the Charter, and without constituting either an obstacle or a proposed substitute, one can consider the bringing up to date of the United Nations system by an overall review of intermediate objectives and purposes, programs and services, and ultimate goals. The activities of the General Assembly are scattered and unconnected in annual programs which meet episodic and passing circumstances. The agenda could contain the basic items of the strategy for the implementation of the Charter. For 27 years the United Nations has avoided an overall review of its activities and has refrained from drawing up a strategy which combines a sense of timeliness with the major objectives of the Charter: peace and security, international justice, development, human rights, regional co-operation.\n109.\tThe United Nations cannot attain its full relevance without a new disposition of power politics, not only in the strictly political field but also in the economic field. Otherwise it will continue to be the stage for the balance of the great Powers, with of course all the splendor required by the technological era. If there is a real desire to attain the ends, the proper means must be supplied, otherwise to desire the ends becomes a romantic or political recourse. The seriousness of declared purposes is measured by the adequacy of the means supplied.\n110.\tIt has been said that if the United Nations did not exist it would be necessary to invent it, which implies that without it the contemporary international community would be inconceivable. But we would add that were it to be re-created at this time perhaps it would be built with so much caution, so much mistrust, such a sense of rivalry, that its powers might be diminished. We agree completely with the proposals to amend the Charter. Such amendments must pursue a fundamental objective-namely, that of raising international justice to the level of a primary objective of the Charter with a status equal to that of peace and security.\n111.\tWe believe that this effort, although it is not destined to immediate triumph, will in time bring about results. The worst attitude would be one of conformity, that of giving in to an overwhelming, asphyxiating reality without a future, which tends to convert the mechanisms of the international community into a repetition of those which caused so much sorrow and so many irrational situations in the past. Knowing that in this case there is no immediate and definite expectation, we can only cross swords for what Should be, for that which is in line with a constructive collaboration between States, for that which leads to a new world order based on collective security, and on relations measured by justice, for that which leads to an international social policy. It is a matter of urgency to reassess internal relations by criteria of justice, that is to say, to transfer to the international level, mutatis mutandis, the sense of justice with which national contemporary States have readjusted and carried out their functions and consequently changed their image, structure and significance.\n112.\tWithin this reassessment one would have to rethink completely and from the very beginning-the problems of development and under-development on a world-wide scale, because it must be recognized that all the efforts and programs, which are good in themselves, have fallen short of expectations and that all policies of technical assistance, trade, transfer of economic and technological resources, investments and loans, and so on have proved to be insufficient although we do recognize that had such programs and policies been lacking the gap between the two groups of countries into which the international community is divided would have been far greater.\n113.\tSince development became a conscious and rational objective of the international community and it started with the United Nations system and the specialized agencies several means of development have been attempted, among which it is worth while to recall the following: first, multilateral technical assistance, the most outstanding exponents of which are the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research; second, financial assistance through banks and funds on a world-wide, regional and even subregional basis; third, the mass transfer of science and technology; fourth, private and public investments; fifth, world-wide trade arrangements by way of UNCTAD, which is one of the most valuable forums for developing countries. Today we are being sold another means, birth control, which some countries refuse to buy.\n114.\tWithout prejudice to the validity of what has been done and said, thought and planned, the fact is that the gap between the developed and the developing countries is widening, and this indicates that the means chosen have been inadequate as compared with the objectives, probably because those means have fallen short of the needs. The problem of development has never won complete and unwavering understanding among the developed countries; and so when after laborious negotiations what is deemed appropriate is obtained, it is already insufficient. That is what happened, for example, with the famous 1 per cent transfer of the gross national product of the industrialized countries. Tilings have their time and their reason, and postponements make inadequate that which was calculated for circumstances which have since been superseded.\n115.\tSome Latin American politicians, intellectuals and technicians have sponsored and disseminated a scheme for vertical regional development, which would mean that a group of industrialized countries would take charge of a group of under-developed countries so that both groups would be connected between themselves by means of exclusive tariff preferences and other benefits. This scheme, which would divide the world into vertical zones of close association between developed and under-developed countries, is conceived of as an alternative to find a way out of the deadlock in which this major question is being debated and in regard to which the development strategy of the United Nations has proved to be powerless. Within that theory a world-wide approach would be to some measure replaced by a regional approach.\n116.\tThis scheme has attractive points, but it is delineated within \\\"the means which have already been abundantly used to promote development and there is nothing to guarantee that if these means have been ineffective on a world-wide scale they would not be equally so on a regional scale. Furthermore, the distribution of the world into north-south sectors would increase the political dependence of the corresponding under-developed countries. The scheme could be freed from its political ambiguities if it were to go hand in hand with a profound revision of the machinery and habits of the exercise of power.\n117.\tIn the great world-wide interplay of interests the under-developed countries benefit from the existence of several power centers, with which they can alternately negotiate and in respect of which they will in some measure learn to benefit from their competition, not to say their dissensions. The bipolar structure of the last 20 years has offered less margin for negotiation than the quadri-polar structure, which seems to be what is going to happen in the last decades of the twentieth century.\n118.\tThe disorderly and irrational use of technology requires that we think of the destiny of man on his planet. The world of the future must be international and to a large degree transnational; but as long as there is no basic revision of the mechanisms of world power, the under-developed countries will have to use legal and political methods which have been somewhat superseded by time but which constitute their means of defense. Thus, despite growing interdependence, they will have to work with national States, sovereignty, the legal equality of States and the host of principles and doctrines which represent the international strength of national States.\n119.\tDuring this general debate the Assembly has heard the suggestion made at the 2050th meeting by the Foreign Minister of Mexico, Mr. Emilio Rabasa, that the underdeveloped world have a permanent seat on the Security Council, with the rights and the obligations provided for in the Charter. This idea should be retained and explored. Indeed, the under-developed world as a whole constitutes a considerable political force; its presence on the Council, with legal equality with the five great Powers, would introduce a healthy political balance in the United Nations. Some special rules could be examined: for example, the rotation of the countries designated, relatively lengthy periods of the exercise of that lofty position, and agreement on rules and criteria whereby the State representing the developing countries would make use of the prerogatives inherent in a permanent seat on the Security Council.\n120.\tIt is maintained today that we have to conceive of another model of development, very appropriate to the under-developed countries and different from that of the industrialized countries. This idea must be managed very cautiously because, while it might respond to the principle of being adjusted to the circumstances of time and place, which is very valuable socially, it could lead to the prolonged condemnation of a sector of mankind in regard to the advantages of the use of technology and deprive that sector of an active contribution to the great process of mastering nature and fully developing the potential capabilities of man.\n121.\tMuch may be said, but the fact is that the industrialized countries are only half convinced that the development of the less developed countries will objectively be of benefit to them. For i.hat very reason the industrialized countries have not come to consider that problem as their problem. Of course this attitude is consistent with the division of the world into national States, and perhaps it can be penetrated with a new alignment of States in the regions which are integrated. Part of the assistance pro-grammes has been subscribed to and maintained by not only political but also cultural and technical prestige and influence.\n122.\tGrowing interdependence is one of the dynamic characteristics of the contemporary international community, and some problems go completely beyond the capacity for decision and the power of national States, even of the strongest. One cannot create barriers and believe that indifference to what happens outside is in the national interest. There are no islands of prosperity, because problems transcend separatist and separating barriers and render any convenient indifference impossible.\n123.\tA few hours' flight south of the megalopolis of New York, the political center of the world because it is the location of United Nations Headquarters, under-development begins, with its entourage of frustrations and insecurities. It extends south on the American continent, and continues in Africa, Asia and Oceania. The causes of this phenomenon are not well determined and must remain a subject for studies on sociology, history, economics and politics. But as for its lasting character, one of the factors at stake though not the only one is the overwhelming attraction exerted by the great industrial cordon of the Northern Hemisphere, which, independent of the wishes and purposes of peoples and governments, increases and, within the law of social forces, is unfavorable to the weaker areas. Only an international social policy based on the sociology of the international community and directed by criteria of justice could reverse that trend.\n124.\tWorld trade unduly reflects power relations, and the imbalance in the terms of trade is a consequence of those relations. It is therefore quite normal, indeed, necessary, for the under-developed countries to strengthen their negotiating capacity by means of consultations and agreements so as to present a united front to the industrialized countries. Thus, the meetings of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination, better known as CECLA, the prior meetings of the under-developed countries in UNCTAD, the meetings of countries exporting coffee and other products are all meetings which, like those on coffee, are devoid of any character of conspiracy and are alien to the purpose of organizing cartels. Nor do they intend to distribute markets among themselves or to exercise pressure on them. Their role is to bring about order and to defend themselves, and definitely tends to compensate for the negotiating weakness of one of the parties in order to restore balance of treatment in dealing with the industrialized countries, which daily raise the prices for their technology, machinery and services, but are alarmed when there is an increase of a few cents in the prices of the commodities they purchase from the under-developed countries. It can be demonstrated that over a 15-year period those few cents, which are very uncertain because they fluctuate, creating illusion and despair, are very much lower than rises sustained without any known decline in the cost of industrial products and technological services.\n125.\tFurthermore, one must seriously consider an international division of labor and therefore the complementary character of regions so that each country will efficiently produce that which it is best fitted to produce. It should be left entirely to the under-developed countries to perform the economic activities for which their conditions are the best. Thus sugar and cotton, which some developed countries produce, paying subsidies to do so, and which they use to keep world market prices artificially low, should be the first products to be completely in the hands of the under-developed countries.\n126.\tInternational assistance for development has had a series of achievements, but also a number of deficiencies and gaps which it is time to evaluate. There has been insufficient emphasis on the human side that is to say, on education and training. Europe was able to recover rapidly after the Second World War because it had highly qualified human resources. The Marshall Plan was a success in Europe because of that human base. The United Nations and the specialized agencies, while they have worked to that end and for that purpose, have created important services, but could place even more emphasis on, and devote more resources and efforts to, education and training. It is well known that administrative and management skills are lacking in the under-developed countries.\n127.\tThe under-developed countries do not know how to utilize their most valuable resources human resources, which are undervalued today because of unemployment and low levels of knowledge and skill. Underemployment sometimes amounts to 50 per cent of the potentially usable labor force. That valuable resource, which is wasted in under-development, could to some extent be used in self-help programs.\n128.\tLocal training in administrative and managerial skills on a scale suitable to raise efficiency levels in all public and private activities in the under-developed countries combined with self-help programs, whose techniques would have to be disseminated on a broad scale, and with the assistance of the discovery and application of a methodology to provide incentives and motivation for the people, could generate the internal forces of development at an accelerated rate.\n129.\tIn the international community, which is ever smaller measured in relative terms because of faster communications, a phenomenon similar to development in national States occurs: absorbent areas make prosperity a privilege, even though it may be an undesired privilege, while at its expense the rest of the provinces vegetate. The provinces which vegetate continue to maintain the prosperity of the large cities and industrial centers, and the rural population, which traditionally lags behind industrial interests, pays its quota of sacrifices to maintain the cities. The underdeveloped areas of the world pay their quota in maintaining the high standard of living of the developed countries, even though that is not the result of deliberate policies or of any thought-out intention. Thus it is well-known that, among other things, the under-developed countries, with their squalid economies, help to pay for the unbridled and uncontrollable inflation of the industrialized countries; that monetary operations carried out without their knowledge or participation cause them serious disturbances; and that the policy of low prices for their export goods is one of the causes of their indebtedness, since they cannot maintain their programs with their exports, in other words, with the fruits of their labor.\n130.\tWith the case presented thus, it is apparent that under-development is not a problem which can be dealt with entirely at the national level, and that an international approach becomes indispensable. Under-development, influenced by the combined presence of different, closely linked economies, is a world-wide problem\u2014one for the United Nations and the specialized agencies. What is more, as some countries evolve from one category to another, the situation for the remainder will become even more difficult, and the need for a world-wide policy will be pressing. If matters are governed merely by social and political mechanics, in all likelihood under-development will become the mandatory fate of a large part of mankind and the euphemism of new models will then be sought.\n131.\tTrade will have to remain the major source of development-financing. This is definitely an improvement on indebtedness. This is not the case in unbalanced international trade, in which the unbridled inflation of the industrialized countries, which in some measure reflects higher salaries and better living conditions, has no appropriate counterpart. Therefore, it is really frustrating that, even if viewed with understanding, and although targets and wills were renewed, the third session of UNCTAD was little short of a failure.\n132.\tIt is time we gave thought to other ways of solving this world-wide problem by removing its causes and dealing with them and their consequences. I have in mind something which at this time of exacerbated pragmatism may appear to be purely Utopian, but of which much will be said in the future: international taxes. It may be predicted that one day such taxes will be paid on carefully selected productive activities, which will most patently show that many countries contribute to them, either by titular right, as in the case of the resources of the international sea-bed, or when businesses prosper and profits are earned with the contributions of many countries, as in the case of multi-national companies. When we speak of marine resources we refer not only to those of the international sea-bed, but also to biological resources. And since we have to start somewhere, the sea appears to be the most appropriate object of taxation.\n133.\tIn opposing international taxes, arguments similar to those against national taxes will be used: it will be said that they raise costs, discourage production, etc., but the fact of the matter is that national taxes do exist. They will also have to exist in the international community, even though they may now appear to be shrouded in clouds of Utopia.\n134.\tSome of the most acute conflicts of interest in the new regime of the seas could be attenuated if a really operative means of generalized co-participation could be devised in regard to these artificially distributed riches, since water, fish, plankton, tides, etc. recognize no boundaries. As the ocean is the main reserve of mankind, a coastal band could be drawn for the exclusive use of the coastal country, with some commitment to contribute voluntarily to an international development fund. There would then be an additional band for the exploitation of which a small mandatory contribution would be set, to be agreed upon between the coastal State and the international community. Finally, on what is called the high seas-which would cease to be the privileged possession of the first comer or of the strongest-a more complex regime of international co-participation would be established, and contributory levies would be set up by general agreement among all States.\n135.\tSince no world government exists, such a regime would function on the basis of treaties and, hence, through the centers which create international agreements, namely States; but as for management and administration, unless stagnation is the plan, a careful system of majority decision would have to be established-of course, without the right of veto-but by a well distributed and balanced majority.\n136.\tThese ideas are expressed within the framework of interdependence of interests and are therefore totally devoid of the concept of any gift. If it is really intended to organize the international community, one must observe the realities on which it is patterned. It is a matter of emphasizing education, training and skilled know-how, of studying motivation and incentive techniques, and of finding a reasonable international division of labour.\n137.\tEven the best technical and human plans will be relegated to the sphere of speculation if the international community fails to establish a minimum of security. Principles and rules for peaceful coexistence among States have been agreed to; but now groups outside the context of States, but whose conduct influences inter-State relations, are making their own law: the law of indiscriminate and irrational violence. The international community must defend itself from terrorism, which is poisoning international relations and wants to substitute the pressure of fear for the persuasion of reason; threats for negotiation; and desperate, passionate and insensate acts for the evolutionary process of institutions.\n138.\tThe United Nations is a world forum of great resonance; but it is also, and should continue to be, an organizing brain and, in some areas, an arm to give force to the Charter, which, to a large extent, is a set of goals and a handful of contractual obligations to ensure co-operation.\n139.\tThe United Nations has its intrinsic limitations; therefore its negotiations require two elements: time and patience. Without these two elements, one of which is objective and the other mental, the complex negotiations which it undertakes would lack maturity. In the negotiating process haste sometimes means delay, and the distances covered are not measured by a dose of impatience nor by improvisations.\n140.\tEssentially the United Nations is a great instrument for co-operation in fact, the most complex and extensive which is compatible with the survival of national States. For the present there is nothing in the international community that can replace it. We are firmly in favor of strengthening the United Nations at the political, economic and legal levels. We enthusiastically participate in its work and in its programs, and we realize that after several centuries of international relations governed by the law of force the process of institutionalizing the international community has to be comparatively slow. As Members of the United Nations, we take criticisms of the United Nations as criticisms of ourselves. The United Nations will go only as far as its Members really wish it to go. We are committed to a common task, called upon to influence decisively the lives of each and every one of its peoples.\nThat is why we reiterate our determination to work loyally and most actively for the attainment of the purposes of the United Nations. We do so in our desire for peace, motivated by our law-abiding spirit and our feeling of solidarity for and understanding of the problems and aspirations of the members of the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me to offer my sincere congratulations and good wishes to the President of the Assembly and to the Vice-Presidents who have been elected to guide the activities of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly. With their experience and reputation for wise counsel, I have no doubt that this session will prove as fruitful and beneficial as the others.\n157.\tPermit me also to express my delegation's gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, for the efficiency and diligence he has shown in executing his functions at the past session.\n158.\tOne could, with much justification, assert that the last session was characterized by a general determination to clear the air to clear the air not only in terms of the environment but also in terms of major issues of vital interest to the developing countries. I refer to the problems arising from the structure of international trade, the law of the sea-about which we shall no doubt be hearing more this session the admission of certain countries to the United Nations, the Rhodesian question and the situation in the Middle East.\n159.\tWe have followed very closely the proceedings of the First All-African Seminar on the Human Environment, held at Addis-Ababa from 23 to 28 August 1971, as well as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June 1972, which, in our opinion, constitutes a landmark in the history of post-industrial civilization and in the continuous efforts of man not only to conquer nature through science and technology but also to place science in perspective by critically evaluating its ethical and aesthetic aspects and directing science, not toward that uncertain progress that leads to alienation, destruction and meaninglessness, but towards the service of man and his environment. By so doing science would be not, as is commonly supposed, the antithesis of nature, but the mediator between man and nature. We believe that science and technology, when properly controlled and applied, can be of immense value in the rehabilitation of man-both industrial and developing man in the integration of the alienated individual into society, and in the search for new moral and aesthetic concepts, in keeping with a rapidly changing world.\n160.\tNaturally, we, the developing countries, were at first wary of the alarm sounded by the industrialized countries at the serious environmental problems that resulted from rapid and haphazard industrialization and urbanization, seeing it, perhaps wrongly, in terms of the rich having the leisure to tell the poor how to keep their gardens neat and trim. My Government has gradually come to the view, particularly after the Stockholm Conference, which laid down certain conditions of development, that there is much value and merit in the argument of the environmentalist movement.\n161.\tAs a developing country, it is our intention to avoid as many of the pitfalls and frustrations of development as possible. My Government has therefore taken steps, in co-operation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), to prevent pollution of our beaches by crude oil. and the dumping of oil in Gambian waters. Many of our beaches were polluted by crude oil last August, at the rate of one cubic foot per yard. We are in the process of becoming a party to international conventions relating to oil pollution damage and to the conservation of natural resources. We therefore welcome the proposed United Nations environment secretariat, and we hope that as many countries as possible will avail themselves of its services. The Gambia Government has also taken steps to seek advice from UNESCO on appropriate legislative measures for the protection and preservation of historic sites and monuments, and the machinery for the administration of these sites and monuments will soon be established. Planning and drainage problems of the urban areas have also engaged our attention, and it is envisaged that significant progress in these directions will be made in the next few years.\n162.\tMy Government, however, feels that, in view, of the possible conflict of interests between the claims of rapid agro-industrial development designed to raise the income and living standards of the population, and the equally valid claims of the people for the enjoyment of adequate social and physical facilities, the developing countries will require the financial and technical assistance of the United Nations agencies and other international bodies and the cooperation of foreign businesses and international corporations in the difficult but rewarding exercise of relating the pace of economic development to the preservation and control of the human and physical environment and reducing the mental-health and nutritional hazards connected with rapid change. We are therefore encouraged by the positive approach the Stockholm Conference has taken towards the problem of pollution and the human environment. That approach, in our view, has correctly identified the major environmental problems and outlined an integrated strategy involving population control, nutrition, education, drainage and sewerage, physical planning and natural resource management for the solution of these problems. Our only reservation, which, I believe, we share with some other countries, is that instead of creating a United Nations super-agency for the environment, we propose an environmental policy and co-ordinating unit within the United Nations Secretariat, responsible to a governing council which in turn would be responsible to the General Assembly. The specialized agencies, UNDP and the World Bank would continue the work of environmental control and the injection of environmental questions into development plans and surveys.\n163.\tThere is another type of pollution, however, which is far more dangerous and difficult to control or eliminate. This is the pollution of racism and apartheid. It is a pollution both of the mind and of the body and, more significantly, it threatens to pollute the conduct of international relations. It is a pollutant the removal of which has persistently dogged the efforts of this Assembly and all the devices known to civilized state-manship.\n164.\tWe spoke a few minutes ago of the policies and programs proposed by the international community to mediate the conflict between man and nature. The Stockholm Conference quite rightly drew the world's attention to the ravages which man's arrogance and steam-engine intellect have perpetrated on nature, with the resulting physical, aesthetic and psychological damage. Nevertheless, no damage can be greater or more dangerous than that caused by man's inhumanity to man, particularly when that inhumanity is based on economic deprivation, political oppression and a morally reprehensible and intellectually indefensible system of government. The racist minority regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury and their silent backers in the West-have, in defiance of all the appeals and resolutions of this Assembly and the Security Council, and in defiance of civilized opinion throughout the world, persistently and with mechanical monotony paraded before this Assembly the tragicomedy of civitas diaboli masquerading as civitas dei. We therefore propose that this Assembly should consider amending the Declaration of the Stockholm Conference to include world-wide economic and educational measures against racism and apartheid\n165.\tMatters arising from concerted international action against racism bring to mind the problem of Rhodesia. Sufficient time has now elapsed for all Member States to reach their conclusions on the findings of the Pearce Commission report on the so-called Anglo-Rhodesian proposals for a settlement. Before stating my Government's attitude to this new development, I should like to join my African colleagues in congratulating Lord Pearce and his Commissioners for their objectivity and their painstaking efforts in ascertaining the views of the majority of the Rhodesian population under very difficult and trying conditions. My Government is also pleased to note the United Kingdom Government's willingness to accept the necessity of this Commission in the first place, and for the \nmoral courage it has displayed in accepting the conclusions the inevitable conclusions of the Pearce Commission.\n166.\tThe Peace Commission report has not only underlined the unequivocal rejection of the so-called settlement proposals, but has also exposed the pretentions of the illegal Smith regime to represent the wishes of the majority in Rhodesia. The report has also made it clear that there should be no illusions about the achievement of majority rule in the near future. My Government has always held the view that the Anglo-Rhodesian proposals constituted a deliberate departure from the five principles of the United Kingdom Government. We are happy that this conviction has been vindicated by an impartial body. We are also pleased to note the United Kingdom Government's continuing commitment to sanctions as long as no reasonable prospect of an equitable settlement is in sight. While we support the United Kingdom Government's proposal for a \\\"time for reflection\\\" and for more time so that all parties to the Rhodesian conflict would, hopefully, be able to create the conditions for a modus vivendi, we are somewhat apprehensive that the political time-scale that may be envisaged by the United Kingdom Government could further contribute to the preservation of the status quo in Rhodesia. We believe that the United Kingdom Government, as the responsible Power, should take the initiative, at the earliest opportunity, in convening a meeting of the representatives of all shades of opinion in Rhodesia including the leaders of the banned African political parties to review the 1969 Constitution and to propose amendments or alternatives to that Constitution, with a view to establishing democratic political processes and a genuine multiracial society as a basis for the independence of Rhodesia.\n167.\tTime is useful for those who believe in the peaceful and democratic resolution of conflicts. It is, however, a serious error of judgment to allow dictators and racists too much time to spread their totalitarian tentacles further. It is precisely the political dividends of time, and therefore of growing confidence abroad, that the racists of southern Africa hope to reap. For this reason, we, the African countries, through the Organization of African Unity, have called upon the United Kingdom Government to convene a constitutional conference, guarantee the free expression of political opinion in Rhodesia, and provide the granting of universal adult suffrage by secret ballot for the population of Rhodesia as a whole.\n168.\tHaving outlined our position on Rhodesia, I now move from the local politics of inequality to the international economics, and politics, of inequality. Even before its meeting in Santiago in the spring of 1972, the third session of UNCTAD, was viewed with some justified pessimism by the developing countries. If its task was, in the words of its Secretary-General, Mr. Perez Guerrero, \\\"to bring about a reversal of prevailing tendencies in international decision-making and to translate the awareness of the development problem the central issue of our time- into convergent policies concerning trade, aid and related areas,\\\"  then in our view, this was not accomplished at Santiago. It could not be, particularly as certain countries chose to make it their duty to give us lessons in the efficient management of our resources, some going so far as to question the necessity of international commodity agreements. Internationally, therefore, we are still in the age of charity.\n169.\tWe do, however, share the concern expressed at UNCTAD's third session over the question of linking special drawing rights to additional development assistance. As a developing country, we are also concerned with increased freight rates and maritime transport costs, as well as with comprehensive international agreements on primary commodities. Our continued development to a large extent depends on the efforts of the international community to reach agreement on equitable solutions to these development difficulties that have engaged the attention of the UNCTAD secretariat. In this connexion, my Government also welcomes the forthright manner in which the importance of expanding trade links among the developing countries was pointed out in Santiago. We believe that the lessons learned from successive UNCTAD conferences since 1964 ought to lead to the inescapable conclusion that whatever UNCTAD may achieve, whatever breaches the developing countries may succeed in making in the protectionist wall of the rich nations, in the final analysis the problem of the economic emancipation of the developing countries is a problem only they can solve through their own united efforts and strategic economic choices. The salvation of the developing countries, we believe, cannot but be most materially assisted by the developing countries themselves and by economic methods and choices peculiarly suited to the realities of the developing world.\n170.\tI have done no more than provide a summary of my Government's policy on various issues of the day. AS a developing country and as an African country, Gambia's major concerns are trade and development, the effective prosecution of the struggle against racism and apartheid, the equitable sharing of the resources of the sea in the light of the special needs of the developing countries, the improvement and control of the human environment without prejudice to the rapid economic development of the non-European countries, and international security. These issues will no doubt engage the attention of this Assembly, and it is my Government's hope that our deliberations here will result in collective action and in the harmonization of views and policies for the resolution of these problems in the interests of mankind and in the cause of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.\n30.\tMr. President, it is my privilege, on behalf of my Government and delegation, to tender to you our congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n31.\tI cannot let this occasion pass without expressing my deep gratification for the efficient and serene manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, conducted the work of the previous session.\n32.\tIt also is most appropriate at this juncture to greet our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has indeed distinguished himself not only in his country but also in the international field. We sincerely wish him success in his highly responsible post, which requires constant vigilance and dedication in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n33.\tMuch as we welcome the relative state of detente amongst the major Powers, we remain concerned that the foreign policies of States, large and small, are still predicated upon the basis of balance of power and spheres of influence, a policy which has changed little since the founding of the United Nations. To clarify this statement, I venture to say that quite often we find that justice and equity are subordinated to paramount national interests.\n34.\tIn illustration of what I mean, I only have to cite the tragic situation in the Middle East, of which this Organization has been unremittingly seized since the right of self-determination, a corner-stone of the Charter, was flouted in 1947 and continuously thereafter.\n35.\tThe mere fact that the neighboring Arab countries became involved in the conflict brought about by hordes of immigrants of foreign national origin does not, and should not, make us forget that the indigenous people of Palestine have a distinct personality, and although many of them were dispersed outside the borders of their land, they have not for a moment lost their national identity.\n36.\tIt was to serve the interests of certain great Powers that the usurping State of Israel was created by pressure and immoral maneuvering at the second session of this same General Assembly, in 1947.\n37.\tIn this connexion I would like to recall what His Majesty King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz declared, word for word, during the 1947 session of the General Assembly:\n\\\"Remember that in the preamble of the Charter you have pledged before God and history that you would stand firm against the aggressor and direct your effort to establish world peace and international security. Is not what is being attempted in Palestine a case of flagrant aggression? Is it not tyrannical that an international organization is intervening to partition a country in order to present a part of it to the aggressor? \\\" \n38.\tIn spite of all this, the Charter of the United Nations was disregarded, and Palestine was partitioned by immoral and arbitrary pressure, which enabled Zionist immigrants, mostly victims of Nazi and other European persecution, to establish themselves in Palestine, thanks to the British Mandate.\n39.\tEven the British, who pursued an equivocal policy of \\\"divide and rule\\\" during their perfidious Mandate, imposed on the Palestinians without their consent at Versailles in 1922-thereby setting aside Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations-and who were the benefactors of Zionism, were themselves the victims of Zionist terror.\n40.\tWho murdered Lord Moyne? Who hanged British Tommies from trees in Palestine? Who blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem and tried repeatedly to kill the British High Commissioner in Palestine, Sir Harold MacMichael, and succeeded in wounding him? Who murdered Count Folke Bernadotte and his French assistant in Jerusalem?\n41.\tAnd have we forgotten the highly organized Zionist terrorist gangs such as the Irgun Z'vai Leumi, the Stern gang, the Haganah and other splinter terrorist organizations, acting in concert or independently?\n42.\tAnd who can forget the massacre of Deir Yasin, whose population was subjected to total genocide? It was that horrible massacre which terrorized helpless people and forced them to leave their homes, thereby enabling the Zionists to establish themselves in Palestine.\n43.\tNo one, including ourselves, condones terrorism and acts of violence; nevertheless, we note that some circles believe that a people like the Palestinians, struggling for their freedom and inalienable rights, should abide by certain rules and regulations which are observed in conventional warfare. But it is precisely because the United Nations was paralyzed by Zionist arbitrary actions against the Palestinians that many of those Palestinians had no choice but to go underground to fight in a manner not dissimilar to that which had been adopted by Zionists in order to attain their goal.\n44.\tLet me assure this Assembly that Palestinian organizations are not accountable to any Government\u2014Arab or non-Arab and nobody can compel them to disclose their secret plans. Furthermore, the Arab Governments are not responsible for what the Palestinians have undertaken to do. Therefore, any false accusations thrown at Arab Governments of promoting Palestinian operations are, indeed, malicious in the sense that those accusations are calculated to cover extensive aggressive acts against certain Arab States.\n45.\tI do not think that the world should forget the recent aggressive acts perpetrated against our Arab lands. I would mention the bombardment of the region of Abu Simbel in Egypt, inhabited only by civilians, and the Egyptian school in Bahr Al Baqar which was destroyed, with all its innocent children murdered. What about Zionist aggression against Beirut Airport and the destruction of all the civil aircraft there?\n46.\tBut have such treacherous acts ceased to threaten the security and stability of the region? We have only to recall the recent Zionist invasion of Lebanon, during which hundreds of innocent women and children were killed or wounded. How can we forget the continuous acts of aggression, including the usurpation of Syrian and other neighboring territories, which are still being subjected to Zionist aerial bombardment, without sparing towns, mosques, churches and even bridges which are vital for the livelihood of people dwelling in small towns and villages?\nAnd how can we forget the Holy Places, revered by hundreds of millions of Moslems and Christians as a legacy of mankind, which have been desecrated by the Zionists? All this has happened while the whole world has been aware of it but has not, however, taken the least initiative; nor do the people of the Middle East ever hear a murmur of protests about, or condemnation of, such desecrations.\n47.\tBut when a small group of individuals, driven as they are by sheer despair and bitter frustration stemming from their tragic situation, takes action against another group, the whole world is thrown into commotion and voices cry to the high heavens but no attempt is made to find out the underlying causes which led to such tragic events. Why are not similar voices raised when hundreds nay, thousands of innocent people are killed in various regions of the world as a consequence of the acts of those who seem to ignore the United Nations Charter, which was meant to bring justice and equity to all mankind without any exception?\n48.\tIt is, therefore, up to the United Nations to rectify the gross error committed in 1947, by recognizing the people of Palestine; and also, instead of mollifying the Zionists, the United Nations should bring pressure to bear on them to accept a solution which would take into account the collective will of the Palestinian people. Otherwise, there will never be peace in the Middle East and we shall witness more unnecessary suffering and tribulation. We shall witness more innocent people being sacrificed and we may possibly be confronted by a situation fraught with incalculable consequences, not precluding a global conflagration. Hence, the troubled situation in the Middle East should not be considered as arising principally from a state of war between Arab States and the Zionists; for, indeed, this troubled situation essentially emanates from the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their own homeland.\n49.\tLet us face the facts, no matter how distressing and unfortunate those facts are. Let us not beguile ourselves by merely treating the symptoms, but let us get to the root of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts of violence which \\\"lie in misery, frustration, grievance and despair\\\" and which cause some people \\\"to sacrifice human lives, including their own, in an attempt to effect radical changes\\\" [see A/8791/Add.l]. Those are the very words of our Secretary-General, words which were endorsed by the General Assembly in including this item [item 92] in its agenda.\n50.\tFor many years now the United Nations has been dealing with several items of the utmost importance. These items have a direct bearing on the lives of millions of people around the world. In spite of the fact that the United Nations has been continuously preoccupied with such questions as disarmament, racial discrimination and the elimination of colonialism in all its forms, I submit that very -slow and limited progress has been made towards finding satisfactory solutions to most of these problems. Indeed, the world is still engaged in an unflagging armaments race and nations continue to increase their stockpiles of lethal weapons.\n51.\tOn the other hand, racial discrimination, particularly in certain parts of Africa and elsewhere, is not only rampant but unfortunately still shapes the policies of a number of Member States that more the preamble to the Charter, which decries such nefarious policies. Added to all this, some of the worst forms of colonialism are still extant in several regions of the world. It is saddening, therefore, to witness the impotence of the United Nations to uphold the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination, and to find those peoples ruled arbitrarily by an oppressive minority, as is happening in South Africa, Rhodesia, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).\n52.\tApart from all this, and in a different context, I must not forget to mention the tens of thousands of Pakistanis still languishing in Indian prisons.\n53.\tCertain international organizations have been established with the sole purpose of ensuring the greatest possible human welfare and prosperity. Two of those organizations are the OAU and the International Islamic Organization. The purposes and principles of those organizations are in total harmony with those of the United Nations. We cannot but take pride in the leaders who participated in founding those organizations; the more so since their noble goals on both the regional and the international level fall within the framework of the United Nations Charter.\n54.\tIn this connexion, I am happy to state that the International Islamic Organization, to which I referred in my statement during the last session [1961st meeting], consists of 32 Moslem countries. In spite of the short period since that Organization came into being, we consider its achievements to be of high historical importance and we take particular pride in the fact that it is owing to the consistent efforts of His Majesty King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz and his brethren the kings and Presidents of other Moslem States that the Organization is having such a salutary impact on the whole Moslem world.\n55.\tIn conclusion, let me assure you that the International Islamic Organization was founded with the purpose of bringing about peace, which is the essence of the sacred mission of Islam. That Organization is one of the largest in the world. Its principles are based on justice unto others and appropriate support for the right of peoples and nations to self-determination, while none the less endeavoring to raise the social and economic standard of living for Moslems and non-Moslems alike so as to include the whole of mankind.\n56.\tIt is on this basis, therefore, that we take pride in supporting the OAU in all that it is doing to establish universal peace and the type of development that will lead ultimately to world stability.\n57.\tFinally, we express the hope that the United Nations will eventually be able to live up to the expectations of all the peoples of the world and we also sincerely hope that conditions in the world will be such as to enable this Organization to play the historic role for which it was founded.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of my Government and myself, our sincerest congratulations on your election to the office of the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We recognize in you the representative of a European nation that is ardently working for peace and stability on our continent. We are confident that under your leadership the General Assembly will function effectively and harmoniously.\n202.\tWe see today a profound change in international relations, one unprecedented in modern history. This change is characterized by an increased search for dialog between the great Powers in order to solve international problems.\n203.\tIndeed encouraging is the determination of the great Powers to do their utmost to prevent conflicts or situations which would serve to increase international tensions from arising. If this process of detente will promote, as we hope and believe, general conditions in which all countries can live in peace and security without outside interference in their internal affairs, our hopes will have been well founded. We also hope that in this process the great Powers will find it possible to establish their relations on a permanent basis of mutual trust, in spite of ideological and structural differences.\n204.\tThe efforts of the major Powers have already led to meaningful results. The agreements on the limitation of strategic arms signed in Moscow by the Soviet Union and the United States on 26 May 1972 are not only a significant step towards enhancing international peace and security; they are also an expression of a growing feeling of trust and a genuine will to co-operate for a common cause. It is to be hoped that dialog rather than dispute will become the dominant feature in international politics.\n205.\tThe efforts by the major Powers to contribute to a lessening of tension should not be seen as an alternative to the functions of the United Nations as an instrument for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Rather, we would see them as an effort to overcome the lack of agreement which has so often manifested itself in the past between the major Powers and has prevented them from making full use of this Organization for the purpose for which it was originally created.\n206.\tThe effective use of the United Nations, as we have consistently emphasized, also depends on whether we can make it truly universal. An important step in that respect was taken last year, when the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China were finally restored in the Organization. We are confident that the progress under way in Europe will pave the way for the two German States to become Members of the United Nations in the near future. Similarly, the efforts by North and South Korea to normalize their relations should encourage this Organization to provide them with equal opportunity to take part in its work in the future.\n207.\tThe Secretary-General, who has with determination assumed the responsibilities of his office, has in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add-l] raised some fundamental and timely questions about the future role of the United Nations in the political process of establishing and maintaining international peace and security. Finland, as a neutral nation, has an especially vital interest in the development of a peaceful and rational world order based on a collective security system provided for by the Charter of the United Nations. Finland has consistently regarded this Organization as the only viable international instrument for strengthening international peace and security. It is therefore natural that the Finnish Government will remain fully committed to this Organization and will give its continued support to the Secretary-General in his efforts to strengthen it as an instrument for solving international disputes.\n208.\tThe positive change in the international situation has also clearly manifested itself on a regional basis. The European reconciliation was set in motion by the treaties concluded between the Federal Republic of Germany, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and Poland, on the other. This process has been further enhanced by the entry into force in June of the four-Power agreement on Berlin, as also through the on-going negotiations between the two German States.\n209.\tIn accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, and in a spirit of detente, Finland has been working actively for the cause of European reconciliation. We are genuinely encouraged by the positive response which our initiatives and efforts to realize a conference on European security and co-operation have met. The Finnish\nGovernment believes that recent international developments have contributed decisively to making the preparatory multilateral consultations in Helsinki a reality in the near future.\n210.\tThe conclusions the Finnish Government has drawn from the fundamental changes which we are presently witnessing in the European situation further encouraged us last fall to make an identical proposal to both German Governments for a comprehensive arrangement of relations between Finland and the two German States. Later, in July of this year, the Finnish Government concluded that the time had come to enter into negotiations with both those States. These measures are based on the policy Finland has consistently pursued with regard to the two Germanys. That policy is dictated by our desire as a neutral country to stay outside the dispute between the great Powers on the German question or the bilateral differences between the two Germanys deriving there from and consistently to offer equal treatment and to seek to maintain equal relations with both.\n211.\tOur contribution towards European reconciliation has been possible, we believe, because of our position as a neutral European nation. The recognition our policy has received from all sides has strengthened in us our conviction that neutrality cannot today be viewed as a passive concept but rather calls for active participation in efforts to keep peace and to promote co-operation between nations globally as well as regionally.\n212.\tThe strengthening of international security cannot be limited to efforts to contain or extinguish existing conflicts. Global disarmament and arms control are, indeed, most essential to our efforts to preserve coming generations from the scourge of war.\n213.\tThe Finnish Government therefore considers that this Assembly should give serious attention to realizing the proposals submitted last year by the Government of the Soviet Union  and subsequently endorsed by the Assembly at last year's session for the holding of a world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)]. We believe that such a conference, if well prepared under the auspices of the United Nations, will offer an additional impetus to work in this field. The world disarmament conference should, in our view, be regarded, not as an alternative avenue of approach, but as a corollary to the valuable work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. A necessary goal of the world conference would be to universalize the disarmament negotiations. The participation in such a world conference of all the permanent members of the Security Council, by the militarily significant nations and by the divided States, obviously remains indispensable for the attainment of any meaningful results.\n214.\tThe Finnish Government attaches equal importance to the early conclusion of a treaty banning the use, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. We are encouraged by the fact that progress is being made in Geneva in this regard, and we hope that an early solution can be found inter alia to the question of the verification and control of those weapons.\n2.15. In our opinion, the control of a treaty on chemical weapons should be based on a combination of national and international measures. The purpose of efforts to solve the main technical problems connected with such a treaty would be to promote an atmosphere of mutual trust and thus establish conditions for the emergence of a political consensus.\n216.\tThe generally favorable trends in international relations that I have touched upon have contributed to a feeling of confidence in the future. Unfortunately, the overall situation has a negative side, as well.\n217.\tThe wave of international terrorism is reaching alarming dimensions throughout the world today. If not turned back in time, it can do irreparable damage to the world community as a whole. It is at present affecting all of us, irrespective of geography, size or political influence. The Government of Finland consequently supports the initiative taken by the Secretary-General. It is imperative that urgent attention be given to this serious and complex problem.\n218.\tIn Vietnam, we have in recent months witnessed an escalation in war, destruction, and human suffering. Finland has consistently maintained that the conflict in Vietnam can be solved only through a political settlement guaranteeing the Vietnamese people the right to decide its own future without external interference. The negotiating contacts must, therefore, be fully utilized.\n219.\tSimilarly, in the case of the Middle East, it is distressing to note that the peace-keeping process has come to a complete standstill. We see today an increased danger that the trend of affairs may, in fact, reverse itself. We must, therefore, once again make a most serious appeal to the parties concerned to show restraint and make a renewed effort to find a solution based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n220.\tThe United Nations peacekeeping efforts, however inconclusive, remain an indispensable element in our endeavors to help solve international disputes through this Organization. Finland has consistently emphasized the importance of reaching early agreement on guidelines for future peace-keeping operations and their financing. We therefore urge the Committee dealing with these matters to make a fresh start and present us, in the near future, with a final agreement on the first stage of its task.\n221.\tThe efforts which the Secretary-General has undertaken with regard to Namibia at the request of the Security Council might for the first time in many years justify some feeling of hope. This, however, must not, in the opinion of the Finnish Government, become an alternative to our continued pressure on South Africa; nor must the limited results of the Rhodesian sanctions lead us to abandon them. We . must, on the contrary, abide by them in accordance with our Charter obligations and make every effort to strengthen them. The active participation of the permanent members of the Security Council is of decisive importance for a solution of all the crucial problems of southern Africa.\n222.\tIn the work of our Organization in the field of economic and social development there are encouraging signs, in spite of a regrettable slowdown in the growth of the flow of resources. We have noted with satisfaction an increasing recognition of the close interdependence between economic and social development. The recognition of this interdependence is reflected in the wish to strengthen the co-ordinating rote of the Economic and Social Council. Furthermore, the third session of UNCTAD did recognize the necessity of the widest possible participation of the developing countries in negotiations and decisions affecting their immediate interests, such as those linked to the international monetary system and the future multilateral trade negotiations. The problems of the least developed countries were also given special attention. These efforts need efficient over-all co-ordination. That, in our view, can best be undertaken by the Economic and Social Council.\n223.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has demonstrated that a third aspect, the human environment, has been incorporated into our concept of development. The Declaration on Human Environment  adopted unanimously at the Conference leaves no doubt that the environmental consequences of development cannot be dealt with in isolation. Overall economic and social planning can be considered only within the environmental possibilities in order to put the activity of man in relation to his environment and natural resources. The universal realization of this fact must lead us to an equally universal feeling of responsibility in the management of the development process.\n"

        "file_text": "A country proud of its past, of its customs and of its traditions, a nation working in the challenging task struggling against under-development, injustice and poverty, a people, finally, determined to affirm its identity, its personality and its sovereignty when confronting the future: such is the Malagasy Republic in October 1972.\n81.\tI, who have the honor today of speaking for the first time on behalf of that Republic, address to the President its sincere congratulations on his election to preside over this twenty-seventh session of our General Assembly. I am convinced that, thanks to his eminent qualities as a politician, diplomat and specialist in international affairs, the work of this session of the Assembly will take place in a calm atmosphere, will bear the hallmark of objectivity and will be crowned by the success that the peoples of the entire world with deep hope expect of it.\n82.\tI am very happy to stress the remarkable and able mastery with which the President's predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, presided over the work of the twenty-sixth session.\n83.\tI am very happy also to be able to pay a solemn tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his efforts, carried out with'' patience and courage, to confront with determination all the intricate problems that face the international community.\n84.\tThe Malagasy Republic wishes to do its small part and to make its modest contribution to the great common three-fold goal: peace, fraternity and international justice. It is for that reason that, despite our remoteness and insularity, we are determined to keep in touch with the world and to have our voice heard on all current problems.\n85.\tThus we, the people of the Malagasy Republic, welcome agreement and reconciliation here and the relaxation of tension and normalization there. We are extremely happy, first of all, at the entry into force of the treaties signed between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and between the latter and Poland. We are also gratified at the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and at the economic opening of the German Democratic Republic to the other European nations.\n86.\tWe are also gratified at the ratification of the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan in August 1972. Finally we are gratified at the opening of direct talks between the two parts of Korea, which, we hope, will lead very soon to the reunification of the country.\n87.\tIn particular we welcome the forthcoming conference on European security, and the signing on 3 October of the documents dealing with the entry into force of the agreements on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. \n88.\tWe note with satisfaction the recent movement of international relations towards the emergence of a multi-polar system capable, we believe, of encouraging greater interdependence in relations among States, non-alignment and, finally, negotiations and positive bilateral agreements.\n89.\tFinally, we wish to pay a warm tribute to the spirit of Rabat, which allowed the African countries to set aside what divides them and devote themselves fully to what unites them, and thus to concentrate their efforts on common action to ensure unity, liberty and peace. We earnestly hope that this same spirit of Rabat will make it possible rapidly to solve the present dispute between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n90.\tBut unfortunately we must recognize that these few bright patches are not sufficient to remove the clouds from the skies of international relations, where storms still break out here and there, while heavy cumulo-nimbus clouds still darken the horizon, particularly of the third, world the beleaguered third world, where aggression is committed here and there, while the clash of rival ideologies and ambitions still causes far-off conflicts that are as murderous as they are deplorable.\n91.\tThus, in Viet-Nam the blind bombing of civilian targets and populations continues relentlessly without justification. More than a quarter of a century of war has proved, if we needed proof, that a military solution to this conflict is most improbable and that it is up to the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese alone to find a negotiated, just, equitable and lastL solution, without foreign interference. That is the essential condition without which, we believe, the Vietnamese people cannot live in peace, and certainly not in peace with independence and dignity. Only the neutralization of South-East Asia can restore peace to that region.\n92.\tIn the Middle East, our position regarding the long-standing conflict which afflicts that area is, again, dictated by realism, justice and respect for equal rights. We believe that one would have to be very naive today to say that Israel could be purely and simply wiped from the map of the world. Israel is a reality. It is a regrettable fait accompli in the sense that it was practically imposed on the international community by the great Powers of the time. But, all the same, it is a fait accompli. On the other hand, what we categorically refuse to accept is that Israel should go from one fait accompli to another and conduct itself with impunity as an expansionist, imperialist and war-like Power. As a member of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] we refuse to agree that a foreign State can occupy by force the territory of another State and in particular of an African State, Egypt, trampling underfoot at one and the same time the inalienable right to existence and self-determination of the Palestinian people.\n93.\tThat is why we forcefully reiterate our unreserved support for Security Council resolution 242 (1967) calling upon Israel to withdraw from the territories that it improperly occupied after the famous six-day war. In the present state of affairs that is the only way that will lead to a peaceful, just and equitable settlement of the conflict. If that thorny question is not solved, if the roots of the evil are not attacked, it is obvious that all the efforts we might decide to make against certain desperate acts of terrorism, however deplorable they may be, will be in vain.\n94.\tAnother subject for mitigated satisfaction is the question of disarmament. While we note with satisfaction the Moscow Agreement of 26 May 1972 on the limitation of strategic offensive arms, it still is a fact that a limitation on the installation of anti-ballistic missiles and the establishment of a numerical ceiling for offensive missiles should have been accompanied by a concomitant limitation on the qualitative increase in the nuclear arsenals of the superPowers. In other words, we whole-heartedly insist upon the need to sign as soon as possible a convention on chemical and biological weapons and on the urgent need for general and complete disarmament. We also advocate the holding of a world conference on disarmament, the main objective of which would be the destruction of all nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass annihilation.\n95.\tRegarding the difficult problem of development, we believe the achievement of a harmonious and equitable development of world economy to be indispensable, as also the establishment of a new economic and social order that will meet the needs of all nations and all peoples.\n96.\tBut, alas, we still fall into a certain skepticism if we objectively analyze the world economic situation. The growth rate of the so-called developing nations falls far short of the target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade. The deterioration in terms of trade also causes disquiet to the countries of the third world. And, finally, the third session of UNCTAD unfortunately did not live up to the hopes that the 77-now the 96-developing countries placed in it after the Declaration of Lima. \n97.\tUnder-development is not just a delay in development; it is the unavoidable consequence of a one-sided approach to the organization of world trade which favors a minority at the expense of the great majority. The balance-or should I say the imbalance that has been established between the developed and the non-developed countries is deeply unjust and wrong. The poor constantly sell at lower prices and purchase at higher prices from the wealthy.\n98.\tThe self-centered economies of the industrialized countries have long seen their products appreciate in value, which allows them further to develop, to the detriment of the peripheral non-self-reliant economies of the needy countries. But that appreciation has gone so far that it must not be allowed to last indefinitely. Therefore, it is imperative that the under-developed nations form a common front in the international community confronting the wealthy countries, if only to ensure proper rates for their raw materials.\n99.\tThe logical corollary of the problem of development that is, the problem of decolonization and human rights cannot fail to be a subject of great concern to a proletarian nation such as Madagascar. Saint-Exupery told us, \\\"Respect for man, respect for man: that is the touchstone! \\\" But if respect for man lies in the hearts of men, then men will eventually ensure a social, political and economic system that enshrines that respect.\n100.\tThe tie between development and decolonization would seem to be obvious, since both rest on respect for and recognition of the rights of peoples. Colonialism, racism, the denial of human rights these are the main obstacles to the development of any man and of the whole man.\n101.\tRespect for man and the sovereignty of peoples, recognition of the interests and rights of the indigenous inhabitants, respect for democracy, the rights of self- determination, freedom and justice all are leitmotivs that should continue to receive priority today even though they are somewhat tarnished in the midst of the contradictions that gnaw at the very basis of our civilization. That those conditions are far from achieved in Africa is an obvious fact. That is why we of the Malagasy Republic reaffirm as loudly as ever the following points: first, that Namibia must be liberated from the illegal presence of South Africa, in accordance with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 21 June 1971 ;  secondly, that Southern Rhodesia should be cleared of the oppression of the white minority of Ian Smith; thirdly, that a new Constitution should be drawn up to replace that of 1969, which has been recognized by neither the United Nations nor the Administering Authority; and fourthly that the sham blockade of Rhodesia should cease immediately. That is one of the reasons why the Malagasy Republic put an end to a so-called \\\"blockade air force\\\" based in Majunga. An effective blockade must be set up or the present blockade, which is nothing but a joke, should be ended. Thirdly, the perpetuation of Portuguese domination in West and East Africa gravely threatens international peace and stability in the region.\n102.\tThe right to self-determination of these Non-Self- Governing Territories must be recognized and respected, and efforts to carry out indirect recolonization must be denounced and rejected in particular, the placing of more than 1 million expatriate settlers in Mozambique and Angola in order to build the Cabora Bassa and Cunene dams.\n103.\tWe cannot end these brief considerations on the decolonization of peoples without drawing the attention of this distinguished gathering to certain improper interpretations and also certain oversimplifications confusing gratuitous terrorism with the struggle for national liberation, particularly in Africa. While we condemn senseless and blind terrorism, we support and encourage the just struggle of the national liberation movements. In desperation, the colonized peoples have no alternative but to resort to violence in order to cut the Gordian knot that binds them.\n104.\tWhat, finally, are we to say about apartheid, that scourge of the twentieth century that still defies public opinion? All nations that love peace and justice must resolutely fight together to eliminate this crime against mankind from our planet for ever. We, for our part, honestly believe that we have fought effectively against apartheid by cutting off all dialog with South Africa. Paradoxically, that seems to suit both sides-both those who support and those who attack the dialog policy. We have served the supporters of dialog by showing the vanity of that policy as conceived, noting that the Pretoria regime has not changed its policy of apartheid one iota, and proving that no concession has been made in favor of the blacks of South Africa. That might have led Mr. Vorster to modify his position if he wanted to interest certain countries of Africa in dialog.\n105.\tBut we feel we have strengthened even further the camp of intransigent adversaries of racial segregation by proving that in the more-and-more threadbare guise of dialog the segregationists of Pretoria have only endeavored to divide the Africans and to find customers ready to condone their imperialist and racist policies. Therefore, by that historic and twofold decision, we are convinced that we have served the cause of justice, fraternity and freedom.\n106.\tObviously, some who still dream of the absurd and distant past have tried to discourage us by waving the specter of bankruptcy before us. Some have in fact tried to blackmail us by using measures of extortion such as sabotage or the abandonment of an economic project that might have greatly helped to promote the economic development of our country. We shall answer them resolutely and in this we shall be accompanied by the voice of the entire Malagasy people that regardless of what happens we shall not go to Canossa.\n107.\tWe would prefer to give up such a grandiose and profitable investment if it would mean increasing our dependence upon foreigners if the price must be the relinquishment of our sovereignty and national dignity.\n108.\tIn conclusion, I shall merely state that all the peoples of the world aspire to development, to better living conditions, to justice and to peace.\n109.\tBut to attain these noble aims the unity and the solidarity of all are more than ever necessary. Concerted and united efforts on the part of one and all are more than ever essential. All nations-whether large, medium or small must make a positive contribution to the maintenance of peace and to the settlement of the important interrelated problems of the moment: development, decolonization, human rights, disarmament and peaceful coexistence, among others.\n110.\tWe in Madagascar wish to state solemnly in this forum that, after more than 80 years of abdication and eclipse, Madagascar is now enjoying a renaissance and from now on intends fully to play its rightful role in our part of the Indian Ocean. We have put an end to 12 years of mistrust, diffidence and lack of understanding regarding certain socialist and progressive countries by establishing with all these countries, whether from the East or the West, relations of a dispassionate nature based on mutual respect, a clear understanding of our common interests and the five principles of peaceful coexistence.\n111.\tAnd we trust that we shall be able to progress with our sincere and forthright policies because this is the most pragmatic form of pragmatism and the most realistic form of realism.\n112.\tWe are, in one word, convinced that humanism, in the fullest sense accepted and desired by all, is the sole foundation for peace, justice and the democratization of international relations.\n113.\tWith this in mind, we are no less convinced that under your guidance, Mr. President, the work of this session of the Assembly will attain the objectives set for it.\n114.\tMay I conclude by assuring you, Mr. President, that in that task the collaboration and the understanding of the Malagasy Republic are entirely at your disposal. We wish to thank you for hearing us with patience.\u2003\n"

        "file_text": "I should like, on behalf of His Majesty the King, the Government and the people of Bhutan to extend to Mr. Stanisfew Trepczynski our warmest congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. In his capacity as Deputy Foreign Minister of his country he has already distinguished himself as a statesman of high caliber. We are confident that under his able guidance our discussions during succeeding months will be fruitful. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay my tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, who guided the deliberations of this Assembly during the last session with such great distinction. To the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, I should like to pay a special compliment for his wise and dedicated leadership of this world body at a moment when it is faced with so many complex and crucial problems.\n2.\tBhutan became a Member of the United Nations last year. For several centuries we had followed a policy of self-imposed isolation to preserve our country's sovereignty and independence. While the policy was successful in achieving that objective, it left our country socially, economically and politically backward. The man primarily responsible for ending that policy and leading our country into the mainstream of the modern world was His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, who passed away recently at the young age of 44 years, following a heart attack. There have been extremely few monarchs in the history of the world who like him have been so selfless, enlightened and progressive. During the 20 years of his reign he introduced sweeping social, economic and political reforms which have changed the face of our country. Under his wise and inspiring leadership we have made significant progress on the road to modernization. With the help of our friendly neighbor India we are building up the social and economic infrastructure of our country through a series of five-year plans, two of which have already been completed and a third was launched last year.\n3.\tOur new King, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, is determined to follow in the footsteps of his great father. In the sphere of foreign policy, His Majesty has reaffirmed our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter and to the policy of non-alignment and friendship with all countries. In the domestic sphere, His Majesty has pledged himself to work selflessly and with devotion to provide our people with a better, richer and fuller life.\n4.\tThe preceding year has been a momentous one. Although the world continues to face many serious problems, certain hopeful signs have begun to emerge. President Nixon's recent visits to China and the Soviet Union have for the first time after several decades unfolded opportunities which could usher in an era of real detente. My delegation welcomes this positive development and we hope that these new contacts which have been established between the leaders of the United States on the one hand and China and the Soviet Union on the other will contribute positively to bringing about real peace in the world. In the context of improved relations between the major Powers of the world, and in the context of the changes that are taking place in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe and other parts of the world, we can now look forward to the coming years with hope and optimism.\n5.\tFor the first time in over two decades, signs of peace on the Indian subcontinent have begun to emerge. The possibility of a thaw in Indo-Pakistani relations is no longer a remote possibility but a possible reality which is within the grasp of the leaders of India and Pakistan. This affords the people of the subcontinent a real chance to live in peace and amity. We have noted with satisfaction the outcome of the recent summit meeting between the leaders of India and Pakistan, which has resulted in some significant progress being made towards a lasting and, durable peace on the subcontinent. We are convinced that the leaders of both India and Pakistan desire genuine peace and it is the hope of my Government that the two countries will be able to work out satisfactory solutions to their problems without interference from outside.\n6.\tBhutan welcomes the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent sovereign nation. We extended our sympathy and support to the people of Bangladesh during their struggle for national liberation and we are happy today that we were one of the first to recognize the reality of Bangladesh a reality which has now been recognized by over 90 nations of the world. We wish the people of Bangladesh well and hope that they will be able to take their rightful place in this Assembly of nations without further delay.\n7.\tThe emergence of Bangladesh and the changes that are taking place on the Indian subcontinent have undoubtedly brought about new political equations in Asia. Bhutan is fully conscious of the far-reaching changes that are taking place in our part of the world and we are taking the necessary steps to adjust our attitudes and policies in the context of those changes. It is gratifying to note that our relations with our neighbor India continue to be most cordial and friendly. Our relations with India are based on equality and mutual trust and advantage, and we look forward to an era of still greater co-operation and friendship with India in the years to come.\n8.\tMy delegation considers the contacts which have recently been established between the leaders of South and North Korea as a positive factor leading to the restoration of peace and normalcy in that region, as a prelude to the eventual reunification of Korea. We welcome those positive developments and fully support the efforts of the people of both South and North Korea to establish durable peace in their country.\n9.\tMy delegation has read with great satisfaction the joint communique issued on 29 September 1972 by the Prime Ministers of Japan and China at the conclusion of Prime Minister Tanaka's visit to China. We welcome these high- level contacts and the decision which was taken to normalize relations between those two great Asian countries. Improved relations between Japan and China will undoubtedly be a positive factor in ensuring peace and stability in East Asia.\n10.\tWe have also noted with satisfaction the climate of detente in Europe and we welcome the agreements recently signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland. We also welcome the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 and the contacts established between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic with a view to improving relations between them.\n11.\tThese hopeful signs should not, however, blind us to the fact that the world is still not free from conflicts. In the Middle East little progress has been achieved towards a lasting peace. My delegation believes that Security Council resolution 242(1967) provides the requisite framework within which a peaceful solution' of the Middle East problem could be found, a solution which would take into account the just and legitimate aspirations of all concerned. We are convinced that this problem can be solved through peaceful means without resorting to force. It is the hope of my delegation that all concerned will work towards the peaceful solution of this tragic problem. In this connexion we have noted with satisfaction that Ambassador Jarring has resumed his mission to bring peace to the area. We wish him every success in his difficult task. It is equally the hope of my delegation that the conflict in Viet-Nam will come to an end soon and that the people of that war-torn land will be able to live once again in peace and harmony. The recent decision to resume the peace talks in Paris is a welcome development in this regard and my delegation expresses the hope that its outcome will be fruitful.\n12.\tDuring the past two years or so significant progress has been made in the field of disarmament. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union have resulted in a partial accord. My delegation welcomes the recently concluded treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States in that connexion.  My Government is totally committed to the concept of general and complete disarmament and would like this limited accord to be extended so as to encompass a wider area of general disarmament in all its aspects. It is in the same spirit that we welcome the agreement signed in Moscow during the visit of President Nixon relating to co-operation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. My delegation will continue to watch with interest the proceedings of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, whose achievements, though limited so far, have not been insignificant. We consider it imperative for all nuclear Powers to fully participate in the deliberations of the Committee on Disarmament so that this forum could become more representative and effective. My delegation supports the proposal to convene, with adequate preparation, a world disarmament conference, with the participation of all countries of the world.\n13.\tMy delegation shares the concern of our Secretary-General and other Governments at the alarming increase that has taken place in terrorist activities in recent months. We firmly believe that any form of intimidation or terrorist activity ought to be condemned. We view with serious concern the increase in such activities in recent years and would support any move which would, through collective action, bring an end to this senseless violence which causes suffering to so many innocent individuals.\n14.\tDuring the last General Assembly session my delegation supported the proposal to declare the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. My Government is convinced that as a first step it may be desirable to declare such areas or zones as could be mutually agreed upon as areas or zones of peace. We note with regret, however, that little progress has been made so far in implementing the provisions of the General Assembly resolution on this subject [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. Being a hinterland State belonging to the Indian Ocean area, Bhutan is deeply interested to ensure that the Indian Ocean and the adjoining areas should be free from becoming an area of confrontation between the super-Powers.\n15.\tAnother area which constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security is colonialism and racism. In spite of several years of sustained efforts by the various United Nations agencies, Territories such as Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Southern Rhodesia and Namibia continue to be under foreign colonial occupation. My delegation is disappointed that very little progress has been made in accelerating the process of liberation of those colonial Territories. While my Government has noted with satisfaction the results of the efforts made by the Secretary-General to establish contacts with the leaders of South Africa and Namibia with a view to bringing about the independence of that Territory, we are not very hopeful that the Government of South Africa will heed the voice of world public opinion. The recent decision of the Government of South Africa to agree to the appointment of the representative of the Secretary-General for Namibia, while a welcome development, should not blind us to the position South Africa has always taken on the question of Namibia. My delegation has also noted with regret that in spite of the pressure of world opinion the Government of South Africa continues to practice unabated its policies of apartheid and racial discrimination. My delegation also views with concern the fact that no progress has been made to end the illegal white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. We are of the view that the hands of the Secretary-General and of the United Nations must be strengthened so that the United Nations could act as an effective instrument for ending the evils of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination.\n16.\tMy Government, like the Governments of many other countries of the third world, was disappointed at the outcome of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. If one of the major causes of friction and tension in the world is to be eliminated, then we must make a determined effort to reduce the massive disparities which exist in the standards of living of the peoples of the developed and the developing countries. My delegation had hoped that the recently concluded session of UNCTAD would provide an answer to some of the principal causes underlying this ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor nations of the world. It is, therefore, with a sense of deep disappointment that my delegation noted the very limited results achieved at the session. When the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] there was hope that we might yet, through collective action, solve some of the problems of trade and development. The subsequent events have, however, belied those expectations. We hope that the United Nations will be able to provide the necessary impetus and the machinery to solve these problems, which are of crucial importance to the developing countries.\n17.\tAlthough my Government could not participate in the recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June 1972, we have followed its deliberations with great interest. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the adoption of the Declaration by the Conference is one of the important landmarks in the history of the United Nations. While we realize that the problems of pollution and the environment cannot be solved overnight, the recent Conference has created the necessary awareness amongst the peoples and the nations of the world of the gravity of these problems. This in itself is a significant achievement, and I have no doubt that the continuing machinery of the Conference will take the necessary follow-up action in the matter.\n18.\tDuring the last quarter of a century man has made remarkable strides in science and technology. Today we have the means to utilize this remarkable knowledge we have gained for the good of all mankind. Man is ready to explore the tremendous wealth of outer space and other planets and of the seas and oceans. The resources of the sea have a tremendous potential if harnessed properly. My Government, therefore, welcomed the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and the Subsoil Thereof, Beyond the limits of National Jurisdiction, adopted by the General Assembly two years ago [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. We continue to support all measures aimed at declaring outer space and the sea-bed and ocean floor as the common heritage of all mankind, to be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes. My Government regards the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction as of great importance and will closely watch the outcome of the proposed conference on the law of the sea scheduled to be convened in 1973.\n19.\tIn conclusion, I should once again like to pledge my Government's continued support of the ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter. We pledge to work towards our common ideals and aspirations in the pursuit of peace. We are convinced that the United Nations remains one of the best hopes for mankind's survival. We shall not fail to contribute our modest bit in the strengthening of the United Nations so that this great Organization may continue to further the cause of world peace, progress and security.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I be permitted to greet you as the representative of a friendly nation which served as a model of resistance to all those who, refusing to surrender, followed your lead in the struggle for liberation. We greet you as a leader of that martyred people which, through blood and fire, carried endurance to the very extremes of human limits, and which, by fire and sword, vested the collective and individual dynamism of its sons with the traits of nobility, ethical values and the historic title of what at the time was already called the terrorism of the maquisards, although it was in fact your heroic resistance to the forces of evil. We also greet you as a witness of the;; barbarity and racism that dipped into the Warsaw ghetto to find fodder for the gas ovens. And finally we greet you as the incarnation of the triumph of the spirit of good over evil, a spirit whose manifestations and variations through the course of history have taken the form of nazism, colonialism and Zionism. None is better qualified than you to guide the difficult debates of the twenty-seventh session of this General Assembly with authority and serenity.\n20.\tIn our tribute we wish to include our distinguished colleague, President Malik, your predecessor. In so doing we also wish to salute the noteworthy steps taken by Europe in its policy of detente and security, and to hail at the same time the glimmerings of political detente, pale though they still may be, that are beginning to be visible in IndoChina and that give us hope that we may soon see dawn, and finally daylight in those countries of the rising sun that for decades have been plunged in the darkness of intolerance and domination. The qualities of heart and mind of both Mr. Malik and UThant, together with the will for change that was felt by all Members of our Organization, have already allowed us to restore the People's Republic of China to its legitimate rights and its rightful place in our Organization.\n21.\tWith you, Mr. President, and with Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our new Secretary-General, with what you represent in terms of imagination, strength of character and creativity, and in the light of the demands for change expressed without exception by all our colleagues-with greater or lesser success, with greater or lesser clarity, occasionally with a certain touch of weariness and concern, more indicative of frustration than rebelliousness, more indicative of a will to change than of sterile skepticism with you presiding over us, we expect even greater and better things than were accomplished by your predecessors, whose record showed positive accomplishments that do honor to them and to all of us.\n22.\tHow can we assist you in your efforts? What can we do amid all these recurring storms, in the face of all the obstacles and difficulties that crop up along your way, and despite the super-Powers that are not always helpful, despite the small and middle-sized nations as well that often take a defiant stand, and despite all the budgetary hindrances that go on forever and that add to the daily cares of our Secretary-General?\n23.\tHow, I say, can we help? As far as Tunisia is concerned, the way we can provide genuine and effective assistance is by making our modest contribution first of all by informing you of our feelings, of how we can see our world and its evolution, and by making it our duty to tell you what we believe to be just and true, without circumlocutions, without any trickery and at the risk of harming the feelings of some colleagues whom we have no reason to refer to and whom with your indulgence we beg, in advance, to pardon our statements to the extent that they believe that our comments are directed to them.\n24.\tWe have not come here as people go to an election meeting, to outbid each other, nor are we here as spectators in a theater who attend to support their champion or the star of the day. No, we have come with a desire mark my words-to conspire, in the best sense of the word, in the sense of Charles Maurras when he said, \\\"We conspire in order to decide upon a state of mind\\\". This state of mind we translate basically in the form of suggestions, proposals, follow-up action, enthusiasm, moral blows, those which put an end to coups d'etat and acts of force and which smash the barriers between men to smithereens, which propose other procedures, as for example in the case of the excessive use of the veto, whose survival in its present form runs counter to the spirit of our times and to the need for equity, harmony and fluidity that we all aspire to see prevail in human relations everywhere. True, the survival of the veto met the needs of the post-war period, immediately after that terrible war in which victory was won by the great Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union-and we reiterate our thanks and appreciation to them for that-these countries were granted the veto-and regretfully so-in order to reach agreement between themselves. However, the world has changed since then; other realities have been created, and therefore new forces and new problems and new requirements too, among which the defense of peace and of the United Nations like common sense become the task most widely shared today,\n25.\tIt is somewhat difficult for a man of our times to admit, as the practice of the veto would seem to imply and we may well be mistaken on this point that there are major nations and minor nations. We understand full well that each country carries its own specific weight with the authority and the ramifications flowing therefrom. The weight of the Soviet Union or of the United States has nothing in common with that of another less powerful country. Their contribution to the safeguarding, or for that matter to threats to peace, their contribution to aid and co-operation like their contribution to the daily life of our Organization cannot be compared.\n26.\tWe do not propose expressly to do away with the right of the veto, but rather to consider the number of countries that should perhaps eventually exercise that right as well as how to moderate the exercise of the veto so that its use will more validly and effectively serve the common objectives of our Organization. We propose that in any consideration of this issue, or in any research that we may call for, heed will be taken of this trend towards democratization, to which most of my colleagues have referred here-and how many cogent, pertinent and deeply felt and pondered things often expressed in eloquent terms have been said from this rostrum, or will be said during the debate on this issue!\n27.\tIf today this current of change through democratization appears more and more widespread and increasingly imperative it is precisely because it encompasses realities and truths which have emerged slowly, gradually and sometimes almost unnoticed both in the shadow of the United Nations, as well as with the help of the United Nations. The realities, these truths that are entangled together today-and which appear complex-we believe fall into two main categories. The first category of comments would cover what we might call the already established and accepted order. The second category would contain what is in the process of being, developing, seeking the trend towards a new order.\n28.\tIn what is established, in what already exists, we have a stage dominated by two great actors with a reservoir of economic force and power, and technological, political and military strength that has never been equaled in the history of mankind. Because of their decisive contribution to the victory over the Axis Powers, because of the many and specific circumstances that had divided them, ideologically, politically, economically and strategically but, fortunately never militarily, and also because of the remarkable competition they have waged in space exploration research and science and, finally, because of the balance of atomic terror that they have had the wisdom to respect, so that today we know a balance of caution, those two Titans have monopolized the international diplomatic chess game which was only natural-by taking a wise initiative here, getting involved in a misguided move there and often this would lead here, there or elsewhere to trends that finally turned into acts of hegemony or faits accomplis. Thus the super-power of one or another of the Titans is very often projected thousands of kilometers beyond the borders of its own territory. The will to control, through economic or technological means, through military bases and by means of the fleets that plough the seas and oceans and we have some first-hand knowledge of this in the Mediterranean by sophisticated weapons and even by war itself: all these attest to an excessive tendency to hegemony. All these acts, whether innocent on the surface or overtly aggressive, have been characteristic of the international situation, and still are today. So much for what already exists and is obvious, that which we might call the order of hegemony.\n29.\tRegarding the second type of comment, you have man's desire to be free, strengthened by the wave of decolonization movements which in a torrent of fresh, new ideas bubbles with enthusiasm and new values and seeks its equilibrium in a new order.\n30.\tWe wonder if, with time and with the will of men to free themselves, which like the sea is ever-renewed, the order that was created in the aftermath of the Second World War is not being affected today by the evolution in these orders, some of which we read about in history, such as Athens, Carthage and Rome in particular and which crumbled as a wall weakened by time and adversity crumbles. Colonial Europe had already had its experience, which could have been much more painful were it not for the healthy reactions of some enlightened minds such as Mendes-France and General de Gaulle to whom we are pleased to pay a tribute, men who having learned the lessons of history, were able to find in their culture, in their past and in their patriotism the necessary strength to avoid their country's suffering a decline in its influence and to transform a sense of exhaustion into a new, galvanizing breath of life which became a fountain of co-operation and mutual assistance.\n31.\tI would restate from this rostrum the question solemnly posed by President Habib Bourguiba at the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, which met at Rabat in June, when he spoke of whatever still survives as the shameful remnants of colonialism and when he also addressed himself to all those in Europe who want to put an end to colonialism. He said:\n\\\"Is it possible to consider that the European Community, inspired by the example of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Great Britain, which have all decolonized more or less successfully, will find the ways and means that will permit Portugal\\\" a country which is bogged down in a sorry business and which, since it is a Mediterranean country should be able to rely on our means of assisting it to decolonize \\\"to repatriate its last soldier, its last settler, while reserving to itself a place and a status still to be defined in the European Community? \\\"\nWe believe that is the only peaceful way to put an end to the bloodshed. It seems to us that this is the road we must follow in seeking what has been termed a dialog; furthermore, this would perhaps be the only form of useful dialog which could generate further dialogs that may mark the beginning of a new era, an era of reconciliation among Europeans, an era of friendship between Europeans and Africans, and lastly an era of solidarity among all men in a single order which must be worked out and put into force. Europe, having regained its rightful form, should deal with this problem\u2014Europe which symbolizes man and his dignity and freedom, man being in our opinion the means and source and end of all action, man, the brother of all men that Europe we hail more as a force for research and investigation, as a potential element of decolonization, as a new force working for a new equilibrium, rather than a Europe committed like the super-Powers trying to set up a new hegemony.\n32.\tJust as we welcome the demands for peace, progress and peaceful change which are emerging in Asia, Africa and Latin America, so do we consider encouraging the impressive efforts to enter and participate actively in international life made by great industrialized countries, Tanaka's Japan, Trudeau's Canada, and Australia, so bubbling with energy and industry at home, and heretofore acting in such a discreet manner beyond its frontiers. All these countries have lent an attentive ear to the third world and their minimum requirements for a decent life.\n33.\tHow can we also overlook the impressive and important role assumed by the People's Republic of China, fascinating and mysterious China, only yesterday outside the Organization and today impressive in its dialectics, force and new virtues. In the trends developing towards a new balance, the history, geography, the dimensions and genius of the Chinese people, the wisdom and seriousness of its leaders, their obvious readiness to abide by the rules of the game in their international relations, no one can doubt and all this evidence leads us to believe that the People's Republic of China, with its tremendous active assistance, hopes to inject a breath of fresh air, signal a fresh approach and make a substantial contribution towards the development of a new public spirit, dedicated to the cause of peace and progress, in other words, to the strengthening of our Organization.\n34.\tThus we believe that the hegemonic order of the post-war period cannot be maintained as rigidly as it has been, with this tendency to monopolize the fund of knowledge, will and power, while aspirations to diversify, to introduce fluidity, complementary relationships, harmony and a new balance are becoming more evident day by day.\n35.\tEverywhere we hear voices which must be heeded as a fact of life, expressing refusals and challenges, refusals to condone domination, occupation and aggression, challenges to control and manipulation from afar. On all sides and even within the hegemonic order we hear the same demands being voiced: we want to be free, really free, politically and economically, free to enjoy our culture, free to enjoy our ethos. We would like to recreate man, cure him. We want to bring man to man.\n36.\tTrue, this is still only a plea, a cry, but it is a significant plea and a somewhat prophetic cry. History has heard cries which have finally set men and events on a new course, and each time a new and better order has finally seen the light of day and each time mankind has taken a giant step forward, towards more justice, freedom and progress. The process is a familiar one. Appeals in various forms come from the humblest of our people, which set forth pressing needs, confirm trends and help to revitalize the fabric of international relations by bringing men closer together, reducing antagonisms and strengthening the obligation to achieve detente and solidarity.\n37.\tIt is significant to note that the war which has been ravaging the peoples of IndoChina, particularly the Vietnamese, even in all its most terrible and ghastly aspects which are repugnant to all who love justice and freedom, has made a significant contribution to a degree of detente between Washington and Peking and to a greater understanding between Moscow and Washington. It is unfair that the valiant people of Viet-Nam-which was one of the first to take up arms to win its freedom, which has contributed so significantly to the decolonization movement, and which continues to contribute despite, or perhaps because of, its present suffering, indirectly to encourage a detente between Washington, Peking and Moscow-it is unfair, I say, that his people should be the last to taste the fruits of peace when it was the first to act to achieve peace by dint of its struggle for its own independence, for the dignity of the peoples of the third world and, to a certain extent, for international detente.\n38.\tWe are saddened by the fact that the great American nation, our friend of all time, should be waging a most atrocious war against the valiant people of Viet-Nam, to which we are linked by so many ties and with whose Government we have already decided to establish diplomatic relations, although our ideologies and political systems differ.\n39.\tIs it not encouraging to note that, because of our demands to both sides for development, because of our quarrels, our tensions and our wars, and thanks to our desire for non-alignment and co-operation, we who belong to the group of smaller and medium-sized nations do in fact constitute in the eyes of the great Powers just so many forces of opposition which must be reckoned with, just so many channels of communication which cannot easily be ignored, just so much new blood that feeds the tissues of international life, just so many currents of feeling and also just so many sources of pressure applied to the superPowers and calling upon them to strengthen their understandings with one another, to encourage the dialog between their own proteges, their clients and friends, and, finally, to resign themselves to a more balanced and equitable reorganization of the world.\n40.\tLet us pay a tribute to our Secretary-General for his comment of great historic significance, in the introduction to his report:\n\\\"The interests, the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot, at this point in history, be ignored in any durable system of world order.\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 2.]\nDoes that not refer to the type of order being sought in this trend towards democratization, and the drive for freedom?\n41.\tWe hope, and in fact we believe, that the hegemonic order set up at the end of the Second World War is in the throes of transformation, that it is being transmuted into an immense wave of solidarity and universal co-operation just as colonial Europe has evolved and worked towards the type of entity it is today: an assembly of desires and strength which is being built up to ensure security and co-operation among the Europeans themselves and to promote solidarity and mutual assistance with others.\n42.\tIt is in this direction, it is for this new reign of man, for this new community more concerned with the quality of man's life than his level of living, a more generous or in other words a more just and fraternal community, that this Organization can do a great deal.\n43.\tWe know that this new community, this new balance, will not be achieved through any wave of a magic wand. Instead it will be the result of the long and difficult meditation, organization and efforts undertaken by the specialized agencies, intergovernmental as well as non-governmental organizations, regional organizations and the various manifestations of the attitude of the non-aligned countries, a group of countries to whom we should like to pay a tribute for their unremitting efforts and the sound work they have done.\n44.\tThe old cliches are becoming increasingly threadbare and shopworn. The old concepts of East and West, capitalism or communism, class struggle, management, collectivism, liberalism, republic, monarchy, all are concepts that have generated misunderstandings and squabbles with regard to which we must be reconciled as a matter of urgency so that we can devote ourselves to the sole task of solidarity and mutual assistance with a clear understanding of the options, it being clearly understood that any economic systems that are going to be adopted are deemed to be tools in man's service, the only objective that counts.\n45.\tFollowing U Thant, our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has forcefully raised the key questions confronting mankind which the United Nations can and should be resolved in the next few years by setting aside our quarrels and giving the impetus necessary to a fairer and more balanced type of growth.\n46.\tIf we, rich and poor, are aware that our world may become physically uninhabitable, that man's life is in mortal danger, that our planet seems too small to cope with the growth of population and its needs, why is this pressing feeling of solidarity not given top priority, so that it can be channeled and organized in the form of plans and instruments for effective, planned programs of work?\n47.\tThe problems of the environment haunt the highly industrialized nations; the question of population growth is the particular obsession of the poor nations; and the problems raised by certain aspects of technological and scientific development, such as communication by satellites, are of concern to those who cannot have them and who therefore must be satisfied with the information, guidance, and slogans which the possessors of communications satellites may wish to broadcast to them. All of these problems are really of concern to each and every one of us as a community.\n48.\tIs it not high time therefore for us resolutely to tackle these problems in the spirit of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment, held at Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972, and in accordance with the recommendations of the World Bank and the various specialized agencies that deal with development as well as-and this should be our primary aim-by redoubling consultations and agreements, by questioning one another and by .exchanging the results-of our experiences first at the regional organizational level and then at the level of our own United Nations.\n49.\tUnfortunately, in our community dangerous contradictions persist and tensions are constantly being renewed. I am thinking of the Israeli-Arab confrontation on Palestine, the racial confrontation between blacks and whites in Africa, the confrontation between Greeks and Turks over Cyprus and the confrontation between brothers in the Indian subcontinent. I am thinking of all these aberrant pressures which threaten to jeopardize all our efforts and searching to achieve a more balanced world.\n50.\tI am frankly and sincerely wondering whether, outside the maneuvers of the great Powers, sheltered from their games of what was yesterday the cold war and is today the hot detente, if left to ourselves, to our common will for freedom, justice and progress, we might not be able to overcome our differences through dialog and communication, seeing what each one discovers or develops and seeking to bring together those things which fit together, to bar what divides us and to compose the living synthesis that will help to solve our problems and to sustain our public spirit, in other words, our necessary solidarity.\n51.\tWith your leave, Mr. President, in this spirit I should like to address myself to Mr. Abba Eban and I am sorry that he is not in the seat where he ought perhaps to have been who spoke here on the situation in the Middle East. I should like to mention the situation in the Middle East, which, if it grows worse, may destroy the people and the countries of one of the most sensitive regions on this planet,\n52.\tFor half a century Zionists and Arabs of Palestine and elsewhere have been in a state of war tension, one side defending its latest conquests, the other awaiting its imminent revenge, alternating between arrogance and hatred-the Palestinians, the Arabs, repelled but not vanquished, and the Israelis, carried on the waves of their weapons and their myth but not victorious, continue in the face of the uncertainty of the future, to brood on violence and to generate despair, create an impasse and, as a consequence, brew terrorism and its blind effects. In the past it was the Israeli organizations of the Irgun and the Stern gang; today it is the Palestinian organizations like the Black September group.\n53.\tWhile words evolve as do men and reality, it is significant that when dealing with the problems of the Middle East we are open to suspicion if we do not use certain language. We are constrained to use certain words as we use a particular currency, a currency battered by years of war, a currency that serves only to deal in hatred, a counterfeit currency that nevertheless continues in use and distorts discussion, deceiving men and falsifying events.\n54.\tLet us not forget that in this region, where the heavens joined the earth to fertilize it with grace, rivalries have long existed and still exist, misinterpreting the spirit, committing crimes against men and sacrilege against God. In each undertaking and at each stage of a proposed solution, the density, intensity and complexity of the problem become apparent. Thus, the methods used and the very approach to the problems involved run amok when they touch that sensitive region of the world; they may seem in disarray, always impassioned, often skin deep, and sometimes they are more metaphysical and mythical than real.\n55.\tIt is also true that the Arab nations give an impression of chaos, with extreme affluence in some countries and extreme poverty in others accompanied by the annoying tendency of turning to the great Powers to seek openings or protection to support their quarrels, or perhaps to protect themselves against fate. It is equally true that the great Powers believe they can assure their domination by having proteges or clients, and today we see evidence of this in that the great Powers take each other's measure and gage themselves through \\\"small country\\\" intermediaries, while at the same time they get rid of their surplus outmoded weapons or try out new so-called conventional weapons on them.\n56.\tWhile it is true that in the past, the Arab countries racked up mistakes and stalemates it is equally true that their camp today is the camp of reason, loyalty and the will to self-determination as a result of the operations of the rules of the international game.\n57.\tLet people have the honesty to note and say that it is Israel's lack of reasonableness which blocks the decisions of the United Nations and develops a sort of dialectics of despair that pushes some persons to commit the reprehensible folly of hijacking civil aircraft and others to mortgage the development of their countries by devoting the largest portion of their moneys and their abilities to weapons, and still others to change regimes by a coup d'etat, for lack of the power to change the course of events and the present system which oppresses them now and blocks their prospects for the future.\n58.\tThe Arab nations of the. Middle East and the Palestinians have never felt as oppressed, as misunderstood and as hedged in as they do today. The Jews of the Warsaw ghetto could have, would have, understood this, The world could have, should have, understood this. For the people of Palestine, while the worst is never certain, the better life seems always to recede farther and farther from their grasp.\n59.\tYet in Israel's position there is such a margin of unreasonableness, so much excessive arrogance and defiance, such a will to flout the United Nations, its Secretary-General, its Security Council, its General Assembly, its various organs, the four great Powers and each Member State that all of this is more than enough to remove mountainous barriers of indifference and \\\"hands-off\\\".\n60.\tThat the great Powers, who are otherwise so touchy about matters of pride and prestige, have allowed the authority of the United Nations and public spirit to be degraded to such an extent is really food for thought; this is shocking, and where Israel is involved, this is what is the last thing to be expected. When Israel is involved or when it is a question of South Africa and Rhodesia, some great Powers forsake the United Nations and its moral authority floats away and depreciates like any common currency. But the fact that the Israelis behave as they do to the United Nations, which brought Israel into being in 1947 by arbitrarily imposing it on the Palestinians in a land that was, it is true, under British mandate but which had its own nationals, the Palestinians- Moslems, Christians and Jews - and the fact that the Israelis, the favorite children of 1947, today consider the United Nations as the graveyard of aborted resolutions and this was said quite clearly while the Arabs, yesterday's victims, agree to abide by the recommendations and the resolutions of the United Nations, these facts speak volumes about the evolution of the thoughts and habits of both sides. In the case of the Israelis, I cannot help thinking of that group of nursing infants, of whom Montaigne spoke, crammed full, spoiled and plump, who spit in their mothers' face and spit out their bile in the faces of those who watched them being born, in the faces of those who assisted at their birth.\n61.\tAllow me to say to Mr. Eban, whose ability is equal to his oratory: you know, Mr. Eban, that we in Tunisia feel no hatred towards you. You know how the Jews live in Tunisia. You know that in our Parliament there is even a Jewish Tunisian parliamentarian of whom we are proud. If we tell you this it is because we are sincere in our thinking and because we feel very deeply what we see. Neither we nor the Palestinians whom you despoiled of their country and their homes and whose national cause you relegate to the status of the eternal refugee problem, to a minor squabble, nor the Arabs whose land you seized, nor the Christians, nor the Moslems towards whom you became guilty of violence when you continued to attack Jerusalem have any resentment of you as a Jew or as an Israeli. Thanks to the conduct of President Bourguiba we make a constant effort to do away with hatred which stifles all growth, to avoid bypaths which lead us astray, and to set aside false warlike attitudes which only inflame the mind.\n62.\t\\\"What about Munich? \\\" you will say. Let us speak then of Munich. Let us speak of the facts and the true sequence of events. Munich, transformed for a time into the Olympic capital of the world after having been one of the citadels of nazism Munich where the champions took each other's measure and competed free from political and military passions, a few Palestinians felt they had to go to Olympic Village from which, as you know, they were excluded as they are excluded from all international affairs, and where, among others, the flag of Israel flew in the place and in the stead of the one that in their view should have been there: the Palestinian flag. They succeeded in taking certain distinguished Israeli champions as hostages in order to exchange them for some common fedayeen. To be sure, the practice of taking hostages is detestable at all times and even more detestable when the athletic stadium is chosen as the field of operations. But and I apologize for speaking parenthetically-I would merely observe in passing that I am not sure that this practice of taking hostages is not followed very often today in Gaza, in Jericho, in Jerusalem and in the holy places of the Moslems, Jews and Christians, but we won't talk about that today. So far nothing tragic had happened in Munich. Certain cold minds, trained, perhaps, in the computer schools and inspired by the gods of sport, probably even talked about a sporting performance. The Palestinians even said that they might take the Israeli champions to Tunisia, They even telephoned a Jordanian personality living in Tunisia, probably to stress, and rightly so, that, despite the black September repression of the Palestinians by the Jordanian authorities, the brotherhood between Palestinians and Jordanians still existed. But it was not up to the Tunisians, nor the Jordanian personage, nor the Palestinians, nor, I believe, their Israeli hostages, to organize the reception in Tunis for this extraordinary cargo of the strange visitors. Had they come to us, they would of course have been well received, and we would have undertaken a dialog with you calmly, convinced, as we always are, that it is better to talk, to exchange views, than to bomb and kill. The opening of a direct dialog between us on this subject would even have been more fruitful. It might have become a starting point; it might even have allowed the two irreconcilable antagonists, the Palestinian fedayeen and those who are called the Israeli hawks, to start a debate, to open up prospects for the future, and even to envisage certain solutions. In short, we would have talked, and no one knows exactly what might have happened.\n63.\tMr. Eban, it is most regrettable to have to tell you, who have always called sincerely for a dialog, according to information and indications we have, that it was you not you, personally, or course, but you, the Israeli leaders who insisted upon killing, instead of speaking to, the fedayeen.\n64.\tDoes this mean that you would speak to other Arabs, but that you plan to kill Palestinians directly or through a particular other European country or by Arab countries, who themselves are intermediaries, whom you often call upon to contribute to your security by asking them to liquidate Palestinians with the threat of terrorizing them, as you have recently done in Syria and in Lebanon.\n65.\tMr. Eban, mark these words:\n\\\"A few months ago, I said what I thought about Palestinian terrorism. I spoke out freely. Inevitably, you provoke terrorism when you reduce fanatical believers in a just cause to a hopeless situation.\n\\\"But the people I am talking about are not terrorists. They are simply martyrs. They will die with their weapons in their hands as heroes, as did the martyrs of the Warsaw ghetto. Like the Christian martyrs in the Coliseum, they have no weapon but their faith, but their decision to stand without flinching and accept the supreme sacrifice. In making this act of faith, this willingness, this act of will to sacrifice themselves, they are not humbled; they grow in stature. True, the Palestinian problem still stands in all its complexity. Rebellion cannot solve it. Terrorism will not solve it. Obstinate repression cannot solve it either. This problem, like so many others, is now in the lap of the United Nations.\n\\\"This delay has already cost too much suffering and created too much hatred. In Palestine, as in the rest of the world, we must have peace, and there is no lasting peace unless it is a just peace,\n\\\"Why does that Government stubbornly maintain its position? I know it is not its responsibility alone, and that more or less consciously or unconsciously, almost all the Governments of the world and the United Nations itself have at one time or another been its active or passive accomplices in this ghastly drama of Palestine. Why fall into recrimination? We must put an end to this. The universal appeal for justice is irresistible. We must ask mercy on these unhappy persons who, after so many tribulations and sufferings, legitimately and naturally seek the refuge of a homeland, their homeland. It is natural that in emerging from so many trials they dream of an asylum in a land which would be theirs, where they would find themselves among their equals with other free men and where they might at last be able to count on breathing, working and seeing their children grow up in a secure and brotherly atmosphere.\n\\\"That is my position. I never touch on this question without some qualms. I ardently hope that circumstances will allow this to be the last time I have to deal with this matter.\\\"\n66.\tMr. Abba Eban, all those noble words are not mine. They are not the words of an Arab, some impassioned speaker or some stranger. They are the words of a great man, a great mind-dead now. You know that. You know all this, but perhaps you do not know whose words they are. I have said they were the words of a great man\u2014Leon Blum. I have quoted them at length because they very clearly express the views of the Palestinians of today, having in their day expressed the feelings of the Jews of the Exodus in 1947. These words were written in 1947.\n67.\tSo, Mr. Eban, you see the danger that hangs over you, that threatens us all, is perhaps your tendency not to see facts as they are and not to link them with the future, and above all to keep from thinking about the future as clearly as Leon Blum did and as he asked others to do. Or perhaps you think of it too narrowly. You are keeping yourself down, torturing yourself by not wanting to change, by forbidding yourself to move, by setting yourself up, by stiffening your posture in formalism and the mold of procedure. By holding occupied territories as a direct surety, by creating a fait accompli elsewhere, by encouraging flight in other areas, by organizing the repression of Palestinians everywhere, you obtain for yourself, for us all and for the region a guarantee of unhappiness in the future.\n68.\tHave you not thought that hatred is now reaping its twenty-fifth harvest? That in the course of three wars were fought and won, all the Palestinian families were dismembered, dispersed, separated and strained and many other Arab families as well. And how many seeds of revolt have been sown in the region? What scale of values do you speak of? To what precedents do you refer? Tell us if you are ready to leave Jerusalem. Are you ready to accept a Palestinian homeland, a Palestinian State. Tell us what form of coexistence with the Palestinians you choose, and precisely what frontiers you would like. Are you for these objective arrangements for peace?\n69.\tMr. Eban, we believe you are sincere in what you say, and it is that that concerns us so much, because we must then wonder if in the final analysis it is in your regime's nature to be able to make peace. Above all do not say that the Arabs, the Palestinians themselves, avoid dialog aimed at peace. Propose valid conditions for peace and you will be astonished by the sense of responsibility and the constructive spirit of the most intransigent of the Arab leaders, including the Palestinians.\n70.\tIn a state of war there can be talk only of war.\n71.\tI apologize for having spoken heatedly and at such length. However, when we see the international situation evolving and among the shadows, there are pale glimmerings of light. The United States is engaged in useful dialogs with Peking and Moscow and even with Hanoi in order to reduce tension in the world. When we consider that the thorny question of Berlin is solved; when we see Germany and its neighbors embarking on a process of co-operation; when, finally, we see European countries working together to try to achieve a fresh climate of confidence and security among themselves; when the international community becomes more and more insistent in its demand for peace, it is a shame to note that there still exist vestiges of colonial era, racism or even Zionism, casting their shadows over the map of Africa or parts of the Middle East.\n72.\tSooner or later the frontiers of disapproval and isolation will close round these islands of hatred and racism. May this wish become a message, the one which resounds in Jerusalem, that of the one God, the God of the Jews, the Christians and the Moslems, calling men, all men, to brotherhood and concord. We will be worthy of Jerusalem, God, man, the United Nations and ourselves if we work to make this message a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I bring to you, and through you to this Assembly of nations, greetings from His Majesty King Sobhuza II, the Government and the people of Swaziland. These greetings come wrapped in the hope and confidence that this, the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, will become a tribute and a service to all mankind. You bring to this august body long and distinguished experience in international affairs, which surely reflects the history of your country, Poland. Throughout the historic session last year, your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, presided over this Assembly with originality, skill and charm. My delegation is confident, and happy, that the deliberations of this session of the Assembly under your able guidance will be meaningful and successful.\n2.\tAs you take up the reins of this supreme international body, new areas of tension in the world are emerging. Older and sadly familiar areas reveal no change for the better and some are flaring up again; but a few, just a very few areas, troubled of old, are showing signs of real reconciliation and understanding. The very geographical limits which once contained the strife and tension have become diffused so that the effects of disharmony can now be felt instantly, tragically, irrationally and by innocents half a world away from its source. Global involvement is manifest, and the global representation at this Assembly should see this development in its true and fullest sense.\ni\n3.\tThis body, this Assembly, epitomizes an international society which reveals, every living minute, the inherent reciprocity and interdependence among nations. Local problems do not necessarily remain localized and we, as a community of nations, would be unrealistic to regard them in isolation. In this regard, then, my delegation views with the utmost concern and alarm the continuing, and indeed the increasing, gravity of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The continuing failure to reach a lasting solution in this matter clearly requires the urgent attention of all right-thinking men and a strengthening, or perhaps a readjustment, of the apparatus set up by this Assembly to help resolve the situation.\n4.\tIt is most unfortunate that the endeavors of Ambassador Jarring in seeking means of finding a positive solution to the Middle East problem, in securing peace and in seeking to enshrine true national sovereignty for all nations in the Middle East have been hindered. The killing of innocent people cannot be justified by any man of good conscience. It is our hope that a solution will be found to end this human tragedy.\n5.\tSwaziland would like to see all the oppressed peoples freed in the shortest possible time as we feel that all people have a God-given right to self-determination. A denial of this inalienable right is not only wrong but inhuman.\n6.\tWe believe in majority and in non-racial democracy. Swaziland believes in non-violent and peaceful means for effecting political change. We hope that our neighbors in South Africa, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau) and Angola Will follow our example.\n7.\tSwaziland cannot, as we have indicated in the past, support violence in any part of the world. We continue to recommend the application of peaceful methods of nonviolent change. But if non-violence is to succeed, nonviolent agencies of change or political activity must be allowed. For that reason we regret that the political expression generated by the Pearce Commission in Southern Rhodesia has been suppressed. The Smith regime has once again demonstrated its bad faith towards the African majority, and has sown more seeds of bitterness and distrust, which will some day yield a harvest of violence and sadness for the people of that country. In Namibia we are looking forward to the successful conclusion of negotiations designed to transfer power to the people.\n8.\tAfter the experience of two world wars, wars which wiped out millions of people, nations and governments; after centuries of parochialism and regionalism; after the gradual growth of international awareness, Swaziland joined the United Nations and subscribed to the high ideals of its Charter. In this regard, the peaceful settlement of disputes without resort to force is paramount. We cannot, therefore, associate ourselves with any form of violence anywhere as a means of settling disputes.\n9.\tSo the war in South-east Asia, involving, as it does, forces from outside the area, is wrong and must be brought to a peaceful conclusion as soon as possible. In the view of my delegation, the people of South-east Asia themselves can best judge and create the best apparatus for their own livelihood and destiny.\n10.\tWe condemn violence in Northern Ireland among the Christians of that troubled British province; we condemn it in Africa, where some groups have used it as a major tool in a short-cut to power. We condemn it particularly in its global manifestation as air piracy or hijacking, wide-spread and often indiscriminate terrorism and political kidnapping. These ugly happenings, which frequently kill and maim innocent people, harass administrations and endanger vital public services, are especially evil and uncivilized. They divert national resources, all of which could have been channeled into means of improving the quality of life for some of the world's less fortunate people.\n11.\tIn two important and influential areas of the world, the fabric of national unity, where formerly there was none, can be seen as a bright star of hope for the future of those countries as well as for others still torn by conflict. I refer, of course, to East and West Germany and North and South Korea. This fabric of unity has not been woven easily and its pattern is still being developed. This Assembly, in the view of my delegation, should applaud these processes and in no circumstances take any action which might prejudice their fuller development.\n12.\tThe Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan represents a major step towards the normalization and harmonization of relationships on the Indian subcontinent. However, as one of the first countries to have recognized Bangladesh, Swaziland would urge upon this Assembly that the 75 million people of that country should have the right to membership in this family of nations.\n13.\tThe sorrow, misery and utter waste of human and material resources in two world wars and many subsequent confrontations have never been banished from our minds. The energies thus directed can be reconstituted and redirected in elevating the quality of man's life everywhere. There is now the technological skill available to translate all this effort into a race for peace and progress. Those areas of the earth and space which have not yet felt the impact of weapons should command all our attention so that no time is lost in their peaceful development for the good of all men. I refer particularly to the sea-bed, the ocean floor, the moon and space. Surely it is within our capacity to create the necessary legal and administrative structures, permeated with the fruits of meaningful human fellowship, to achieve this aim.\n14.\tIn this regard, Swaziland's sponsorship last year of the draft that became resolution 2832 (XXVI) declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace bears further examination. The area of this Ocean, up until recently not regarded as a sensitive military zone, is becoming a target for the less peaceful attention of some Powers. The nations that rightly regard the Indian Ocean as being on their own door-step have no nuclear designs or any other hostile ambitions in the area. They are in the forefront in seeing that other Powers regard the Ocean in a like manner. Unless the seas and oceans of the world come to be regarded as areas of peaceful and economic development only, unpeaceful usage will become more and more difficult to stop.\n15.\tPeace, security and prosperity are indivisible. The world economy cannot prosper in insecurity. My delegation believes that true independence derives from economic strength, from a carefully planned utilization of all national resources, material and human. Recently we have seen a detente in East-West relations which has opened up great possibilities for trade and for developmental financing among these countries. My delegation, however, notes with great concern the absence of a provision for developing countries in these arrangements and wonders how the objectives of reducing economic and technological gaps between developed nations and the third world will ever be realized. With this, coupled to the forbidding portents of the European Economic Community, if seems to my delegation the third world ought to be responsible for the control and development of its economies and seek a more rapid integration into the mainstream of the world economy by pressing for a fair share of international trade, by intensifying trade among themselves, by transferring modern technology to their own countries and by securing ready access for manufactured goods to the markets of developed countries.\n16.\tDeveloped nations ought to liberalize their economic policies towards the less-developed nations and foster deliberate co-operation, combined with a political will, to alleviate some of the harsh external factors over which the developing countries have no control.\n17.\tI now wish to reiterate Swaziland's commitment and determination to maintain non-alignment and our readiness to safeguard the legitimate rights of all men, irrespective of color, race or creed.\n18.\tFinally, this Organization has one thing to hold most precious: it is the future. We can together, as Members of this unique body, summon enough courage, with the experience of the past 26 years, to release ourselves from the tyranny of the present and, with this earth's wonderful resources, to lift humanity to heights of freedom, justice, peace, happiness and prosperity. That is the destiny to which all of us must strive. And that is the destiny of glory for mankind.\n"

        "file_name": "ALB_27_1972.txt",
        "file_text": "First, may I, Mr. President, express to you the congratulations of the Albanian delegation on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly.\n125.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, like most peace-loving Member States, would have wished to see during the period since the last session of the General Assembly of the United Nations important steps taken towards the creation of a sound and stable international situation, towards the restoration and respect of the sovereign rights of peoples. But the real state of affairs does not allow us to conclude that this wish has been fulfilled.\n126.\tIn international relations we observe new tensions caused by the violation of democratic principles and norms which govern relations among States. The American aggression in VietNam and the Israeli imperialist aggression in the Middle East go on. Many important problems of our time remain pending. The two great imperialist Powers, the United States of America and the Soviet Union, have launched a new and general attack against the interests of sovereign peoples and States. The world continues to live in the fear of the threat and the danger coming from those two powers.\n127.\tToday, everyone can easily understand that the United States and the Soviet Union have intensified and perfected their policy of interference and hegemony and have raised to a high level the co-ordination of their concrete activities against the freedom and independence of peoples. Those two Powers are in competition and rivalry for the division of the world into zones of influence and the domination of the world.\n128.\tAll Member States have witnessed the maneuvers of the two super-Powers to oppose, by every means, the efforts of peace-loving peoples and countries striving to strengthen and defend their independence and national sovereignty. But no publicity, no pacifist demeanor, no so-called \\\"great acts\\\" for the so-called \\\"safeguard of peace\\\" and \\\"progress of mankind\\\" can mask their well-known imperialist policy and the true designs they pursue separately or in common. We now see their open aggressiveness, their arrogance; everywhere we see their thirst for absolute power over the whole world.\n129.\tOf course, as was said by the leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha:\n\\\"It would be inconceivable and unrealistic to see in the Soviet-American alliance only the rapprochement and co-operation of the two super-Powers, their common actions and interests. In view of their imperialist character, the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union are also torn asunder by conflicts, rivalries and deep contradictions, which prevent them from acting always in harmony and in complete unity. The existence and aggravation of these contradictions are inherent in the very foundation of that alliance, the capitalist-socialist system of the two countries, and their imperialist designs. Preparing for war, the two parties also plan to devour one another.\\\"\n130.\tBut it is also true that peoples, especially small peoples, would run grave risks if they nourished the hope that one of the two great imperialist Powers could take them under its protection. That \\\"protection\\\" thus offered is in fact nothing but the integration of these peoples into the zones of influence of these two super-Powers, their domination and their exploitation by the latter.\n131.\tThe representatives of the two super-Powers present here have tried to convince us that the talks held between them and the agreements concluded during this year rendered a great service to the world and to the whole of mankind, and they presented the situation as if Member States should now feel more reassured than in the past, and so forth. This is nothing but a fiction, and we firmly reject it.\n132.\tDuring these talks decisions were taken which impinge upon the vital interests of the peoples of the world. Zones of influence have been confirmed and delimited. Important bargaining has taken place, and this to the prejudice of Viet-Nam, the Arab countries, the European countries and so on. Matters must be judged on the basis of facts, and the facts bear witness to the intensification of the aggressive global strategy of these two super-Powers, which is now carried out in the open, the preparation of new plans and dangerous conspiracies against the peoples and peace in the world.\n133.\tAt the present time, both the United States and the Soviet Union are trying to impose the idea that the two super-Powers would be incontrovertible guarantors of peace in the world and arbiters without appeal in international relations, that peoples should sacrifice their national interests for the maintenance of the balance between the two great Powers, upon which the balance of our planet is in turn predicated. These two Powers claim that the destinies of the world, of peace and of international security entirely depend upon them and upon the development of their reciprocal relations and that the improvement or the deterioration of the climate of Soviet-American relations conditions the climate of the whole globe and so on. It has become the practice for the two super-Powers to discuss important international problems directly between themselves and to decide them in accordance with their hegemonic interests without consulting or informing anyone not even their closest allies. Have not their Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and their negotiations on other delicate problems revealed this truth? Nobody claims to know all that is being hatched during these ultra-secret negotiations, but everybody knows full well that not only is a common armaments policy determined in these talks but also a common line and attitude towards others, in all fields and on all matters.\n134.\tThrough their policy of hegemony, the American and Soviet imperialists, not content with attempting to create in others a psychosis of fear and of submission to their potential, strength, are also trying openly to deprive peace-loving countries of the possibility of taking part in the solution of problems of concern and interest to the whole world, and to induce these countries to allow the two great Powers to decide behind their backs, in particular behind the backs of the smallest, even questions of direct concern to them. In short, they claim that peoples should abandon their supreme, sovereign rights to the \\\"two great Powers\\\". But the peace-loving peoples and countries reject these hegemonic and ultra-chauvinistic preachings and conceptions and firmly oppose the great-Power policy which the United States and the Soviet Union are attempting to impose upon them right here in the United Nations.\n135.\tNow, both the two great imperialist Powers and some others claim that the situation in Europe has undergone an important positive development and that conditions have been created for achieving complete and general security on that continent. To convince us of that, we are being reminded, among other things, of the Bonn-Moscow and Bonn-Warsaw Treaties, the Agreement on Berlin and so on.\n136.\tThis whole picture does not reflect reality. In fact, nothing has changed in Europe. On the contrary, the aforementioned agreements have given rise to new tensions, and to the old contradictions, in the East as in the West, others have been added. The United States, the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany have redoubled their efforts to acquire dominating positions and new privileges to the detriment of other sovereign European countries.\n137.\tWe are of the view that it would be unrealistic to speak of the possibilities of achieving European security when in Europe the United States and the Soviet Union pursue a policy of hegemony and maintain the aggressive military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, when on the territories of European countries, they have built up a whole network of military bases, where they maintain a large number of troops and organize successive military maneuvers; when Czechoslovakia is still occupied and when the theory of \\\"limited sovereignty\\\" is being applied in the countries of Eastern Europe; and when closed European economic groupings, in Eastern and Western Europe, practice discrimination in the field of trade and have become an obstacle to the development of equal co-operation among European countries.\n138.\tWe remain faithful also to the viewpoint according to which peace in the world is one and indivisible. There cannot be peace in one part of the world as long as a war of aggression is being waged in another. True peace and security in Europe are inconceivable as long as quite near Europe in the Middle East open aggression and unprecedented imperialist intervention continue; as long as, in the south of the continent in the Mediterranean basin, aggression is increasing by dint of the presence of the aggressive fleets of the United States and the Soviet Union and their military naval bases.\n139.\tIn these circumstances, the Albanian delegation would raise the following questions. Why have these aggressive fleets come to the Mediterranean from a distance of thousands of miles without being invited by anyone? Why do they cruise from one end of this sea to the other, aiming their guns at the peaceful shores of the Mediterranean countries and bringing with them the threat of war?\n140.\tThe peoples of these countries do not need the defense or the mendacious friendship of American and Soviet imperialists. They know full well the meaning of the mission of these fleets and of the \\\"gunboat diplomacy\\\" of the imperialist Powers in this zone. The fact is that the Mediterranean peoples are showing an ever-increasing opposition to the stationing of American and Soviet warships and troops in this zone and to foreign military bases on their shores, and their struggle to turn the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and co-operation is intensifying. They will unfailingly achieve their noble aspirations and bring to heel these new aspirants to the dominion of the seas.\n141.\tThe People's Republic of Albania, which expelled the Soviet social-imperialists from its waters when they tried to establish themselves on its shores and become the masters of the country, welcomes and supports the just positions of the peace-loving Mediterranean countries and their legitimate efforts to defend their independence and national sovereignty and free this basin from any policy of hegemony. As in the past, Albania will continue to contribute to efforts in this direction, it considers that the only effective way for the Mediterranean peoples to achieve their aspirations and their will is to take initiatives and undertake energetic and concrete actions. Let the Mediterranean countries on whose territories there are military bases declare that they will liquidate them; let the other Mediterranean countries proclaim that they will not tolerate the establishment of any new foreign military bases on their territories; let the Mediterranean countries which offer to American and Soviet war fleets any facilities and the temporary use of their ports for revictualling, repairs or as a resting place undertake not to assist these fleets in any way; let the Mediterranean countries which now receive visits from these fleets no longer accept them in the future.\n142.\tWe think that the implementation of these resolute measures would constitute an important contribution to easing tension and eliminating the existing danger in the Mediterranean, tend to strengthen the national sovereignty of the Mediterranean countries, and also be a positive factor for the consolidation of true peace and security in Europe.\n143.\tThat peace and security which the United States and the Soviet Union advocate for Europe is a peace and security which they need in order to consolidate their zones of influence, to preserve their pacts and their military bases and to guarantee the stationing of their troops on the territories of European countries. The \\\"tranquility\\\" they promise to create in Europe means security on their flanks so that they can direct the spearhead of their aggressive policy towards the East, especially towards the People's Republic of China.\n144.\tBefore speaking of European security, we must clarify this question. Against whom must the peoples of Europe protect themselves, and what are the forces which represent an actual and possible danger? The true and actual danger for Europe at present and in the future comes from the two super-Powers and the German revenge- seekers, and it is against them that the peoples of Europe must be protected. There has never been, and cannot be, any abstract theoretical security. Security is always concrete. It tends to protect against a well-determined threat. To establish European security as proposed and formulated by Moscow and Washington would be tantamount to sanctioning the imperialist interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe, leaving them full leeway to act militarily against peace-loving peoples and nations in other parts of the world. In these conditions, we consider that support for initiatives such as the convening of a conference on European security would facilitate the task of the two super-Powers in their efforts to establish their domination in Europe. A conference organized and manipulated by the American imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists would bring nothing but words and demagoguery and contribute nothing good to European peace and security. It would create and foster nefarious illusions harmful to the effective defense of the freedom and independence of the European peoples.\n145.\tThe convening of a conference on European security and preparations for its organization are a part of the Soviet-American collusion that was fully shaped during the most recent talks between the two super-Powers. These preparatory activities and any decisions that might emerge from the conference will bear the tint and seal of the attempts at hegemony of the two super-Powers.\n146.\tWe should like to stress that, in the atmosphere of delusion with which the two super-Powers have surrounded the preparations for the conference, some countries which will supposedly take part in it seem to nourish the hope that it will bring them political, economic and other advantages. But we believe that sooner or later these hopes will be dashed, for the two super-Powers will make no concession likely to affect their important mutual interests. All the strings of the conference are in their hands. That is the reason for the wariness and hesitation of various countries about the convening of that conference.\n147.\tThe People's Republic of Albania is opposed to that kind of \\\"European security\\\". True peace and security in Europe will be achieved only by the concerted efforts of all the peace-loving peoples and countries of Europe, which must themselves take over this cause, strengthen their national independence and their defensive capabilities, oppose unhesitatingly any policy of hegemony and any aggressive activity of the military blocs on their continent and in the neighboring areas, fight to the end for the liquidation of military bases and the withdrawal of foreign troops from their territories, while closely linking the fight for their own security to that of all the peoples of the world.\n148.\tWe have been witnessing of late a further intensification of the common activity of the United States and the Soviet Union in the so-called field of disarmament, and a great effort on their part to give the impression that they have seriously undertaken this task. All the hullabaloo on the disarmament question is nothing but a smoke-screen to conceal their true designs and to cover up their unbridled arms race. The latest Soviet-American agreements on the so-called limitation of strategic arms, which is being presented to us as a great historical event and a remarkable contribution to peace, far from being a step towards true disarmament and infringing in any way the nuclear monopoly of the two super-Powers, on the contrary encourages them to strengthen their predominant position and their technical and scientific superiority in the field of armaments as well as to maintain the gap they strive to keep between themselves and others. These agreements are a new stage in the continuing arms race through the further perfecting of the strategic nuclear arsenal of the superPowers. And in practice we realize that, while speaking of disarmament, the super-Powers multiply their efforts to arm themselves and increase their military budgets and their armed forces throughout the world, outside their national borders, and that, while they talk about the limitation of strategic nuclear weapons, they increase and perfect their destructive power and increase their expenditures in the field of scientific and technological research in order to invent new weapons of mass destruction.\n149.\tThe Albanian delegation considers that it is not the small States and specific areas that should be asked to disarm, because it is not the small States or those areas\u2014for example, it is not the Balkans or other areas, no matter where they may be located-which today threaten international peace and security. True disarmament must begin, in the first place, with the two super-Powers, because it is they who, through their aggressive policy, have become a permanent source of tension and a threat to the freedom and independence of sovereign States. To approach and consider the question of disarmament as advocated by the United States and the Soviet Union would be tantamount to raising the question in a false light and to making the struggle for disarmament a meaningless activity.\n150.\tIf the two super-Powers seriously wish to translate their disarmament declarations into deeds, let them do so by concrete and effective action; let them put an end to their policy of war and aggression; let them undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons; let them undertake to prohibit the production and use of those weapons and to destroy them completely in accordance with the relevant well-known proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China; let them embark on the road towards the destruction of weapons of mass destruction; let them reduce their armed forces to the levels required by their national defense interests; let them withdraw within their national borders all the troops and fleets they maintain abroad; let them put an end to their practice of extending military bases on the territory of other countries; let them liquidate existing military bases abroad; let them break up their aggressive military blocs and put an end to the arms race under any guise whatever.\n151.\tWe have no illusions as to the concrete and actual steps which the two Powers would be ready to take in the field of disarmament. The aggressive nature of American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism remains unchanged and armaments are one of the conditions of the existence of their system. That is why the convening of the world disarmament conference proposed by the Soviet Union is but a propaganda maneuver designed to pass the time by listening to empty speeches, to delude the world, and to give that country an opportunity to act against the peoples of the world and against peace.\n152.\tWe consider that peace-loving countries that hold dear the interests of their peoples, of peace and of international security must not let themselves be drawn into the dangerous whirlwind which has been intentionally created by the imperialists, but must redouble their vigilance and fight against die false illusions spread by the two imperialist Powers on disarmament and on the advantages which would supposedly accrue therefrom to the different countries as a result of the resources released by disarmament. They must increase their defensive military potential and multiply their self-defense efforts in order to be in a position to face possible attack as well as the permanent threat to their independence and freedom stemming from the aggressive policy of the United States and the Soviet Union. The peoples do not expect true disarmament from the two great imperialist Powers. They will achieve it through a resolute struggle against them and their imperialist conspiracy.\n153.\tAt the very center of world public opinion we find, as in the past, Viet-Nam and IndoChina, where die United States of America for many years has been continuing its infamous aggression. World public opinion has severely condemned the barbarous and inhuman acts of the American army, insistently demanding that an end be put forthwith to United States armed intervention, that American soldiers immediately leave South Viet-Nam and the IndoChinese peninsula and that the VietNamese people be left free to settle its own national problems, without any foreign interference and in accordance with its own wishes. But, in defiance of the will of all peoples and of all international principles and rules, the United States Government continues its aggression with unheard-of obstinacy and cynicism. Now the United States is in an impasse and, stunned by successive defeats, it goes from one crime to another, from one mistake to another. The serious situation in which it finds itself in Viet-Nam has not been lightened by the new measures of intensification and VietNamization of the war or by the successive escalations of criminal aggression against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. The mining and blockading of ports and the destruction of dikes accompanied by demagogic promises about the so-called withdrawal of American troops from Viet-Nam and the disengagement of the United States from IndoChina-promises to which President Nixon is now resorting for the purposes of his electoral campaign-have not yielded and will not yield any result. The words of the #United States President that he wants to achieve the withdrawal of his troops from Viet-Nam and IndoChina are nothing but a delusion which can deceive only the naive. It is quite clear now that the United States, through armed aggression and diplomatic maneuvers, is striving to reach its well-known objective in that part of the world, to make\nSouth Viet-Nam, like the other parts of the IndoChinese peninsula, a base of aggression against the peace-loving countries of South-East Asia as well as against the national liberation movements in the area.\n154.\tIn the pursuance of these objectives, the United States does not cease to benefit from the assistance of the Soviet leaders, who, in turn, make their own calculations and seek to draw advantages from this problem which concerns the whole world. While they say they are the great champions of Viet-Nam, the Soviet leaders have never ceased to exert pressure on the VietNamese people, to sabotage and restrain their just struggle in order to save the United States from the shameful defeat awaiting it in Viet-Nam, as they do moreover in regard to the struggle for the liberation of the people of Cambodia, by maintaining their links with the Lon Nol clique and not recognizing the legitimate Chief of State, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, the sole and true legitimate representative of the Cambodian people.\n155.\tRecent events have brought clearly to light the whole of the collusion on Viet-Nam between the United States and the Soviet Union. There can be no other interpretation of the attitude of the Soviet leaders, who not only did not lift a little finger when President Nixon of the United States proclaimed the mining and blockade of the ports of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and launched air attacks of unprecedented magnitude against that country but have used these American actions as a pretext to stop the small supply of military assistance that they may have sent it. The war in Viet-Nam has in no way altered the American- Soviet idyll and the state of relations between the two super-Powers, which are agreed that the people of Viet-Nam should not achieve their freedom and independence and that the Americans should not be expelled from Viet-Nam and IndoChina.\n156.\tBut the people of Viet-Nam have not permitted and will never permit others to play with the blood of their sons fallen on the field of honor; they are determined to fight-in unity with the peoples of Cambodia and Laos while benefiting from the powerful support of the great Chinese people and from international solidarity with the peace-loving peoples of the world to win the final victory over the imperialist American aggressors and solve their own problems, as they have decided to do in keeping with their supreme national interests. There is no doubt that a true and just peace will be established in Viet-Nam and throughout IndoChina and it will be achieved through the resolute struggle of the heroic peoples of IndoChina. It will be obtained only when the United States is compelled completely and definitely and without conditions to withdraw its aggressive troops from that area, when it dismantles its bases and withdraws its military equipment, when it ceases to encourage and give support to its henchmen in IndoChina.\n157.\tThe development of events in the Middle East in the current year has again shown not only that the aggression against the Arab Republic of Egypt, Syria and other peaceful Arab countries continues but that the Israeli Zionists are embarking more and more along this course and insist obstinately on their absurd expansionist claims and ambitions in regard to such countries. While in the occupied Arab territories they practice an unbridled policy of de-nationalization and apply racism, on the political level, starting from positions of strength, they seek to legalize the fruits of armed aggression and to dictate their will to the Arab peoples. In the meantime the United States does not cease to give Israel unreserved political and moral support and to supply it with the most modern weapons in unlimited quantities. The Soviet Union, although it passes for a champion of the just cause of the Arab peoples, indulges in a double play and creates obstacles for them in their just struggle for the liberation of the occupied territories and the defense of their national interests, which is tantamount to encouraging openly the Israeli Zionists to continue their aggression. While the United States provides Israel with weapons, the Soviet Union for its part supplies it with a qualified live force by sending to that country tens of thousands of Soviet Jews. The two partners thus jointly satisfy the needs of Israel, enabling it to continue its aggression against the Arab States. The Soviet Union, in connivance with the United States, has endeavored and still endeavors entirely and definitely to liquidate the Palestinian affair.\n158.\tThe two super-Powers have never been in favor of a true solution of the Middle East problem. In keeping with the objectives of their over-all strategy in that area, they speculate on the temporary difficulties of the Arab countries and, as can be seen also from their recent common attitude, they do the impossible to maintain the situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" as it is called, which means the maintenance of their positions and their political, economic and military influence in that area.\n159.\tThe leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, at the Sixth Congress of the Labor PArty of Albania, held in November last year, stated:\n\\\"The Zionists, the imperialists and the revisionists endeavor to divide the Arabs and to sow discord among them, with the intent of weakening their common front of anti-imperialist liberation and imposing on them a peace that is contrary to their vital interests. The two super-Powers, which seek to take into their hands the destinies of the Middle East and to play there the role of arbiter, propose to divide it into zones of influence and to build on the ruins of the Arab peoples new bases from which they would set out on new conquests in the Asian and African continent.\n\\\"But if the Arab peoples have fought for centuries for their freedom and independence, for the defense of their honor and their property, it is not in order to sacrifice them now to the imperialist interests of the great Powers. The price of the peace that the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists offer them is very high. Further, it is an insult to them and a serious affront to the glorious traditions, the dignity and pride of all the Arab peoples. Those peoples have clearly made it known that they will not renounce even an inch of Arab land and that there will be no bargaining on the Palestinian question.\\\"\n160.\tThe recent measures adopted by the Arab Republic of Egypt to expel the Soviet advisers and military experts dealt a serious blow to the Soviet expansionist policy in the\nMiddle East; they revealed the dangerous conspiracies that the Soviet social-imperialists are plotting with the American imperialists against the Arab peoples and the other peoples.\n161.\tThese measures represent an important step towards the consolidation of Egypt's independence and State sovereignty and once again confirm what we, the Albanians, have been saying for a long time, namely, that the Soviet revisionists do not give their weapons to the Arab States to help them in their struggle against Zionist imperialist aggression, but rather to tie their hands and to become tomorrow the masters of those countries in order to install themselves at their ease in the Middle East. We have said this not from drawing abstract, political conclusions but also and above all by drawing our conclusions from the hostile policy of the Soviet Khrushchevian revisionists who have sought to occupy our ports and turn Albania into an arsenal for their own ends. But the Albanian people have unhesitatingly unmasked their diabolical plans.\n162.\tThe lesson to be drawn from recent events in Egypt is that sovereign peoples and countries cannot rely on the weapons and \\\"assistance\\\" provided by the two great imperialist Powers who seek to impose on them their domination.\n163.\tThe Soviet leaders are not in the habit of speaking of their defeats. That is why, again this time, they attempt to minimize the whole affair. They present things as if the military advisers expelled from Egypt \\\"have acquitted themselves with honor of their tasks and are now going back home\\\". One may well wonder what tasks they acquitted themselves of with honor? Would it be by chance their attempt to halt the Arab peoples in their just struggle for the liberation of the occupied territories, or would it be their attempt to maintain in the Middle East the status quo, which favors Israel and the Soviet- American designs of expansion.\n164.\tPeace in the Middle East will not be instituted either by the United States or the Soviet Union, nor by these two Powers together, nor by resolutions adopted on their initiative nor through missions proposed and manipulated by them, but by the firm struggle of the Arab peoples, in close unity, against the Zionist aggressors and the plots of the two super-Powers. The Israeli aggressors must definitely and without conditions leave all the occupied Arab territories and put an end to their policy of aggression and armed provocation against the peace-loving Arab peoples. The Palestinian rights must be recognized and restored.\n165.\tThe peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America aspire, like all peoples, to live in freedom and independence, to become masters within their frontiers. But, despite the great changes that have taken place and are taking place, the imperialist Powers do not renounce their old colonial possessions and brutally apply there the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. That is why the whole of Africa is in ferment today and everywhere we witness armed liberation struggles for the liberation and independence of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), the Cape Verde Islands, Namibia, and South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Northern Ireland patriots fight, weapons in hand, against colonial oppression and the terror of the British leading circles. The People of Puerto Rico stubbornly seek to shake off the imperialist yoke. In the United States itself, rebellion and the movement of protest of the blacks against racial discrimination do not cease to grow and expand.\n166.\tThe imperialist Powers, and first of all the United States and the Soviet Union, obstinately apply a very marked neo-colonialist policy. They exploit and plunder other peoples, particularly those that have recently acquired freedom from colonial oppression.\n167.\tIt is not my intention to dwell at length here on the forms of domination and the hateful practices of these Powers in those countries, but, as the representative of a country the noble principle underlying whose policy is the support of peoples fighting for freedom and independence, I cannot remain silent in the face of the fact that these countries are the object of the greed of neo-colonialists who threaten their political independence and sovereignty, nor can I fail at the same time to express the full solidarity of our people with their just, anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle.\n168.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union have already agreed and co-ordinated their action relating to their so-called aid to other countries. All their assistance is subordinated to political and military conditions and is calculated to preserve intact the status quo in the distribution of their zones of influence, to hinder the extension of national liberation struggles, and to prevent the creation of situations which might endanger the interests of the super-Powers.\n169.\tWe applaud the struggle of the peaceful countries of Latin America and other countries which defend their national and territorial integrity and national jurisdiction against the hegemonic designs of the two super-Powers. We firmly support the just measures taken by Algeria, Iraq, Libya and other main petroleum-producing countries, as well as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and other Latin American countries, and countries of Africa and Asia, to defend their independence and sovereignty, as well as their property and their national rights. The People's Republic of Albania will never cease to support their just cause.\n170.\tPeace-loving peoples and countries are strong enough to stand up to the threat and dangers to which the two super-Powers subject them, and we are convinced that that firm resolve to defend their honor and independence cannot be destroyed by any Power however great and strongly armed it may be. The great People's China, that great socialist Power which is developing rapidly and continues to move forward, has become a great factor of peace and security in the world. It represents a definite support for the struggle of peoples and countries for freedom and national independence and social progress an insurmountable obstacle to the aggressive hegemony plans of the two super-Powers.\n171.\tThe whole of progressive mankind enthusiastically applauded last year the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, a glowing victory of the great Chinese People's Republic and of its just external policy, and at the same time a victory for all the peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world. That was the crowning of the struggle that Member States, including the People's Republic of Albania, have carried on unceasingly for over 20 years to put an end to the unprecedented situation that had been created in our Organization.\n172.\tThe presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has notably strengthened the struggle of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist forces even here in the Organization, as well as the struggle of peace-loving member States against the two great imperialist Powers and in favor of the defense of the rights of peoples and the cause of peace. But with the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations only a first step, although an important one, was taken along the path leading to the enhancement of the authority and effectiveness of the Organization. Many other measures will have to be adopted in order that the Organization may live up to the provisions of the Charter and the demands of our times.\n173.\tWe note that the United Nations is still powerless to fulfill the tasks for which it was created, to make its contribution to the solution of important problems that are of concern to the world today. This is borne out by many recent and numerous events. The inability of the United Nations was clearly manifested in the case of the armed aggression perpetrated by India last year, with the support of the Soviet social-imperialists, against Pakistan, an aggression that led to the brutal dismemberment of the territory of a sovereign Member State. Now we are asked to recognize and legalize that situation created by violence. That inability or ineffectiveness is clearly noticeable, too, in the failure of efforts to solve the Middle East question; in the interminable debates on disarmament; in the legalization thereby of many dangerous conspiracies of the two super-Powers; in the non-implementation of many decisions concerning colonial problems, and so on.\n174.\tOur Organization's past and present inadmissible attitude in regard to the peace-loving Korean people is also obvious proof of its weakness and the deadlock in which it finds itself. Everyone knows not only that the United Nations has been used to cover up the barbarous aggression of the United States and its allies against the Korean people, but also that its flag serves even today to camouflage the maintenance in South Korea of American aggressive troops, which have brought to the population of that part of Korea untold suffering and misery, which constantly indulge in armed provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and aggravate tension in the Far East. The existence, for 20 years, of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea constitutes another aspect of the flagrant interference of the United Nations in the internal affairs of the Korean people and is a clear violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter.\n175.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, condemning once again most strongly the serious acts committed against the Korean people, emphasizes that if the Organization wishes to make its contribution to this question, it must as soon as possible adopt the decision demanded for a long time, first of all by the Korean people \nbut also by all peace-loving peoples, to dissolve without delay the unlawful Commission on Korea and immediately to withdraw American aggressive troops from South Korea. Those are the first urgent measures to be adopted. Only thus can we prevent discrediting further this Organization on this question. The Korean people must be left free to decide its own destiny in accordance with its wishes and without any interference from outside and to realize its legitimate national aspirations and the reunification of its country.\n176.\tIn the opinion of the Albanian delegation it is also necessary to restore without delay the legitimate rights of the Kingdom of Cambodia, whose place in the United Nations must be occupied by representatives of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, the only legitimate representatives of the Cambodian people. This requires the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Lon Nol clique. As for the request for the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Lon Nol clique, such a decision would be in keeping with the tenets of justice, the sovereign right of the people of Cambodia and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.\n177.\tThe present international situation and the interests of enhancing and strengthening the capacity and role of the United Nations impose on all its Member States, and all those who are attached to the fundamental principles of its Charter and who respect them, the need to co-ordinate their efforts and to intensify their struggle to free the United Nations from the American-Soviet maneuvers and to place it on the right course.\n178.\tThose were some of the main problems in the international situation on which the delegation of Albania wished to express the point of view of its Government. But at the beginning of the work of this session the question of terrorism was raised, and the United States delegation made a lot of noise about it.\n179.\tOur attitude concerning terrorism is well known. We do not approve of it. But the Albanian delegation could not fail to highlight the fact that the timing and manner of presentation of this question show that the aim is, in the name of \\\"the struggle against terrorism\\\", to strike at the national liberation struggles,\\\" the sacred right of peoples to use every means to fight to recover and safeguard their freedom and independence. It is clear that the United States and those who support it are endeavoring to use this question to distract world public opinion from the monstrous crimes which they are committing in Viet-Nam and throughout Indochina, the barbarous acts of terror perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people, Lebanon, and all the other Arab peoples, the savage racial oppression and genocide practiced in certain African countries, and so forth.\n180.\tPeace-loving Member States must not be hoodwinked by American maneuvers, but must unmask the true terror, the crimes and barbarous acts of the imperialists. They must struggle against the policy of aggression and expansion, against the policy of oppression and colonial exploitation which have brought untold suffering and misery to the world.\n181.\tThe People's Republic of Albania which consistently follows a just foreign policy of principle, of resolute defense of the lofty interests of the Albanian people, of unreserved support for the struggle of peoples and sovereign countries for their freedom, national independence and social progress and for peace and international co-operation-will, as in the past, always side with peace-loving peoples and countries and will spare no effort to help them to achieve the triumph of their common cause, to accede to genuine peace and ensure the defense of their supreme national interests. At this session once again, the Albanian delegation, in conformity with this just attitude of its socialist country, will unite its efforts with those of the delegations of other progressive countries and will make its fullest contribution to the realization of these high and noble objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr.President, I should like first of all to congratulate you warmly on your election as President of this, the twenty-seventh session, of the General Assembly, which is an indication of the high esteem in which you and your country are held. Your country's great contribution to international affairs and your own untiring efforts in promoting goodwill among nations have both been fittingly rewarded by this Assembly.\n112.\tThe deep appreciation of my delegation is also extended to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, for the admirable manner in which he guided the deliberations of this Assembly during its twenty-sixth session.\n113.\tTo the Secretary-General my delegation also wishes to offer congratulations on his appointment to a most exacting job. He has already given proof that he possesses those qualities of mind and spirit which will be of inestimable value in dealing with the immense problems confronting our Organization. Barbados pledges him its unstilted support as he strives to uphold the principles of the Charter and to implement directives of this Organization and its related agencies.\n114.\tAt this time of the year the delegations here assembled sometimes enjoy the privilege of welcoming those new States admitted into the family of nations. My delegation very much regrets that it is not able on this occasion to welcome a delegation from Bangladesh. Barbados was one of the first two countries in the world certainly the first in the Western Hemisphere to recognize the sovereignty of the people of Bangladesh. We hope that this Organization will not repeat the craven blunder which for 20 spiteful years excluded from our family the largest single section of humanity, whose claim to be in full control of its own affairs was always beyond dispute. It is better to count heads than to break them, and for this reason my delegation looks forward to welcoming Bangladesh to this Organization in the very near future. As we bring more sovereign States into the United Nations we provide greater contentment for and,, hopefully, easier dispersal of, their suspicions and frustrations.\n115.\tBarbados is pleased to note the very positive steps which some countries have taken in the past year to resolve their differences with others. The great Powers have negotiated with one other and have defined their common interests without, according to the communiques, sacrificing the vital interests of other States. Any accord, however tenuous, which exists among the nuclear Powers must be complemented by a greater willingness on their part to understand that world peace needs a more solid foundation than they seem disposed at the moment to give it. Not to blow the world up shows commendable restraint on their part, but my delegation feels that the purely negative virtue of self-preservation ought to give way to the more positive one of wanting peace for its own sake.\n116.\tIt is in this context that we note with satisfaction the attempts being made by the two Korean States and the two\nGermanys to talk with each other. We hope that these dialogs will continue until mutual interests are distilled, and that other States will not cumber them with gratuitous, selfish and wrongheaded advice. It would be as well if the two VietNams or what is left of each of them could talk to each other to discover whose war they are waging, and whether the great Powers whose proxies they are would permit them to bring it to an end, or whether the great Powers would transfer it to their respective soils. My delegation also hopes that the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 reached between India and Pakistan will hold firm and lead to an enduring peace among the peoples of those two great Asian States.\n117.\tWe have enough realism to known that these accords do not suggest that final solutions to these problems have been reached. But we are certain that these halting but welcome successes have come from the conference table and not from the battlefield. Where there has been persistence in dialog and patience in discussion, something good has emerged. That is why this Assembly must continue to exhort all parties to a dispute, in all the tension-filled areas of the globe, to use the proven techniques of conciliation and negotiation.\n118.\tWe must also soften our rhetoric in our debates when we discuss areas of conflict and tension. If the truth must be told, we have not always helped a situation by taking sides in it when we should have been encouraging those in dispute to resolve their differences in accordance with the principles of the Charter. Great causes need to be thoroughly understood before they can be decently espoused, and it is always a better service to world peace if great and sensitive issues are debated with restraint and objectivity.\n119.\tThere is a widely held belief among nations that the maintenance of world peace is the special responsibility of the great Powers. It has a limited truth only because the great Powers have greater means at their disposal to breach the peace with impunity. But the maintenance of world peace is the responsibility of all States and it could well be that a genuine policy of non-alignment might encourage the great Powers to be more circumspect in the application of their selfish policies. My delegation therefore believes that all States should first contribute to the peace of their own immediate regions by pursuing peaceful policies with sir neighbors. Within our own hemisphere, for instance, we would wish to see new initiatives taken to end the isolation of the Republic of Cuba on the basis of mutual respect and tolerance, and we, would also wish to see our sister Caribbean State Belize achieve its independence with the positive goodwill of, and without demur from, its immediate neighbors. Outside our own region my delegation will strive with others to encourage the pacific settlement of disputes and we therefore in this session of the Assembly, as in previous ones, call upon the contestants in the Middle East to go to the conference table no matter what its shape or size and bring their tragic conflict to an end.\n120.\tEven while we wrestle with these difficulties, we meet under the shadow of a greater menace. Recent events in an international sports arena, in airports and aircraft and elsewhere have brought into focus the need to answer resolutely and swiftly those who commit cowardly and murderous acts of terrorism. My delegation condemns without equivocation the resort to murder as a political weapon and my Government would under no circumstances shelter or protect organizations or persons known to be or proved to be in sympathy with others who are so engaged. The political assassin is rarely a liberator and if there are countries and States which can make excuses for the seizure of aircraft and the infliction of needless terror upon innocent travelers by air, or can rationalize the cowardly slaughter of the diplomatic personnel of States, then those countries and States neither serve their own best interests nor strengthen their claim to be part of the civilized world. If terrorism is not struck down, then this Assembly will soon cease to be the voice of decency among the nations. No country will then be immune and those countries which even now will not condemn the terrorist will soon find themselves at his mercy because the nihilist will not distinguish between ideologies when the knife and the bomb quiver in his grasp.\n121.\tBarbados, with a tradition of respect for law and order, will support any action taken to stamp out this malignant growth and to erase this terrible blot on the conscience of mankind.\n122.\tBut terrorism, like peace, is indivisible. We must not suppose that there is greater immorality in blowing up an aircraft with innocent passengers than there is in the mindless brutalities which are heaped upon whole populations in southern Africa and sometimes elsewhere. In some countries the mere possession of a white skin confers unbridled license to inflict upon darker skins the most bestial assaults, of which the taking of life is perhaps the least unbearable. When States can commit acts of aggression against whole peoples in the name of a counterfeit philosophy of racism, and can do this in full defiance of world opinion, it should not astonish anyone that wicked all depraved individuals should plan and encompass the murder of others and even boast about it, while some States, whose agents they may be, nurse their guilty secrets in complacency. My delegation therefore calls once again upon this Assembly to condemn and outlaw all forms of assault upon human life and dignity, whether the aggressors are homeless and misguided robots, or whether they happen to be, for the time being, entrenched in the control or possession of States. This threat of terrorism and anarchy has always been with us and in our haste to utter a rightful condemnation of the new gangsterism we must show the same sense of urgency in rooting out the detestable racist regimes which exist in any part of Africa or elsewhere.\n123.\tThere is a necessary connexion between the ills we condemn and the economic injustice yet another form of terrorism which is suffered by the majority of States. Hundreds of millions of human beings in Asia, in Africa and in Latin America still live-if that is the word for it-in great but still unfulfilled expectations of a fairer share of the world's trade. At the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Chile earlier this year, while the rich nations were prepared to discuss freely how hungry nations were to be fed, or how the primary commodities of poor countries were to bring good prices in the markets of the few, those same nations were not prepared to make the decent political commitments which would help developing countries. They had no sooner left Santiago than they set about stiffening the terms of trade by all those artifices which are designed further to impoverish the already poor countries. They manipulate the world's currencies always to their own convenience and would have us believe that the world's future depends on what artificial values they choose to bestow upon the bits of metal or paper which they use to siphon off the profits of the world's trade into their own countries. They scurry to one another's capitals to decide how the world should be run, and, inevitably, their decisions decree that the peasant in Africa or Asia or Latin America must pay more for goods and services produced in a few countries, but must sell, if he can, what he produces at prices which drive him further below the poverty line.\n124.\tAs if that were not enough, the richer nations have devised yet another means of pauperizing the rest of the world. Not long ago we heard many pious resolutions about the allocation of 1 per cent of their gross domestic product to raise the rest of us above the poverty line. A few countries equal to the number of people who could stand in a telephone booth have honorably tried to meet this obligation. A few others were lavish in promise of aid and have fulfilled their promises by tying their assistance to such burdensome restrictions that recipient countries either have refused the help or have impoverished themselves further by accepting it.\n125.\tIt is no accident of history that the world's major trading and financial powers are precisely those which once held great empires or extended their military and economic influence beyond their patrimonial seas. Old habits die hard and the cynical substitution of \\\"spheres of affluence\\\" for \\\"spheres of influence\\\" is but the new method of controlling the world without the vulgar necessity of having to govern it.\n126.\tA very casual glance at the conditions laid down by the European Economic Community for association with it, or even for selling anything to its members, will indicate that this venture may well become a conspiracy in restraint of world trade.\n127.\tIt will be the duty of this Organization and its agencies to search out and, if not prevented, find solutions to the problems of international economic development. The agencies must develop proper insights into the question of poverty in the under-developed world. They must take note of the different levels of development, but they are not entitled to categorize some poor countries as well off merely because their pride and industry inhibits them from passing around their begging bowls.\n128.\tWhile the poor nations struggle to find some redress to the prevailing economic imbalances, the resources of the sea and the immense wealth that lies in the ocean bed and the subsoil thereof have presented some glimmer of hope. In June this year, Barbados, with other Caribbean countries, while stressing that the resources of the sea, sea-bed and subsoil of the maritime areas within their jurisdiction and adjacent to their coasts can help to improve the living standards of our peoples and accelerate progress in our countries, recognized the need to preserve and protect these resources. For not only are these resources being contaminated and polluted, but they are already being exploited and utilized to increase the wealth of those nations which by their manipulations pauperize the rest of the world.\n129.\tThe immediate need to regulate the use of and preserve and protect the marine resources makes it urgent that arrangements be concluded for the international conference on the law of the sea.\n130.\tToday more than ever there is need for the United Nations to act with determination to meet the ideals of peace, justice and progress enshrined in its Charter. Even while the Organization is preoccupied with adopting measures to arrest the wave of disrespect for human life, which has reached alarming proportions, greater efforts must be expanded to overcome the frustrations of the many peoples of this world and bring into reality their desire for a better life.\n131.\tAll States Members of this Organization must assist in this regard.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I offer you on behalf of India our most cordial congratulations on your election as the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. By electing you, the Member States have recognized your own skill and wisdom and have also honored the struggles and achievements of the Polish people. India has had close and friendly relations with Poland, and I wish to assure you of our fullest co-operation as you discharge your responsibilities.\n47.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to our outgoing President, Adam Malik, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, for the patience and devotion with which he guided our work during the last session.\n48.\tWe recall the long years of dedicated service which U Thant gave to the United Nations and for which he will always be remembered with affection and admiration. At the same time, we greet our Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim. His dynamism and his high sense of purpose had been recognized even before his election at the end of our last session. Since then his tireless efforts in the exercise of his duties have earned him high respect. We wish him continued success.\n49.\tIn India, we are celebrating this year the twenty-fifth anniversary of our independence. As a result of the long struggle of our people, we became independent in the year 1947. In the years that followed, the freedom of most countries from colonial domination was achieved and a community of interest in justice and progress began to grown among the newly independent countries. In the quarter of a century that has since passed, we have had our share of difficulties and successes. Today we are more united and determined than we have ever been before in the last 25 years. Our faith in our democracy has become deeper, our goals for the betterment of our people are clearer, and our resolution to achieve them has become firmer. We realize that basically we must rely on our own values and resources in order to strengthen our economy and to accelerate the pace of our development. The bulk of the burden must fall on us as indeed it has fallen on us in the past. At the same time we believe that international co-operation is vitally necessary if humanity as a whole is to be freed from poverty and want. Our unfinished revolution in India will not be completed until full economic and social justice is assured for all our people. In this spirit, we seek nothing but co-operation and friendship with all, on a basis of equality.\n50.\tIndia adheres firmly to the policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. This does not, and cannot, mean an exact middle position between any two extreme views on matters of international concern. India's policy of non-alignment is based on the need in the modern world to maximize the area of peace, reduce tension and ensure stability with justice. We believe in the sovereign parity of all nations; we accept the supremacy of none. Our friendship is open to all countries on the same terms. We trust in co-operation among equals, not in co-operation on the basis of domination by one country over another. This policy determines our attitude to all countries, and will continue to govern our relationship with our neighbors.\n51.\tThe last year has been marked by significant detente among nations, big and small. The meetings of leaders in Moscow and Peking, the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States, especially on the limitation of strategic arms, are helpful changes from the earlier and sterile, and at times dangerous, confrontations. In Europe many prospects for the reduction of tensions have opened up. Some of the recent events in Asia encourage the hope that our part of the world might also soon be moving towards greater understanding and co-operation. Our purpose in this improving situation will be to ensure that the momentum towards an ever-expanding area of understanding and accommodation is maintained.\n52.\tThe world at large is rejecting more and more the concepts of spheres of influence, under the guise of balance of power and of domination of smaller Powers by the mightier ones. In this context the Secretary-General has noted in his thoughtful introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Af8701jAdd. 1], that the idea of keeping peace and security through a concert of great Powers is outdated, if not outmoded. The current processes of detente can produce healthy and abiding results only when they do not ignore the interests of countries that are yet to participate in them. Non-aligned countries have long striven for such contacts and consultations as are now in fact taking place. At the same time they have repeatedly emphasized the risks to true independence if agreements are not concluded by broad-based consultations.\n53.\tA recent encouraging development has been the greater and more determined pursuit of bilateralism in the search for solutions to many international problems. In the past there were many instances when the interests of outside Powers prevented the settlement of problems which could have been achieved by mutual consultations among the parties directly concerned. Examples of this kind are not altogether absent in our time. Nevertheless, in areas as widely separated as Central Europe, North Africa, West Africa and Asia, agreements have been reached for solving a number of problems through the efforts of the countries directly concerned. The settlement of problems mutually and bilaterally can, we think, strengthen peace, security and independence.\n54.\tLooked at from this point of view, the recent developments in the relations between India and Pakistan mark a significant departure from past years, when hostility and suspicion were unfortunately the dominant features. Direct negotiations have provided a more dependable means by which we can settle and solve our problems to the benefit of the vast population of the region. In a sincere search for a durable peace and good-neighbourly relations, we opened negotiations with Pakistan last February which culminated in the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972. The two Governments have agreed that all problems between them should be settled by peaceful means through mutual consultations.\n55.\tThe President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India have pledged full support and expressed their complete determination for the faithful implementation of the Simla Agreement. For this purpose, further accords are to be arrived at by mutual consultation and discussion. The use of force has been totally abjured. They have also agreed that in Jammu and Kashmir the entire line of control as it existed at the time of ceasefire on 17 December 1971 will be respected by both sides. The two Governments have been taking steps to carry out this agreement and when some doubts and difficulties arose a few weeks ago, these too were resolved by direct negotiations. The military commanders have been meeting from time to time to work out the delineation of the line of control. Agreement on delineation has been arrived at practically everywhere except for a few small pockets where the total area involved is only a few square miles. We have offered to the Pakistan side to have joint inspection and survey, wherever necessary, in order to complete the delineation. We hope that the military commanders of the two sides will meet without any further delay to finalize delineation in the remaining small pockets by holding joint meetings, joint inspections and surveys whenever necessary. We hope that very shortly the entire line will be delineated. The completion of this task will, as already agreed, be followed by mutual withdrawal of troops. In the meantime, exchanges have been taking place of sick and wounded prisoners of war and of those civilians who came to be under the custody of India or Pakistan at the outbreak of hostilities on the western sector.\n56.\tThere are naturally several problems arising out of the armed conflict, and the two Governments have agreed that these problems, as also other basic unresolved matters between the two countries, would be settled by mutual agreement. A series of meetings at various levels is envisaged to achieve this objective. The welcome accorded to the Simla Agreement by the international community will sustain the efforts of the two Governments and their leaders to work patiently towards a durable peace.\n57.\tThe Simla Agreement is the first major fruitful step in the search for mutual understanding and co-operation between India and Pakistan. Its full and effective application should bring about conditions in both countries which will enable their peoples to utilize their resources and energies for the pressing task of advancing their welfare. The peoples of India and Pakistan have many common interests and aspirations and they would wish to live as good neighbors. The Simla Agreement has therefore been widely supported by the people of both the countries.\n58.\tThe emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country is destined to be of vital importance in strengthening peace, stability, security and progress in the subcontinent. We welcome Bangladesh as an equal partner in this common task of the countries of the region. The heroism and fortitude of the people of Bangladesh will be an invaluable asset in the reconstruction of their country.\n59.\tWe deeply regret that Bangladesh was not enabled to take its place at the opening of this session of the General Assembly. A country with 75 million people, it has been recognized by over 90 other sovereign States and has already found its rightful place in many international forums. The earliest admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations will further strengthen the United Nations system, will reinforce the principle of universality of our Organization, and will contribute to the more expeditious normalization of relations among the countries of the subcontinent and the achievement of peace and harmony in the area. We are convinced that this General Assembly can do much to bring this about, through reconsideration of Bangladesh's application by the Security Council.\n60.\tWe sincerely hope that, in the shortest possible time, Pakistan and Bangladesh will be able to solve all the problems between them with understanding and as equal sovereign States.\n61.\tWe view with deep satisfaction the fact that India's relations with other neighboring countries continue to grow in depth and so serve to help strengthen the forces of peace and progress in South Asia. The relations between China and India have not shown the necessary and expected improvement. On our part, we continue to be ready, as indeed we have indicated in the past, to resume normal relations with China and to improve them in our mutual interest and with mutual respect. Against the background of the normalization and detente that have taken place in Asia and in other parts of the world such an improvement in Sino-Indian relations is, in our opinion, all the more desirable.\n62.\tNaturally, I have taken a few minutes to explain at some length the significant developments on the Indian subcontinent, the state of our relations with some of our immediate neighbors, and the hopes for peace and progress they inspire. These issues are nearest to us. I must now deal briefly with some other vital international problems.\n63.\tThe presence in this hall of 132 States should make us doubly conscious of the absence of representatives of many large areas of the world which are still under colonial rule. Nor can we ignore the fact that in several countries rampant racism is being preached and practiced. The solution of these problems will require a degree of awareness and co-operation which are unfortunately still lacking. The Indian delegation will do its utmost to work out, together with the others, all such practical means as the United Nations can pursue. We shall continue to support the struggle for independence being carried out by the people of all colonial Territories, including Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). We will not relax our efforts to eliminate racial discrimination, whenever and wherever it appears. The meetings of the Security Council last winter at Addis Ababa provided an opportunity for focusing attention on these problems. We look forward with interest to the outcome of the Secretary-General's efforts with regard to Namibia and to the more effective use of the Commissioner and the Council for Namibia.\n64.\tThe situation that has now arisen in Uganda cannot but cause concern to all of us. The problems facing the Asians affected by the expulsion order are essentially humanitarian in character and can be solved only in a spirit of compassion and understanding. The people facing deportation should be afforded reasonable time to be able to wind up their affairs in an orderly manner and depart in safety. A vast majority of them have lived there for generations and they should be allowed to take with them their personal belongings and a reasonable amount of assets to enable them to restart their lives in other lands with some measure of hope and confidence. We hope that the Government of Uganda will respect these human considerations and do everything possible to discharge its responsibility towards the person and property of these unfortunate people and so lessen their hardship. Any help other countries can give in overcoming this problem will, of course, be most welcome; India, for its part, is doing all it can.\n65.\tWe must ensure that our solidarity in the common struggle against racial discrimination and colonial domination is not undermined. Since we all agree that racial discrimination is an evil to be fought, we, all of us, cannot but oppose it, whatever form it may take.\n66.\tTensions and frustrations continue to mount in the Middle East and indeed, as recent incidents have shown, are rising to unprecedented heights of senseless and savage reprisals and terror. The efforts of Ambassador Jarring and of our Secretary-General have not yet borne fruit and meanwhile Israel is persistently consolidating its position to the total detriment of Arab and Palestinian rights and interests. Israel has consistently obstructed all attempts at progress towards a peaceful solution of this problem as laid down in Security Council resolution 242(1967) and has created the situation, where threats to international peace and security are increasing daily and at times ominously. We would also ask why the permanent members of the Security Council have for months failed to meet in the face of this deteriorating situation and this grave problem.\n67.\tIndia stands firmly against interference by outside Powers aimed at preventing any people from determining its destiny or choosing its form of government in accordance with its own wishes. The tragedy in Viet-Nam is the prolonged denial, in the most brutal manner, of this basic right of the people. We cannot but strongly deplore and express dismay at the continued and ever-increasing bombardment and aerial bombing of innocent men, women and children, their cities, villages and homes, and the indiscriminate destruction of ports, industries, crops, forests and all other means of existence. We have consistently held and expressed the view for a long time that force and foreign military intervention cannot bring this problem to an end. This view is shared by a large and ever-increasing number of countries. Recent indications are that the United States of America has also come to accept this view. We believe that the seven-point proposal put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam provides a reasonable basis for peaceful negotiations. The continuance of bombing with savage intensity in Indochina in these circumstances must command our utmost opposition.\n68.\tWe regret the attitude of non-cooperation by Saigon, which holds out little hope of progress towards a peaceful settlement of this problem. The independence, integrity and non-alignment of the three States of Indochina are vital to the peace and progress of Asia. The Geneva accords  provided the framework within which these objectives could be achieved. The decision of the Saigon Government to refuse a visa to the Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in VietNam is in clear violation of its obligations.\n69.\tWe are disappointed that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has not been able to finalize even limited measures during the past year's deliberations. Bearing in mind the link between the strengthening of international security, disarmament and economic development, we expect that the objectives of cessation and reversal of the arms race, especially in nuclear armaments, the elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control will be vigorously pursued. Our general views supporting the convening of a world disarmament conference, after adequate preparation and with the participation of all States, have been made known and we look forward to a constructive debate during this session.\n70.\tOn the question of the strengthening of international security and related subjects, we are confident that our discussions will enable us to give effect, in a more practical and fruitful manner, to the ideas embodied in the Declaration itself [resolution 2734 (XXV)], with such further elaboration as may be necessary.\n71.\tThe adoption of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, is a welcome follow-up of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. The creation of zones of peace and co-operation, free from great-Power military rivalries and interventions, and the removal of bases conceived in that context, must be seen as part of legitimate regional efforts towards strengthening international security. My delegation would support the taking of further steps to give fuller meaning and substance to the Declaration and would co-operate with other delegations for this purpose.\n72.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm last June, has awakened hopes and fears at the same time. The prevention of pollution is a matter of common concern to the entire human race. But the developing countries cannot accept any line of reasoning which makes the prevention of pollution an excuse for slowing down growth in the poorer countries.\n73.\tAddressing the Conference, the Prime Minister of India pointed out that \\\"Environment cannot be improved in conditions of poverty. Nor can poverty be eradicated without use of science and technology.\\\"\n74.\tTo the bulk of the human population poverty continues to be a much bigger menace than pollution. The true lesson of the Stockholm Conference is that we must start the quest for a world without poverty and without pollution. We consider that the program should be formulated on a world-wide basis in order to assist countries to meet effectively the requirements of the growth of human settlements and to improve the quality of life in existing settlements by creating a human settlement development fund.\n75.\tThe peaceful uses of the sea-bed and the utilization of \\\" the vast and as yet untapped resources of the sea-bed in the interests of mankind remain a matter of importance to us. We cautiously hope that the preparatory work entrusted to the United Nations Committee on the sea-bed  will result in the early convening of a conference on the law of the sea.\n76.\tRecent developments in the world economy and in the monetary field have caused grave concern to us all and have pointed to the need for the establishing of a more durable and equitable world monetary system. Let us not forget that the world economy will not be restored to health by focusing only on the payments problems of the prosperous countries. Monetary, trade and development problems are all closely interrelated and the developing countries have a vital stake in all of them. The developing countries must therefore participate fully in any decision-making process affecting the future of the international monetary system, so that their legitimate interests may be fully safeguarded.\n77.\tLast week the International Monetary Fund at its annual meeting  showed some awareness of the problem by setting up a committee of Governors in which the developing countries have increased representation. We consider that the link between the special drawing rights and additional development finance, which we have always advocated and the need for which has now been widely realized, should be established soon.\n78.\tIndia participated, with great expectations, in the third session of UNCTAD, held in Santiago earlier this year.\nThe need for taking speedy follow-up action on the decisions taken at that conference cannot be over-emphasized. It may be too early to attempt a final evaluation of the results of the conference, but clearly many trade and allied issues of great concern to the developing countries have remained unresolved. Continued efforts from all sides are therefore necessary if the high hopes that were entertained in respect of that conference are to be realized.\n79.\tTwo years ago my delegation had occasion to emphasize the great importance of the adoption by the General Assembly of an International Development Strategy for the 1970s. It cannot, however, be said with any degree of confidence that the commitments voluntarily assumed by the international community only a short time ago are being implemented with any vigor and vitality. If anything, there has been a slide-back in the fulfillment of the goals and objectives of the Decade, and the interests of the developing countries have been given only residual consideration. During the remaining years of this decade, therefore, it will be necessary for all of us to catch up with the time loss and to evolve effective and concrete pro-grammes of international co-operation in the economic field.\n80.\tAt the same time, the continuous and well-coordinated review and appraisal of the implementation of the Development Strategy will need to be equally emphasized. We hope that the two newly established committees of the Economic and Social Council, the Committee on Review and Appraisal and the Committee on Science and Technology for Development, will be able to make an effective contribution in this field, in close co-ordination with the useful work already being done by UNCTAD and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNIDOJ.\n81.\tOur agenda has nearly a hundred items on it, and I have commented on only a limited number of issues. However, we are conscious that many other problems, whether or not they are included in our agenda, create anxieties and difficulties in many parts of the world. The Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701lAdd.l], has given his views on salient aspects of the international scene as it is today, and on the perspective for the future.\n82.\tIn order to complete my presentation I should like to touch upon the Indian experience over the last year or so.\n83.\tAs I said here 12 months ago [1940th meeting], the year 1971 opened for us with great hopes and yet throughout the year we faced endless, and at times nearly insurmountable, difficulties. Confronted with the most appalling difficulties and human tragedies, the Indian people showed remarkable unity and determination. Within three months of the cease-fire nearly all of the 10 million refugees had gone back to their homes in newly independent Bangladesh. Despite our limited resources we have co-operated fully with Bangladesh in the Herculean task of relief and reconstruction.\n84.\tThe Indian people are now engaged in increasing their agricultural and industrial production. The Government of India has introduced programs in order to achieve greater social justice and more satisfying human values for the Indian people as a whole. In that great experiment the Government and people of India look to the United Nations as a continuous source of inspiration and a vast field of co-operation.\n85.\tYet our Organization is constantly being enfeebled, if not undermined, in a number of ways. Some seek in it partisan support; others make an issue of money and finance; still others try to use it to underwrite their domestic policies. All of these may appear to some to be legitimate, but developing countries such as India look upon this Organization as a bastion where international peace and justice can be protected and where progress can be assured. For that purpose the great principles of the Charter cannot be pursued selectively: they should be taken in their totality, and applied realistically in a given situation. U Thant has already drawn attention to this problem, and we are anxious that in the coming years it should be possible to work out a viable system in which the seeming contradiction in Charter principles would no longer prove to be a hindrance to solving several international problems of our time.\n86.\tSuch a step, taken together with the more massive and co-operative utilization of modern science and technology, may well fulfill the dream for which this Organization was established. There is a need for vigilance and study to decide how we can make our Organization more representative, more effective and more responsive to the multitude of needs of people all over the world.\n87.\tFinally, I would simply say that in spite of many setbacks and disappointments the millions and millions of people of India look to this Organization with faith and hope, and wish that this session of the Assembly may take yet another step, however modest, towards achieving the goal of peace, justice and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Argentine Government, I am pleased to offer you our congratulations on the election as President of the General Assembly of an outstanding son of Poland, a nation with which Argentina enjoys close ties of friendship. We are convinced that your ability and your experience in international problems will ensure success in the deliberations of the Assembly. May I request you to transmit to Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, the appreciation of the Argentine delegation for the brilliant way in which he guided the work of the twenty-sixth session.\n2.\tAt the end of that session, U Thant relinquished his post and we elected a new Secretary-General; at that time the Argentine delegation expressed from the rostrum [2031st meeting] its appreciation to U Thant for his untiring work in the service of our Organization. The efforts made by Mr. Kurt Waldheim in the course of this year strengthen our conviction that his election was well advised and that his talents and ability will contribute effectively to the fulfillment of the goals of the United Nations.\n3.\tThere seems to be no disagreement that the present international system is a multi-polar one, whose various centers of political, economic and socio-cultural power have imposed a dynamism on present-day events that had not been experienced in the post-war years. There can be no doubt that all types of relations among States have become more fluid and articulate and that our Organization has achieved a degree of universality which was unknown during earlier decades. It is also evident that ideological differences have given way to a more pragmatic and realistic approach to problems affecting international life,\n4.\tWe cannot but express our satisfaction that the cold- war stance has been abandoned and that dialog and negotiations have been accepted as a way of achieving peaceful solutions to the controversies among States. Long-divided countries have managed to approach their reunification or have devised procedures permitting more intensive economic, social and cultural relations. All these are also signs of the gradual disappearance of the bipolar system and a relaxation of tensions which have always been encouraged by my country.\n5.\tHowever, the existence of these events must not lead us to lose sight of the need to watch very closely the development of trends within the system itself. Despite the multi-polarity, it is undeniable that the medium and smaller nations remain only marginally involved in the adoption of decisions that affect them directly.\n6.\tIn his introduction to the report on the work of the Organization submitted to the Assembly, the Secretary- General has very rightly pointed out that, \\\"the interests, the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot, at this point in history, be ignored in any durable system of world order\\\" [A/ 8701/Add.l, p. 2]. Pursuant to this line of thought, nothing would be more dangerous than to convert the present multi-polarity into a static system of balance of power. This would spell a new division of the world into spheres of influence by the super-Powers and the larger nations, with the obvious exclusion of a large number of States. The peace and security to which we aspire are not those leading to a rigid situation which would curtail development possibilities, because they could alter the balance achieved. Stability in peace does not mean the freezing of acquired positions, but rather the opening up of new possibilities to ensure a more just and worthy world.\n7.\tIn the decade of the 1970s, the United Nations cannot confine itself to endorsing the acts of the great Powers. It has often been alleged that voting at the United Nations is the performance of a mere ritual. It well may be that this forum has served on numerous occasions to offer the great Powers a way out -a fitting way of saving face at times when, had they continued to follow a selfish or mistaken policy, they might have plunged our world into new and serious conflicts.\n8.\tThis role played by the United Nations should not be disdained. In recent times, however, the membership of the United Nations has altered considerably due to the admission of a majority of countries that either became in-dependent after the Second World War or were not direct contenders in that conflict. Those countries are confronting serious problems of all types and are endeavoring to narrow the gap that separates them from the great Powers as rapidly as possible. Perhaps precisely because of this development lag, their views may differ from those of the great Powers with regard to the analysis of and solutions to their problems and presumably they may consider foreign any approach to them that does not take into account their own needs.\n9.\tAll this leads us to believe that, if the United Nations is to live up to the purposes that dictated its creation, it must assume new functions more in keeping with the present day reality. It is a fact, for example, that the policy of great-Power confrontation has yielded, at least in many cases, to a policy of co-operation; talks have started on fundamental matters; substantive agreements have been arrived at on questions of concern to all. We hope that this attitude of co-operation can be extended to embrace all the countries of the system. But the Organization should also give increasing attention to the problems and the needs of each and every one of its Members. The world of today is an indivisible unit, and the conflicts, problems or situations afflicting one State or one region not only interest, but also affect, all the others.\n10.\tThe Security Council bears an enormous responsibility for the analysis and proposal of solutions to conflicts among States. We do not believe that there are universal prescriptions; we believe that each case must be considered on its own merits, and the onus of implementing measures recommended by the Security Council falls on the parties concerned. While serving as a member of the Security Council, Argentina has maintained a position of strict independence in dealing with the different questions raised and has at all times endeavored to contribute in a constructive way to the solution of the problems examined by that organ.\n11.\tWe attach singular importance to the meetings of the Security Council held in Addis Ababa at the beginning of this year. The positive results obtained proved the wisdom of the initiative taken by the three African members of the Council who proposed that the Council should hold meetings away from Headquarters.\n12.\tLatin America is the natural framework for Argentine foreign policy affairs, and my country has concentrated its efforts within that area. The various visits by the President of Argentina to other countries of South America bespeak clearly the priority attached by my Government to the ties with the sister Republics of the continent. Through these visits and the presidential talks held on Argentine soil, we have established procedures for consultation and co-ordination in order to ensure greater success in our joint efforts to solve our common problems. This policy has led to solid achievements aimed at enhancing our physical, economic, scientific and cultural integration.\n13.\tThe countries of Latin America are not only linked by a common historical tradition, but they are also part of a community of necessary interdependence., We are all protagonists in a process where the fate of each one affects that of the others and where all are called upon to play a major role.\n14.\tWithin the United Nations the Latin American countries have performed and continue to perform a vital function. We have been unswerving defenders of the Charter and of the principles of international law and advocates of peaceful settlement of disputes. We have made common cause with the new nations that have emerged into independent life since 1945 and we have always given support to all measures designed to end colonialism, eliminate racial discrimination and do away with economic differences among peoples. In this way we have been true to the principles that are deeply rooted in the national character of each of our countries, whose populations comprise all races of the world. This is a matter of particular pride and deserves special mention in a parliament that does in fact represent the international community as a whole.\n15.\tWe wish to express our agreement with the comments on the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment made by Mr. Waldheim in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l, p. 5] and with your own words, Mr. President, in your opening statement of this session [2032nd meeting]. The problems of the environment have been a constant concern to my country and that is why, when the item was first discussed in the Economic and Social Council, Argentina was one of the first countries to support the holding of the Stockholm Conference and participated actively in the preparatory work for it.\n16.\tThe most constructive element that emerges from the report of the Conference  is the establishment of international co-operation in the field of the human environment. In accordance with its recommendations and its Declaration, this co-operation is carried out through an exchange of information and collaboration among States. The Conference reflects what experience and practice, science and technology, doctrine and jurisprudence have been teaching us for a long time.\n17.\tIn this field Latin America was ahead of the Stockholm achievements by including in joint declarations of its Presidents and Foreign Ministers the principles which were later approved by the Conference.v\n18.\tIn this, as in any other questions touching the international community, the Argentine Republic upholds the principle of the exercise of sovereignty whereby States perform any acts necessary within their own territory to carry out their national policies. Argentina also maintains that modern States must exercise this sovereignty in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, respecting therefore the same sovereign rights of other States.\n19.\tIn order to achieve a harmonious interplay of this simultaneous exercise of sovereignty on the part of different States, a system of exchange of information is necessary to comply, effectively and appropriately, with the principles of good neighborliness. Without it, international co-operation as advocated by the Stockholm Conference would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.\n20.\tArgentina attaches special significance to the problems relating to the law of the sea. We have participated actively in the work of the sea-bed Committee  and, together with other countries of Latin America, we have upheld the right of the coastal State to extend its sovereignty over the sea adjacent to its shores to a distance of 200 maritime miles and we have reaffirmed its sovereign rights over the continental shelf. This position is based on the provisions of international law and on the imperative need to protect and defend the resources that lie close to our coasts. The Declarations of Montevideo  and Lima and more recently that of Santo Domingo - clearly reflect the responsibility assumed by the majority of the countries of Latin America. Many countries of Africa and Asia that have also had to face the need to adopt measures within the framework of contemporary' international law are joining in this process, to preserve and protect the resources of the sea, the sea-bed and the subsoil of the maritime areas within their jurisdiction and adjacent to their costs.\n21.\tThe task of the future United Nations conference on the law of the sea is to harmonize these rights and interests with those of the international community; its results should bring the benefits of juridical security and justice of a new and more equitable order to this important area of international relations. Therefore, careful study should be given to the preparatory work of the Conference that will be convened, we understand, when the general lines of agreement have been reached and when the enlarged Committee on the sea-bed has fulfilled its mandate. These preparatory efforts and the careful timing of the conference should ensure its positive outcome.\n22.\tThe Argentine Republic continues to follow with increased interest the evolution of events in the Middle East. Our logical concern over the state of affairs prevailing in that region is due to our conviction that international peace is indivisible. For this reason it is imperative that a just and lasting peace be established in that area. We repeat that the strict implementation of the principles and obligations set forth in resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council - to whose adoption the Argentine delegation contributed significantly - is still the basic point of departure to achieve that goal. The conflict has lasted far too long and the different stages that mark its development have left many wounds that are difficult to heal, but they have also taught lessons and given much experience that must not be wasted.\n23.\tTo conclude peace, the highest gifts of statesmanship are required from all.; They must manifest themselves not only in the sincere will to negotiate and to moderate their positions, but also in their sense of timing, which, I would venture to say, is a trait of fundamental importance. The tragedy of opportunities missed haunts peoples for generations and the Argentine Government is ready to continue contributing actively to avoid such a tragedy occurring in the Middle East.\n24.\tThe Argentine Republic has always stated from this rostrum that it totally and unconditionally rejects all types of discrimination and colonialism. For this reason we note with concern that forms of domination still exist that are incompatible with human dignity and with the clear awareness of present day man, who does not accept so-called racial superiorities.\n25.\tIt is a commonplace to state today that colonialism has been overcome. It is a fact that a wide majority of the territories that suffered foreign domination have now acceded to independent life and have taken their place in this Organization. But the unfortunate fact is that a number of colonial situations still exist and it is our duty not to waver for a single moment in our efforts until the last vestige of that unjust and anachronistic dependence has been totally and forever eradicated.\n26.\tNamibia is a typical example, among others. Solely and exclusively to obtain self-determination, and independence for Namibia as soon as possible a step too long postponed-Argentina has proposed legal and political formulas that were given unanimous support by the voting members of the Security Council in February and August of this year [Council resolutions 309 (1972) and 319 (1972)]. We prefer to believe in the evolution of governments, governments that cannot forever turn their backs on the realities surrounding them. Therefore, we still trust that good sense will prevail and that the aspirations of the peoples of Namibia and of the international community, endorsed by a decision of the International Court of Justice,  will be satisfied, and that this will take place immediately in a peaceful and orderly manner.\n27.\tThe unwavering anti-colonialist stand of the Argentine Republic, which I reaffirm now, is not the simple expression of a feeling that we share with the vast majority of nations represented here. In our view, colonialism is not a historical phenomenon whose consequences afflict others nor is it a problem of which we have acquired vicarious knowledge. It is an actual fact that we ourselves are experiencing.\n28.\tAt present, after more than a century and a half of independent life, there still subsists on Argentine soil a residue of that outgrown stage of imperial expansion. It is precisely in order to wipe out that negative vestige of an obsolete past that the Argentine Government is conducting negotiations with the Government of the United Kingdom within the framework of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) in order to find a final solution to the dispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands.\n29.\tIn order to encourage ties between the Malvinas Islands and the mainland and as a result of instruments approved by both countries, efforts have been made which facilitate communications, increase mutual knowledge and benefit the population of the Malvinas. In May of this year, notes were signed and exchanged in Buenos Aires which provided for the construction in the islands, by the Argentine Republic, of an airport which will be capable of dealing with the regular transport of passengers, cargo and mail and which will begin to operate in the next few weeks to replace the amphibious aircraft at present being used.\n30.\tDespite these practical steps of undisputed importance, there still remain differences between the two Governments regarding the circumstances required for a final solution of the question of sovereignty. Further talks on the matter are to be held and we trust that they will be fruitful. The final outcome can be none other than the return of the Malvinas Islands to the Argentine territorial heritage.\n31.\tThe United Kingdom is a country to which we are linked by traditional and cordial ties of friendship and one which has given repeated proof of its clear-sighted approach to the realities of the present day world. We are therefore confident that this case will be no exception. We reiterate that only thus can the obstacle affecting good relations between our two countries be removed for once and for all.\n32.\tThe Argentine Government, which has given proof of reflection and moderation throughout these negotiations in the search for a peaceful solution to the question, hopes that it will not be delayed without justification. We shall thus have fully complied with the terms of paragraph 1 of resolution 2065 (XX), which, furthermore, coincides with the universal desire to put a speedy end to colonial situations all over the world.\n33.\tDisarmament still continues to be one of the most urgent and important questions of the day. During the last two sessions of the General Assembly, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament submitted for our consideration the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, which were subsequently adopted [resolutions 2660 (XXV) and 2826 (XXVI)]. My Government has subscribed to both, since they were instruments that had been the subject of delicate multilateral negotiations in which all parties acted with the greatest care and flexibility in order to arrive at balanced formulas which undoubtedly contribute to the strengthening of international peace and security.\n34.\tWith regard to chemical weapons, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament is not, this year, submitting to the General Assembly an agreed draft convention on weapons of mass destruction of this type, whose dangers are obvious and whose elimination is imperative. We must remember that, because of the relatively low costs of these weapons, they can be developed and produced by many countries. Therefore an agreement on chemical weapons should be acceptable to all States, not only to the great Powers. The negotiations are thus much more complex, since so many views reflecting well-founded concerns must be brought together.\n35.\tThanks to the patient work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, the international community has made some progress in the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Little enough has been achieved, how-ever, in regard to nuclear weapons, apart from some collateral measures of dubious practical effectiveness and, in some ways, of a discriminatory nature.\n36.\tWithin the more restricted framework of bilateral talks on strategic arms, the agreements signed in Moscow are a first step in the right direction; yet these are not measures of nuclear disarmament but efforts to stabilize a precarious military balance between the super-Powers. In other words, they are not enough to stem and turn back the nuclear arms race.\n37.\tIn this discouraging picture of the field of nuclear disarmament, new life must be given to the negotiations, and, in order to do so, the competent organ must ensure the participation of all the nuclear Powers, in a manner satisfactory to all the States concerned. So we note with pleasure that, for the first time in its history, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has given this problem special attention and that its report [A/8818] shows a certain degree of flexibility regarding possible alterations in its organization. My delegation has been particularly interested in this important matter and we venture to hope that this will be the starting-point for informal consultations to rectify an anomaly that is prejudicial to the development of the international community.\n38.\tArgentina has supported the idea that this General Assembly should deal with measures to prevent international terrorism that endangers innocent human lives, costs lives or threatens fundamental freedoms. Elsewhere, and at different times, my country has condemned irrational violence and has appealed for reflection in the face of the wave of hatred and destruction that has swept the world of today. This phenomenon constitutes a serious affront to mankind and to our civilization. Therefore, the United Nations must not and cannot remain indifferent to the danger it implies for peaceful coexistence among men.\n39.\tIn matters of economic co-operation, the international community will have a new and significant opportunity during the rest of 1972 and particularly in 1973 to make progress in the improvement of relations among States of differing degrees of development, through a more just and effective regulation.\n40.\tThe reform of the international monetary system and the planned multilateral trade negotiations are important occasions for those countries that bear the major responsibility to turn their sights beyond their own strictly national interests and allow these new efforts to be fitted into the provisions of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n41.\tWe believe that the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], held in Santiago, Chile, in April and May of this year, constituted a promising point of departure for that international undertaking. During the course of that session the convergence of the policies for co-operation in that field reached new heights.\n42.\tBoth at that session of UNCTAD and at other international and regional meetings on economic and financial matters, Argentina has pledged its determined support so that such initiatives will achieve the success that the international community is eagerly seeking.\n43.\tIn the fields of science and technology, Argentina is determined to make rapid advances in a dynamic process of modernization through the maximum use of the resources offered by these branches of knowledge in order to secure better standards of living for its population.\n44.\tWe are disturbed over the prevalence of certain views in the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] which, ignoring the multiplying effect of the efforts of co-operation made by peoples at different stages of development, are trying to change the present system of distribution of resources, reserving them almost exclusively for extreme cases of optimum development.\n45.\tAt the same time as Argentina makes use of UNDP as a helpful instrument to complement its needs in that area, we must stress that we also contribute a considerable number of national experts who service projects in different parts of the world and that we welcome yearly more than a hundred fellowship holders from other countries for training in our country.\n46.\tAt the beginning I pointed out the dangers for the medium and small nations of being left on the fringes of a multi-polar system based on the balance of power among the great Powers. We are also disturbed over any attempts to slow down the process of updating the economies of the developing countries by limiting the transfer of science and technology to them.\n47.\tTo concede that growth must be stemmed would be tantamount to admitting that there are countries doomed to remain halfway on the road to civilization and would further imply a frustration of man's capacity for permanent creation. As was the case in economic matters, in the fields of culture and the preservation of the environment, here too active international co-operation is imperative.\n48.\tIf we wish to achieve international peace and security, which are fundamental objectives of our Charter, then we shall have to make real the aspirations to a better life for which all peoples yearn. There can be no peace without international justice, and there will be no justice until each and every country assumes fully its responsibilities. In 1945 our Organization was born to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Man's survival is still paramount today, but there is a clear awareness that it must rest on the firm foundations of freedom and the dignity of the human person so that he can develop to the utmost his creative potential. These drives, which are the features of our day and our society, must be reflected in the action of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is my privilege to join all my colleagues in extending heartiest congratulations to you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current, twenty-seventh session. Your high qualities of statesmanship will be of great value as you steer the work of this session to the successful conclusion to which all Member States aspire.\n2.\tI should like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, since his assumption of this key position, has worked tirelessly, with selfless dedication, towards fulfilling the resolutions and recommendations of this august body.\n3.\tThere are many people who believe that the United Nations is ineffectual in matters pertaining to the ultimate issues of human welfare. For this reason proposals are being made for amending the Charter. But it is often overlooked that it is the Member States that lay down and implement policies, and not an abstract body called the United Nations. This must be stated clearly and forcefully if the United Nations is to live up to the challenge which animated its founders more than a quarter of a century ago. They intended to ensure a supranational structure dedicated to peace with justice and to the unity of mankind.\n4.\tThere must be something wrong somewhere when the overwhelming will of this all-embracing body is flouted with impunity, as is the case in the Middle East.Peace and justice are indivisible, and the rule of law, whether in national or in international affairs, is likewise indivisible. This is the essence of collective responsibility, as well as the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\n5.\tIf my words reflect misgivings, it is not my intention to sound a counsel of despair. Both under the United Nations and independently of it, there is emerging in the world community a spirit of detente, which my delegation wholeheartedly applauds. Many areas which, over the past quarter-century, have been hotbeds of potential confrontation nave been turned into areas of accommodation, or at least of peaceful coexistence. My delegation expresses the hope that all States and all nations will join the trend towards abandonment of war as an instrument of policy.\n6.\tOne of the issues raised during the current session of the General Assembly is the item on international terrorism [item 92]. Jordan is opposed to violence, whatever its source or methods. Jordan is ready to participate effectively in any international measures to protect innocent civilians against violence. At the same time Jordan and, I am sure, all peoples of the world support the right of an occupied people-every occupied people effectively to resist occupation and colonialism.\n7.\tAs I speak on behalf of Jordan and against a back-ground of the problems which my country has been compelled to endure in consequence of the 1967 war, my remarks on the role of the United Nations in resolving conflicts assume a stark and deadly reality. And let me declare in the strongest terms that, with only the tragic exception of Indochina, the Middle East remains the only area outside the pale of justice, peace and security. In Jordan human beings like you, gentlemen, are daily faced with tribulations violating every principle, concept or ideal to which the United Nations addresses itself. My address, therefore, to this distinguished gathering is far from being an academic exercise and, still less, a sermon on the virtues of virtuous behavior.\n8.\tWhat are the basic ingredients in the situation which is commonly referred to as the Middle East crisis? I fully realize that the case has been stated and restated very often, year in and year out; and yet it must be restated, if only because no progress whatsoever has been achieved towards its just and peaceful solution. On the contrary, the passage of years is compounding an already desperate situation and making it intolerable. The basic facts of the case, as of today, are as follows.\n9.\tFirst, as a result of the 1967 war in the Middle East, nearly half of the citizens of Jordan have been, for more than five years, suffering the bondage and enslavement of Israeli occupation. A similar fate has befallen substantial parts of the territories of Egypt and Syria. Occupation, like slavery, is a curse, regardless of its nature or duration; it is doubly so when the victims are a whole population and when deliverance seems to be receding into an unknown abyss.\n10.\tTo us the issues at stake are fundamental: they are nothing less than a mortal threat to the very survival of\u2003Jordan as a State and as a people. Israel makes no pretense about its determination to swallow up at least those substantial parts of Jordan which it already occupies. Peace, to the Israelis, seems no longer anything but an empty expression which is conveniently used in forums such as the United Nations a use of language to conceal the aim.\n11.\tExperience tells us that the people under Israeli occupation are not looked upon as a community of human beings with a birthright expectation of continuity in their homeland; rather, they are looked upon as things or obstacles, to be removed at the appropriate moment of Israel's choosing; hence the urgency of collective world action to bring about the speediest termination of occupation and the salvation of the multitudes in Israel's bondage.\n12.\tSecond, the traumatic consequences of the events of 1948, which resulted in the physical dispersal of well over 1 million Palestinian refugees, have been increased by the events of 1967 a repeat of those of 1948. An additional half a million victims were added to the ranks of the uprooted. They are referred to as \\\"displaced persons\\\" to differentiate them from their own compatriots, the 1948 refugees. But even this differentiation is becoming blurred as occupation continues unchecked. The United Nations resolutions pertaining to the immediate repatriation of the displaced population are being added to the stockpile of United Nations resolutions which Israel consistently ignores.\n13.\tThird, the United Nations and its Member States have, since 1967, made every effort to bring about a peaceful and just solution to the conflict. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967); its points were clear, its intent specific. It reaffirmed the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories. It provided guarantees for a just and lasting peace. Both Jordan and Egypt accepted that resolution and all the obligations devolving upon them under its terms. Not only did they express their acceptance by every possible means and on every conceivable occasion but they also registered their unqualified acceptance in writing. That was done in the course of replying to specific questions put by the most able and dedicated Ambassador Jarring in the spring of 1969.\n14.\tThe Israeli response to Mr. Jarring's earnest mission was not only negative but also misleading and hostile. Israel continues to give such a response to this very day. The Israelis, in effect, have opted for territorial expansion in preference to the long-cherished goal of a just and lasting peace.\n15.\tThe United Nations and the world at large are fully justified in asking, why is it that peace seems so remote and elusive in the Middle East? What stands in the way of a solution of the problem which has kept the world on edge for almost 25 years?\n16.\tWe are convinced that there will be no solution to the Palestine problem until the problem of Israel is solved. What is the Israeli problem? Simply stated, here is a country created by this very body, the United Nations, when its membership still consisted of only a minority of mankind. From the date of its birth in the heart of Palestine, over the protest of the Palestinian people themselves and their Arab neighbors and brethren, Israel has been the center of never-ending conflict. Although a creation of the United Nations, Israel's outspoken defiance of this body and of its resolutions has weakened the power of the United Nations to the point of impotency.\n17.\tVeterans of debates in this Assembly recall only too well the hope for peace that followed the truce of 1948; they recall only too well the subsequent resolution that guaranteed to Palestinians who had been driven from their homes the right to return to them or to be compensated for their losses [resolution 194 (III)]. Never did this body feel surer of its wisdom or more confident of its power: within months peace would return to the Middle East.\n18.\tBut that was the day that the power of the United Nations was first challenged and began to crumble. That was the day that Israel first defied the United Nations. Israel refused to allow one uprooted Palestinian to return to his home and refused to pay one penny of his losses. And for 25 years hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have lived in exile.\n19.\tToday, of course-except when the budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is passed-we have forgotten all about these refugees. Today our concern is with Israel's defiance of another resolution, the Security Council resolution of November 1967. Called on to withdraw from the Arab territories seized during the June war in return for a lasting peace, Israel has simply refused. Confident that its defiance will meet with no more than mild rebukes, it continues to occupy Arab land, and challenges the United Nations and the Arabs to do anything about it. So I submit that we must bring the Israel question before the General Assembly.\n20.\tWhat is to become of Israel? Is it to go on from conquest to conquest, fulfilling at last the Zionist dream of a land extending from the Nile to the Euphrates? Despite Israel's past successes, this hardly seems a realizable goal while all the world is watching. Yet in the mind of many a Zionist zealot this is the only way to in-gather the 12 million Jews from all over the world. Or will Israel content itself with holding on firmly to the Arab lands it already has: Sinai; the west bank of the Jordan, including Jerusalem; and the Syrian Golan heights? Five years have passed since those lands were occupied, and nothing on the horizon indicates Israel's intention to do anything else but to continue to occupy them.\n21.\tObviously, either the expansion or continuation of Israel's present course will lead to perpetual conflict. The former, I imagine, would bring others into the conflict. The latter and this is much more likely to happen would be the war into which both sides seem regrettably to be drafting. If such a war were fought, it would be to the end. It would lead to the devastation of the whole area.\n22.\tFor the moment Israel has rejected the right choice: the one offered in the 1967 resolution. It may well be that it will continue to reject it, year after year, as the years pass. The mentality of Israel's present leadership should change to one less conditioned by fixed dogma and prejudice, one which will agree with the rest of the world that in the 1967 resolution lies the one best hope for a political settlement. It came as no surprise at all that the Israeli Foreign Minister, in his misleading speech before the Assembly at its 2045th meeting, chose to ignore the resolution altogether in a calculated affront to those who adopted it.\n23.\tThere are innumerable issues which can be intelligently explained only within the context of Israeli ideology and practices. First, there are the undisguised declarations of intent permanently to annex occupied territories of three Member States under the flimsy pretext of security. Does security, in the dwarfed spaces of the modern age, depend on a hilltop here or a little town there? Then, there are the attacks against the adjacent Arab countries, resulting in considerable loss of life and property, mainly amongst innocent civilians. We might add the negative attitude of Israel towards each and every attempt to resolve the conflict in accordance with the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 and the scores of other related resolutions. Then there are the flagrant violations of the Geneva Conventions governing the\\\" rights of civilian inhabitants under occupation; the wanton destruction of villages and towns; and, last but not least, the dispersal of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants from the territories which fell victim to occupation.\n24.\tNo discussion of the crisis in the Middle East would be meaningful without emphasis in the strongest terms on the fate and future of Jerusalem, a city hallowed by hundreds of millions of believers-Moslems, Christians and Jews-all over the world. The Israeli claims to an exclusive hold on that great historic city and the systematic efforts since the occupation to transform its unique identity are not only a violation of its sanctity, but also a deep wound inflicted upon the conscience of humanity.\n25.\tIt was in recognition of this fact that both the General Assembly and the Security Council adopted specific resolutions for the preservation of Jerusalem. These were in addition to the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967, which provided for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories, including the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem.\n26.\tThe Israelis describe their annexation as unification, ignoring the fact that there can be no unification in bondage, where one community tramples upon the soul, the human dignity, the land and the accumulated culture of other communities.\n27.\tAs we declare that we hold on to our rights in Jerusalem, let me emphasize in the name of Jordan and of all peoples of goodwill that believe in the unique sanctity of Jerusalem, that it will always remain the key to a just and lasting solution in the Middle East.\n28.\tOne of the most crucial developments that stemmed from the June war of 1967 has been an awareness throughout the world of the magnitude of the injustice that has befallen the people of Palestine. The people of Jordan and Palestine are one and the same. The people on both banks of the Jordan have shared a common national life over the past quarter-century. The aspirations of the Palestinian people to restore their national identity, which was brutally shattered in 1948, has inspired Jordan to seek ways and means of promoting the constructive expression of a Palestinian identity without destroying the basic unity that binds the east and west banks together. It is sometimes overlooked that almost every family on the west bank of the Jordan has sons, daughters, mothers and in-laws on the east bank, and vice versa.\n29.\tThe Israeli occupation of the west bank has resulted in one of the most massive and shattering cases of family separation that history has ever known. The temporary visits to the next-of-kin on the occupied west bank, to which the Israeli Foreign Minister gave a distorted meaning, merely serve to highlight the magnitude of this human tragedy.\n30.\tInspired by the imperative need to preserve the basic unity of our country without forfeiting the regional identities of the two components of the Kingdom, Jordan has put forward a plan for the creation of a federal State the United Arab Kingdom.\n31.\tThe United Arab Kingdom would comprise two autonomous regions: the Jordanian and the Palestinian. The Palestinian region within the federation would be open as a homeland to every Palestinian wherever he might be. He would then be a citizen as of right and not on sufferance. It is an effort towards the gathering in of the Palestinian people after their inhuman Diaspora. It would be open to unity with any Palestinian territory so choosing. Its capital would naturally be Arab Jerusalem.\n32.\tThe plan would not only ensure the gathering of the Palestinians into a territory which is theirs but would also maintain the essential link of that Palestinian identity with the rest of the Arab world, of which the Palestinians are an integral part, through its association with the eastern part of the Kingdom.\n33.\tI should like to stress that the plan would become feasible and capable of implementation only after the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied Arab lands. What stands in its way? It is the problem of Israel.\n34.\tIsrael has more than once achieved its military objectives in its conflicts with the Arabs, but not once has it succeeded in achieving the fruits of its successes, or peace. All wars and struggles, no matter how intense or brutal, end in peace. The war which Zionism has waged and continues to wage against the Arab nation is an exception. The reason is what I have called the Israeli problem.\n35.\tLet Israel free itself of the militaristic obsession. Let it free itself of Zionist euphoria and genuinely reach for peace.\n36.\tAlready there are internal rumblings that will grow louder in the coming years if only given a proper and just chance. Among those rumblings are: the present openly expressed realization among Israelis that an injustice has been done to Palestinians; strikes and demonstrations against racial discrimination; the steady increase in the emigration of skilled western Israelis back to western countries; the restlessness caused by the second-class status of eastern-born Jews as compared with European-born Israelis; the growing fear that with no new crisis Western dollars will no longer flow in such a steady stream.\n37.\tThese and other signs of inner discontent are troubling the Israeli leadership. But they are giving encouragement to the rest of the world or at least to part of it that a new world can emerge in the Middle East.\n38.\tIn the struggle to reach such a new world in the Middle East Jordan intends to play no small or insignificant role. It has set its course for a vigorous march to a happy and prosperous future. With wise and courageous leadership, the good will of its people and the support of its friends everywhere, Jordan intends to contribute its share to the future of this world.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, geographically and historically, the relations between Poland and Sweden have been close throughout the centuries. I therefore take particular pleasure in conveying to you our sincere congratulations upon your election to your high office.\n61.\tMr. Secretary-General, we have already had the opportunity to express our sincere felicitations to you during your recent visit to our country. Today I wish to state once again that you can rely upon the unfailing support of the Swedish Government in your devoted and tireless efforts in the cause of world peace.\n62.\t\\\"To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\"-this very opening line of the Charter expresses our principal commitment as Members of the United Nations. To prevent, to restrain and to confine the use of military foL 3 remain the prime objectives of the United Nations.\n63.\tWar is unacceptable as a means of settling international disputes. This must apply also to the conflict in Viet-Nam. The United States has employed its immense economic and military resources to escalate the use of force to unprecedented levels. Immense sufferings are being inflicted upon the people of Viet-Nam. The physical environment of the country is being devastated. And this morning has brought a dramatic confirmation of the indiscriminate bombing of central Hanoi. The French diplomatic mission has been hit, and members of its staff have been killed or wounded.\n64.\tThis war must be brought to an end. A political solution of the Viet-Nam conflict must be found. The VietNamese must at least be given the possibility to decide their own future without interference from outside. As for South Viet-Nam, a reasonable solution would seem to be the formation of a coalition government, coupled with the provision of guarantees against oppression of any party by another. All over the world people are impatiently expecting the parties to the current talks to agree on a peaceful solution.\n65.\tThe conflict in Viet-Nam is a drastic reminder of the human sufferings that are caused by war, particularly to civilians. Many of the international rules in this field date back to the Hague Conventions of 1907, which are now out of date in important respects. Modern science and technology have made available increasingly cruel weapons and means of warfare. We have now reached a state where technologically advanced Powers can from a safe distance wage large-scale war on man and his environment even without the use of nuclear weapons.\n66.\tThe United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have during the last few years been engaged in supplementing existing rules against inhuman warfare by new ones covering modern weapons and means of warfare. My Government regards this work as vitally important.\n67.\tIn our opinion, the need for rules restricting air warfare is particularly pressing. The Second World War saw the introduction of the mass bombing of cities. Area bombing has been carried out during the war in Viet-Nam. These acts of war are legally questionable, of doubtful military value and have terrible effects on the civilian population.\n68.\tAll use of weapons and methods of warfare causing unnecessary suffering must be subjected to international prohibition. A beginning was made with the 1925 Geneva Protocol covering chemical and bacteriological warfare.  In 1969, the General Assembly affirmed the comprehensive nature of that Protocol [resolution 2603 (XXIV)]. Consequently, the Protocol also bans the use of tear gas and herbicides. We must urge unreserved respect for this prohibition by all States. We must go even further. Dumdum bullets were forbidden at the turn of the century because they caused unnecessary suffering. Now, by means of international conventions, we must impose a similar ban on a number of modern weapons which are particularly cruel. The report on napalm and other incendiary weapons,  soon to be presented to us by the Secretary- General, will no doubt provide us with a valuable basis for discussions on such a ban. Increased knowledge of the effects of modern weaponry should also serve to alert public opinion to the necessity of decisive international action in this field.\n69.\tIt is deplorable that the international community should today have to concern itself with modernizing the laws of war. We should all have preferred to concentrate on rules for the peaceful and harmonious coexistence of all peoples. Nevertheless, we must tackle the task of limiting, by way of mandatory and precise rules, the suffering and devastation brought about by war. World-wide popular support should be mobilized to that end.\n70.\tSome of the problems I have mentioned fall within the purview of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. As for others, we shall have to consider further which bodies are the most appropriate to tackle them.\n71.\tUnder all circumstances, disarmament efforts within the framework of the United Nations must be continued energetically and must concentrate on particularly urgent issues, where it seems realistic to hope for results in the foreseeable future. A total ban on nuclear weapons tests and such tests are still being carried out undiminished in number and in strength appears to offer such hopes. The objections raised concerning the verification of underground nuclear testing are no longer valid.\n72.\tIt is a matter of concern that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] has not yet attracted sufficient support. The readiness of the non-nuclear States to accede to the Treaty is, of course, related to the willingness of the nuclear Powers, for their part, to contribute to armaments control and disarmament. From this point of view the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms is a step in the right direction, although this is not disarmament in the real sense of the word. We must now hope for further binding agreements in the disarmament field between the super-Powers.\n73.\tHowever, all nuclear Powers must take an active part in future disarmament efforts. An opportunity for such participation would be offered by a world disarmament conference. Such a conference, in which all States should participate, could also give new impetus to continued efforts in the sphere of disarmament in general.\n74.\tLast year's decision on China's representation in the United Nations [resolution 2758 (XXVI)] was an important step towards that universality which should be the goal of our Organization. The question of the representation of divided States presents us with specific problems which are not necessarily identical from case to case. Where reunification seems remote, the participation of such States in the work of the United Nations becomes particularly essential. The process of detente in Europe gives rise to hopes that the two German States will soon be able to join the United Nations. Both can make valuable contributions to our work.\n75.\tThe question of Korea's representation can be seen in a similar light. Korea has been a special concern of the United Nations ever since the early days of the world Organization. Divergent views on responsibility for the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950 should no longer prevent us from considering dispassionately the Korean problem and the role that the United Nations can and should play in this matter. We welcome the efforts of the North and South Korean Governments to improve neighborly relations. The international community has every reason to follow closely the development of relations between the two Korean States. If those two States were more widely recognized by other States this would probably contribute to detente and peace in that part of the world.\n76.\tIn the Middle East, pressure from the international community is essential if peace and detente are to be achieved. The fact that a cease-fire has, by and large, been effective for more than two years is of course gratifying. This circumstance must not, however, become a reason for our relaxing our efforts to reach a solution based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The Swedish Government reiterates its support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in their endeavors to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n77.\tThe detente in Europe was greeted with great satisfaction by many speakers here last year. In this year's general debate we are able to register further progress in this respect. Strong forces are at work for a normalization of relations between the European States. But it is not enough to normalize and stabilize the situation. Determined efforts are needed to achieve a fruitful exchange and co-operation among all States in Europe. It is our hope that a conference on security and co-operation in Europe will contribute significantly to this development.\n78.\tThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is our common guideline in the efforts to secure, in the words of the Declaration, \\\"the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\\\" [resolution 217(111)]. For centuries the struggle for human rights has played a particularly important role in Europe. This struggle has known both victories and defeats, and such rights have rarely been extended to peoples in other continents living under the supremacy of European Powers.\n79.\tThe struggle for human rights in Europe has registered serious set-backs in recent years. This applies in particular to developments in Greece and Czechoslovakia. In spite of repeated assurances, the Greek Government has failed to embark upon the road back to democracy. In Czechoslovakia the proponents of the ideas of 1968 have been subjected to increased pressure.\n80.\tThe difficulties involved in finding methods to safeguard respect for human rights are well known. The Swedish Government welcomes the fact that since 1970 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has been authorized to receive and analyze individual complaints regarding violations of human rights. In this way a possibility has been created within the United Nations to focus attention on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We consider that the results of these studies should also be made public. Within international organizations we will continue to press for more effective measures to safeguard human rights, regardless of national frontiers. A vigilant international public opinion is an important contribution to the protection of those rights.\n81.\tWhere there is suppression of human rights, there is usually also a tendency to resort to violence in internal conflicts. To condone violence in such conflicts could undermine the inhibitions against the use of force also in relations between States. There may be cases where the inclination of a regime to suppress by violent means every form of opposition sparks desperate acts of violence from those oppressed. In order to find long-term solutions to these problems we have to identify and eliminate the underlying causes of violence. In many cases these causes may be intolerable injustices.\n82.\tThe urgency of solving these long-range problems does not absolve us from the responsibility of tackling the acute problems, which certain forms of international terrorism confront us with. Whatever the motive, the international community cannot possibly tolerate such actions as the hijacking of aircraft, the taking of hostages, or the murder of persons engaged in peaceful activities outside their own countries. My Government welcomed the Secretary- General's proposal for the inclusion of such problems on our agenda fA/8791 and Add.l], and the Swedish delegation will co-operate in efforts to take efficient international measures against these forms of violence. This does not, however, absolve individual Member States from taking adequate measures to the same end.\n83.\tWhile tackling the problem of how to fight international terrorism, we must not fail to react when individual Governments gravely encroach upon the rights of human beings on account of their ethnic origin. When whole communities in a country are subjected to violence on such grounds, public opinion in other countries naturally reacts with particular vigor. When a Government forces an ethnic minority into exile, it not only commits an offense against basic principles of human coexistence but also adds further to the world's increasingly difficult and tragic refugee problems. To observe silence in the face of such events would compromise the credibility of the struggle against racial oppression-one of the major commitments of the United Nations.\n84.\tThe systematic oppression which has been instituted and consolidated in southern Africa occupies a position of its own in the history of conflicts between races and peoples. There must be no weakening of international pressure against the apartheid regime of South Africa and its allies. Apartheid differs from other forms of oppression in that the system rests on an ideological basis of naked contempt for races other than the white. It consolidates an order where the prosperity of the white minority is derived from the poverty of the non-white majority. The policy of apartheid is far more deliberate, systematic and consistent that the manifestations of racial discrimination found in other parts of the world. By its very essence apartheid constitutes a challenge to the international community.\n85.\tIt cannot be accepted that apartheid should prevail also in Namibia. The Swedish Government welcomes the Secretary-General's recent actions with regard to this problem. We support all efforts to further real self-determination and independence for Namibia.\n86.\tWith deep concern we see the ideas of apartheid gaining ground among the white minority in Rhodesia. This minority openly defies the repeated decisions of the Security Council and aims at wearing down world resistance to its illegal regime. Effective sanctions against the Smith regime are still imperative. Every evasion of the sanctions must be condemned.\n87.\tPortugal bears a special responsibility in this context, as it obviously allows its colonies to serve as a channel for illegal trade with Rhodesia. At the same time the Portuguese Government persists in its colonial policies, which have repeatedly been condemned by an overwhelming majority of the Member States of the United Nations. These policies are in open conflict with fundamental principles of the United Nations. Humanitarian assistance to the liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) in accordance with United Nations resolutions can be taken as a manifestation of the donor countries' opposition to the policy of oppression,\n88.\tThe United Nations has so far been unable to eliminate racial oppression in southern Africa. All the same, we must not underestimate the importance of the fact that through the United Nations world attention has been focused on this tragic problem.\n89.\tToday the United Nations plays an important role in international development co-operation. My Government wishes to see this role increase in importance, because in the United Nations more than anywhere else this cooperation is based on respect for the right of all States to form their own destinies.\n90.\tThe normative function of the United Nations, which is central to its work, is manifested in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. One of the basic objectives of the Strategy is to ensure that progress in a developing country works to the benefit of all its citizens.\nThis objective has important implications for the policies of both poor and rich countries. It calls for far-reaching reforms of the social structure in many developing countries, as well as for greater economic independence. Demands for changes in the economic relations between rich and poor countries are an expression of this struggle for independence. The rich countries must respond in a positive manner to these demands. The primary and immediate responsibility of all developed countries is to fulfill their commitments concerning development assistance made in the Strategy for the Second Development Decade. The Swedish Government remains committed to the pledges made when the International Development Strategy was adopted. We note with regret that a number of industrialized countries are tending to cut back on their total development assistance.\n91.\tThe increasingly important role of development cooperation in the work of the United Nations is a reflection of the great changes which have taken place in the world since our Organization came into being. To a far greater extent than anyone could foresee when the Organization was created, the United Nations has become an indispensable instrument for overcoming those tensions inside and between nations which might be provoked by technological progress and industrial development.\n92.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June, focused our attention on problems which are of vital concern for both rich and poor nations. As the host country for the Conference, we noted with satisfaction the wide participation of States Members of the United Nations in the Conference, but regret that political disagreement prevented a truly universal representation. It is our hope that the Assembly as a whole will endorse the results of the Stockholm Conference, which can be considered as the first important step towards continuous and permanent co-operation within the whole United Nations family on problems of the human environment. My Government pledges its support for the establishment of a Governing Council for Environmental Programs, for an environment secretariat and for an environment fund. We in the rich countries who contribute so much to pollution have a special responsibility to pursue the work that has just started. However, more and more Governments in developing countries are anxious to integrate active environment policies into their programs for economic and social development. We are convinced that a general positive attitude will manifest itself as this Assembly now takes the next step towards an international environment policy. Our collective will to contribute to a better environment is a prerequisite for our being able to hand over to coming generations a world where life is possible and where life is worth living.\n93.\tThe deterioration of the human environment inevitably raises questions concerning the amount of available resources on our earth and of their distribution. These questions have a vital influence on international relations. They can find a just solution only through co-operation between States on an equal footing. This applies, for example, to the problems how the resources of the oceans and the sea-bed recognized by the United Nations as the common heritage of mankind should be exploited for the benefit of all peoples, and how the results of the \\\"green revolution\\\" can best be utilized to serve the masses of people in the developing countries.\n94.\tIn view of the immense problems confronting mankind it is natural to attach increasing importance to the United Nations. This is true not least for the problem of how the world's population growth can be regulated. A penetrating analysis of the population problems can be expected at the forthcoming United Nations World Population Conference. It is to be hoped that all Member States will make constructive contributions to that conference.\n95.\tI have stated the views of my Government on some specific-but often interrelated-questions which are of special relevance for the international community at this time. Organized international co-operation for the maintenance of peace, of which the United Nations is the supreme manifestation, has aimed primarily at preventing changes of existing frontiers and treaty obligations by violent means. As a result, the preservation of status quo has often been regarded as the cardinal task of a policy for peace. But that cannot be the ultimate goal. The status quo alone cannot constitute the basis for a lasting peace. We must recognize at an early stage those tensions which necessitate change. We must continue to work for peaceful change in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. That is the only way in which we can proceed towards a world of greater equality and stability.\n96.\tWe all have a responsibility for the future of mankind. Our national and regional problems cannot be isolated from our common and global problems. The search for solutions must be a joint effort of all the peoples of the world. The hopes of mankind for a brighter future remain centered on the United Nations. The United Nations must not betray these hopes.\n"

        "file_text": "Since the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, the international political situation has been marked by new and decisive facts in relations between certain Powers.\n188.\tDespite the easing of tension which is being brought about between what is conventionally termed the East and West, despite the contacts which have occurred between the United States and the People's Republic of China on the one hand, and between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the other hand, despite the tremendously encouraging admission on the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, the world still remains in a state of tension, with trouble spots and injustices which are arbitrarily suffered by those people who are still oppressed and subjected in the middle of the twentieth century.\n189.\tImperialism, in effect, although it is at bay, is not giving up so easily. Its aggressions are continuing, both in Africa and Asia, as well as in Latin America, and its constant threats are still leveled against young States.\n190.\tI should like once again to draw the attention of our international Organization to the permanent state of war in which my country is living. From July 1961 to October 1970 we were alerting international public opinion to the fact that war is being prepared against our State. This war was prefaced by repeated violations of our air space and bombings of the villages bordering on Guinea (Bissau). The aggression of 22 November 1970 against our country has shown how right we were in thus alerting international public opinion.\n191.\tThis state of affairs is recurring even now, despite the fact that the Security Council condemned Portugal after that barbarous aggression which was perpetrated in Conakry, at Gaoual and Koundara, against the Republic of Guinea.\n192.\tIn recent months, we have witnessed repeated incursions on the part of the Portuguese pirate planes which continue to violate our air space, for the most part hurling rocket bombs on our villages, sowing death and destruction and destroying the harvest of peaceful farmers. By way of example I should like to quote some other cases to illustrate the threats which are hanging over our people, threats which might turn into genuine aggression: on 27 November 1971 at 1230 four bombers dropped eight rockets on Katila, setting fire to the village and leaving three dead and several wounded; on 9 December 1971, a reconnaissance plane flew over the villages of Lela and of Sinta for 35 minutes; on 20 January 1972 at 1555 there was a reconnaissance flight over the village of Bakilouto in the administrative region of Boke; on 20 February 1972 at 1225 a reconnaissance plane was shot down in Pakaye; the next day at 1125 in the same village one of two bombers was shot down, both of these bombers being of the same type, FIAT; on 23 February 1972 at 1045 and on 18 March 1972 at 0930 two planes, one reconnaissance plane and one transport, flew over the villages of Negare and of Bundu-Furdu; on 22 April 1972 at 1600 an unidentified plane flew over the village of Guingan; on 24 April 1972 from 1052 to 1125, the villages of Kandika-Kutan, of Sutumuru and of Missira were flown over by two bombers and on the same date at 1125 at Kaurane, two other bombers attempted in vain to attack a reservoir; on 2 May 1972 at 1200, three bombers of the FIAT type attempted to attack the village of Sutumuru; on 14 July 1972 at 1425, two FIAT bombers bombed Pakaye and set fire to the Pirada station and one plane was shot down leaving two of the enemy crew dead; on 8 August 1972 at 1435 a heavy bomber attacked the villages of Pakaye and Missira, was pursued, hit and shot down in the forest of the village of Kode-Sane between Pirada and St. Hoggu.\n193.\tThese multiple attacks against the sovereignty of the Republic of Guinea surely demonstrate that imperialism is pursuing fresh aggressive maneuvers against our people.\n194.\tWe have been informed of the fact that in Guinea (Bissau) the training of mercenaries has been started again, for the purpose of reconquering the Republic of Guinea. In a few months the world should not be surprised to learn that forces made up of countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and South Africa are attacking our people. But we give you due notice that these future mercenaries will meet their end in the Republic of Guinea.\n195.\tThose few facts must impress each and every one of us. If colonialist Portugal is pursuing a deliberate policy of provocation, to the point of bombing African States neighbouring on Territories which it occupies illegally, and is indulging in acts of piracy and banditry in deliberate violation of international morality, it is because behind them stand powerful allies which represent, as we see it, those who are truly responsible for maintaining foreign domination in Africa.\n196.\tIt is NATO, again, which makes it possible for the apartheid regime of South Africa to survive and to consolidate It\\\" system of racial segregation in southern Africa in defiance of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It goes without* saying that the people of South Africa, the victim of this brutal oppression, will not be able to contain its legitimate aspiration to freedom and resign itself to living in Bantustans which are nothing more than ghettos for the black man, stripped of all his elementary\n.rights. Despite the considerable assistance which the NATO Powers are giving to South Africa to make it into a military Power pitted against the independent States of Africa, no Power in the world will prevent the people of South Africa from some day in the near future being the absolute masters of this area which is so rich and prosperous and which is now being arbitrarily exploited by the Boers.\n197.\tThe Government of the Republic of Guinea, its Party and its militant people urge the South African nationalists to destroy the Vorster clique by force of arms and by united revolutionary action. We have no doubt that such action will be pursued victoriously under the banner of the Pan-Africanist Congress and the African National Congress in order to restore to our militant brothers their inalienable rights.\n198.\tSouth Africa, whose mandate over Namibia has been revoked by decisions taken respectively by the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations, must forthwith withdraw from this Territory.\n199.\tThe strike movements initiated by Namibian workers at the beginning of this year are incontestable proof that the South West Africa People's Organization has undertaken and is skilfully conducting the struggle for liberation throughout Namibian territory. Furthermore, pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Security Council in Addis Ababa, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, will next November make a complete report to the Security Council on his mission. Whatever happens the prospects for the\nindependence of this people can no longer be in question, although it is true that South Africa is desperately clinging to this Territory, over which it has already forfeited political and administrative control.\n200.\tWhite minority regimes have no place in southern Africa. The failure of the Pearce Commission has demonstrated to the world the shaky foundations of the rebel regime in Salisbury. The popular and spontaneous uprising of the Zimbabwe people is undeniable proof of the fact that this people has become aware of the Anglo-Rhodesian maneuvers. The United Kingdom, which is in fact the administering Power in Rhodesia, can no longer shirk its responsibility to lead this colony to independence. The group of businessmen for whom Ian Smith is a mere spokesman will of necessity have to bow to the rule of the majority which the Zimbabwe nationalists will soon make prevail under the auspices of the OAU, which at this very moment is working for unity of action on the part of all the political parties in the struggle for Zimbabwe.\n201.\tHowever, the United Kingdom will have to shoulder its responsibilities fully, by immediately convening a constitutional conference of all parties to the dispute. Prior to this they should free all political prisoners, particularly Joshua Nkomo, the Reverend Sithole and others. In this connexion the vetoes cast by the United Kingdom at Addis Ababa on 4 February 1972 and in New York on 29 September 1972 will not fail to arouse in all the peoples in Africa that love peace and justice a feeling of abhorrence and indignation against the Government of the United Kingdom. Thus, in less than a year the United Kingdom has twice demonstrated its opposition to the Zimbabwe people's exercising its right to self-determination and independence.\n202.\tAfrica, which still remains the only continent where colonialism is rife, has mobilized all its human and material resources to free its peoples. Did not the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Rabat in June, double the volume of assistance given to the African liberation movements to expedite and streamline their struggle? The persistence of colonialism has made all the States of Africa fully aware of the situation; their independence will not be fully effective until all the pockets of colonial resistance in the African continent have been destroyed. The Portuguese colonies are now inflicting on economically undeveloped Portugal military reverses which undoubtedly will lead shortly to their national independence.\t\n203.\tIn Guinea (Bissau), where two-thirds of the territory is at present liberated, the PAIGC,  under the direction of Amilcar Cabral, exercises effective control in the pacified areas, where a social and political infrastructure is being developed. The acts of Portuguese terrorism are in constant retreat in the face of the military offensive of the revolutionary forces of the PAIGC. Similarly, in Mozambique, where FRELIMO  has just opened a fourth battle- front in the province of Manikesso-Fala, popular action is gaining ground. The Portuguese enemy, which is endeavoring in vain to construct the Cabora Bassa and Cunene dams, will one day or another have to withdraw from this territory because, despite the logistic support of NATO, it is impossible for Portugal, which is a small country, to sustain the armed struggle even in the colony of Guinea (Bissau) alone. In this connexion it is comforting to note the recent reconciliation in Angola between the MPLA and the FNLA.  This means that new military offensives will be a sign of the intensification of armed struggle throughout the Territory. It is therefore to be hoped that the United Nations will not delay in giving its recognition to the movements in Angola and Mozambique in the same way as it did for the PAIGC. It should here be recalled that an unprecedented role has been played by the Special Mission to Guinea (Bissau) of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. That Mission of inquiry put on record how the struggle is going and how the program for economic and social development is progressing in the areas liberated by the PAIGC.\n204.\tThe Republic of Guinea wishes to pay a tribute to the three-man Mission whose report [A/8723/Rev.l, chap. X, annex I] constitutes for the Organization an example of objectivity which Fascist Portugal will not be able to impugn despite all its misleading propaganda aimed at concealing from the world the fact that it is being routed in the Portuguese Territories. \n205.\tIt is thus with pride that the Republic of Guinea welcomed in Conakry from 10 to 13 April 19-72 the Special Committee during the meetings it held in Africa. In the context of those meetings, the United Nations sent to Guinea (Bissau) a Mission that was able to see for itself that the only genuine authority in Guinea (Bissau)-the only legitimate and popular Government-is that of the PAIGC, and that without the massive aid which the NATO Powers render to the arch-colonialist Portuguese Government the Portuguese terrorists would have been cast into the sea years ago and would never have been able to take their banditry so far as to strike a blow against the life of the people of the Republic of Guinea. Everyone will agree that such a mission should equally be sent to Angola and Mozambique in order to confer upon the liberation movements in those Territories the recognition of the United Nations.\n206.\tAnother source of anxiety to which we must refer is the Middle East. The \\\"no war, no peace\\\" situation seems more or less to be becoming the status quo. Since 1967 the Zionist occupation forces have with impunity refused to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and have refused to withdraw from the occupied territories. It must be said that Israel would never have assumed that arrogant and contemptuous attitude towards our Organization had it not enjoyed the logistic support and complicity of certain NATO Powers. That is why my delegation would like to exhort our Organization, and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, \\\"to oblige Israel to withdraw behind the 1967 frontiers in order to make it possible for a lasting peace to be established in that sorely tried area.\n207.\tIn the same way, it is of paramount importance that our Organization finally find a solution to the sorry plight of the Palestinian refugees. That population, which has been a population of wanderers for about a quarter of a century, has undoubtedly been a victim of decisions taken by our Organization. It would therefore be logical for this Organization, with the guarantee of the permanent members of the Security Council, to decide to rehouse and indemnify the people that has been arbitrarily hounded from its native land.\n208.\tCan we be astonished at the sudden deterioration of the political situation in the Middle East and the consequent ever-growing resistance of Palestinian liberation movements? It is time-nay, it is high time that our Organization seriously got down to the task of restoring peace in the Middle East. It is precisely those who were responsible for the creation of the State of Israel and for depriving the Palestinians of their lands who are responsible for the increased tension and all the troubles that have been caused by the refugees, who are at the pinnacle of despair. The recent events in Munich are an example of the desperate manifestation of the victims of imperialist arbitrariness and oppression.\n209.\tIf oppression engenders its opposite armed resistance it can better be understood what sort of struggles peoples resolutely vow to wage against all forms of domination. It matters little whether the liberation movements, the legitimacy of whose struggles have been universally recognized, are called terrorist organizations or not That term is not enough to cast anathema on those who claim the same fundamental rights and the same prerogatives to a free and independent life in the community of nations we have achieved in the course of time. In some ways terrorism necessarily becomes a weapon of nations endowed with strength those very nations which yesterday, dominated by external forces and subjugated by nazism, resorted to weapons to liberate themselves.\n210.\tNothing could lead us to deprive our combatant brothers of their inalienable right to accede to independence and to national sovereignty. Some might wish to regard their acts of violence as simple acts by individuals or groups of individuals pursuing no particular ideal or national objective. That is to mistake effect for cause. Quite the contrary. One must go into the historical reasons that prompted this group of individuals to take up arms, despairing of their cause. To deny that reality is tantamount to denying history. The United Nations and the peoples it represents cannot acquiesce in such double talk, because that would be to question a fundamental axiom namely, the legitimacy of a liberation struggle. In fine, it would be to allow Vorster and Ian Smith, as well as Portugal and Israel, to invoke a right that has been rejected by mankind as a whole.\n211.\tTurning now to IndoChina, the distressing situation that prevails in that part of the world, and particularly in Viet-Nam, has pained all mankind. All peace-loving and justice-loving peoples have condemned the barbaric bombing and inhuman acts perpetrated against North Viet-Nam, and the Government of the United States must realize that American greatness can only be enhanced by the immediate cessation of those acts. The great people of the United States is aware of that, and is more and more massively demonstrating its opposition to that unsavory war.\n212.\tThe escalation in bombing has reached a new stage-the stage of large-scale genocide-whereas at the same time we observe that the peace talks are proceeding. It is rather difficult, we believe, to wish for peace when the enemy is escalating the war by systematically bombing dikes, hospitals and factories, thus putting a stop to the life of the nation. The blockade of VietNamese ports and the intensification of the conflicts in Cambodia and Laos are all reasons why the international community should be convinced that the peace proposals, as also the Paris talks, are in fact nothing but a subterfuge that can deceive no one, not even the people of the United States.\n213.\tFurthermore, we are informed that the position of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of South Viet-Nam has been frequently reaffirmed through the seven-point proposals that the heroic and indomitable people of Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam have constantly presented to the Government of the United States. No one can in any way doubt the sincerity and validity of the peace conditions offered by the VietNamese patriots. Therefore, we must repeat from this rostrum that the United States must finally face up to the facts. The entire world is clamoring for the immediate and unconditional cessation of this pernicious war, which has cost so many lives not only among the VietNamese but also among the American people that have been thus involved in a war which is as good as lost.\n214.\tStill in the Asian subcontinent, the talks recently initiated between South Korea and the Democratic Republic of Korea through the Red Cross are unprecedented in the history of a divided people. In this connexion it is edifying to note the merits of that people, which of its own volition has taken the initiative to reunite families divided for more than a quarter of a century. It will be noted that, in order to encourage that reunification effort, 29 States Members of this Organization, including my own country, the Republic of Guinea, took the initiative of requesting the inclusion of a new item on the agenda of the present session [A/8752 and Add.1-10] in order to convey to the Korean people the sentiments of solidarity of our Organization, because, actually, the international community cannot pass over such an event without comment, even if it is the result of negotiations that have been conducted without external interference. But at the same time, we were also aware that certain forces, always the same ones, would object, with the express purpose of jeopardizing those talks. We deplore the fact that when the agenda of this session was being adopted the proposed item was recommended for inclusion in the provisional agenda of the twenty-eighth session [2036th meeting]. However, we feel that we should repeat to those prophets of doom that despite their opposition to discussion of the Korean question at the present session, those delegations which sought to have that item included in the agenda are firmly convinced that the Korean people will effect its reunification independent of any divisive action on the part of imperialism, which seeks to perpetuate the division of the\nKorean peninsula in order better to exercise its flagging domination throughout the Asian continent.\n215.\tTurning to the problem of disarmament and the possible convening of a world disarmament conference, all countries must be associated in the various discussions. The problem of peace and other major international issues are of concern to the entire world. Peace must belong to everyone: two, three or four countries cannot take decisions on behalf of all continents; hence the problem of disarmament and, particularly, %e problem of peace are not the exclusive concern of one nation, however great or strong it may be. All these matters, which are connected with the prohibition of the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, are of concern to the Republic of Guinea, but we wish to discuss them together with all other countries, without having piecemeal, biased or false solutions imposed upon us.\n216.\tThe struggle against economic under-development is for our peoples another field of action in which our Governments are mobilizing all their human resources in order to tap their natural resources. However, economic disparities, which are accentuated by the constant impoverishment of our countries, give a gloomy omen for the realization of the goals of the Second United Nations Development Decade. The failure of the third session of UNCTAD is ample proof of this, despite the concerted efforts made by the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. It will be recalled that the Group of 77 developing countries, in adopting the Charter of Algiers  and the Lima Declaration,  not only defined the primary goals to be achieved by UNCTAD, but also contemplated measures to reconcile the interests of the peoples of the developing countries with those of the peoples of the industrialized countries. It will also be recalled that the present system of international trade is shot through with injustices and all sorts of tariff barriers imposed by the rich countries.\n217.\tThe fact of the matter is-and the delegation of Guinea has always emphasized this that no country can do without co-operation with others. The developed countries must be able to trade, in so far as possible, with the developing countries on a basis of equality and without discrimination. But at present there is an inequitable system of trade which has been imposed on the young States and, quite obviously, is the most universal form of imperialism.\n218.\tOur delegation agrees that no people can do without co-operation, whatever its state of development may be. For this co-operation to be lasting it is important that it be based on equality of terms of trade and on respect for the sovereignty, the rights and the legitimate interests of those States co-operating.\n219.\tSince the accession to independence of a great number of young States colonialism has donned the paternalistic garb of neocolonialism, using that cloak of assistance and co-operation , in order to exploit the so-called under-developed countries.\n220.\tThe truth is that every people is in quest of its happiness, and the foreign aid it receives should only be a supplement to its development. It is only through this approach that co-operation can be lasting and profitable. Genuine aid should help the recipient country to do without aid.\n221.\tIn order to make our contacts more fruitful it is high time that we considered the concepts of co-operation and mutual assistance in order to avoid any form of domination. It is also to be stressed that co-operation is not confined to trade, and for it to be equitable the cooperating parties must have absolutely identical views. It is not a question of developing countries measuring the assistance of more fortunate countries with a purely quantitative yardstick; the important thing is that what they receive be given without any political strings attached, such as the forfeiture of sovereignty, or interference in domestic affairs on the part of the donor country.\n222.\tThe developed countries demonstrated in Santiago, Chile, that they were not willing to co-operate with the developing countries on the basis of the terms proffered to them by those who wished to develop their economies.\n223.\tWe in the developing countries must therefore concert all our efforts in order to bring about concrete results; in so doing we must rely first and foremost on our efforts and organize ourselves in such a way as to ensure that the people exercise power directly and have the opportunity to unleash all its creative energies.\n224.\tSome may assert that poor countries will never be able to develop without money. We in Guinea believe that productive labor alone creates those values which crystallize in the form of hard cash; it is the source of development and of the revolutionary reordering of our societies. Without labor, the money which might be given to us would only serve to corrupt us, make us idle and enslave us.\n225.\tIf even after the two preceding sessions, which we agreed to call stock-taking sessions, problems still preoccupy a great number of countries-particularly as regards the strengthening of the effectiveness of the role of the Unite.\\\" Nations-it is here our common task to consider and to solve those problems. Inter alia, I would refer first to the problem of the strengthening of the actions of our Organization in the solution of problems and, above all, international conflicts; secondly, to the revision of the United Nations Charter, because, while, when the Charter was originally signed the Organization comprised only about 50 countries, today it has gathered in its 132 independent, sovereign States.\n226.\tHence the United Nations Charter needs to be revised in view of the requirements which are arising from the presence in the Organization of new Member States. It is new inconceivable that just a few countries should be able to impose their will on others. Not only would our delegation support any proposal likely to adapt the provisions of the United Nations Charter to the principle of the sovereign equality of nations, but also we denounce the existence and, very often, the misuse of the right of the veto. That right favors exclusively the interests of those five countries in which it is vested in their capacity as permanent members of the Security Council. Hence the use of the right of veto violates those democratic principles which should govern the work of the United Nations. We must therefore abolish that practice in order to set our Organization on a genuinely democratic path, taking into account the number of countries which have been admitted to membership.\n227.\tFurthermore, my delegation deplores the fact that certain Powers-namely, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the German Democratic Republic-should be excluded from this international Organization, despite the fact that they meet all those conditions laid down by the Charter. Need we point out that the peoples of those countries have frequently given concrete proof of their love of peace and have made excellent contributions to the political, economic, social and cultural evolution of the world in this twentieth century.\n228.\tBy way of conclusion, I should like to say, on behalf of my Government, how proud I am that you, Mr. President, were elected to preside over this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election gives new and immense hope to all those who have struggled and continue to struggle for the ideals of peace and democratic progress. To you, as well as to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, I should like to reiterate the confidence of my people and Government.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am happy to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that you will guide the affairs of this Assembly with tact and impartiality, and we assure you of our full co-operation. We also rejoice in the honor thus shown your country, Poland, a country with a long record of dedication to the cause of disarmament and European detente and a country with which Denmark maintains good neighborly relations across the Baltic Sea.\n2.\tAllow me, Mr. President, to take this opportunity also to welcome the Secretary-General to his high and exacting office. He may rely upon our whole-hearted co-operation and support in his arduous task. We are happy to witness his determination to uphold the principles of objectivity and integrity which his predecessors have handed down to him.\n3.\tIt is a sad paradox of our time that the generally accepted need for increased and closer international cooperation is accompanied by continuing and persistent national self-assertion. This conflict between the true needs of the modern world for global rules to guide the conduct of sovereign States while respecting their individual identity on the one hand and their stubborn sense of self-sufficiency on the other illustrates the dilemma of the United Nations.\n4.\tThe choice is becoming increasingly clear: either we decide to co-operate globally so as to deal constructively and impartially with our manifold problems or we miss the opportunity of developing an orderly international society. The choice would appear to be easy; but it presupposes that we are ready to discard old and, indeed, outmoded notions in favor of a rational build-up of a human society within a universal and impartial Organization.\n5.\tThe past year has seen some good and promising features. In the political field, progress has chiefly manifested itself in the relations of the major Powers and in the continuing development of a detente in Europe. In other areas of political confrontation the picture is more diffuse. Despite the often active involvement of the United Nations far too many problems remain outside what the Secretary-General has called the emergence of an era of negotiation, dialog and contact. Throughout the year, and not least in recent months, we have, moreover, witnessed acts of atrocity and random terror that threaten the very fabric of a civilized community.\n6.\tIn the economic, social and humanitarian fields, actual progress may seem limited and it certainly remains inadequate. Nevertheless, the Organization is demonstrating both imagination and drive in these spheres. And that should not be under-estimated, because it is through such means that a global community in the proper sense of the word may gradually be established.\n7.\tFirst of all, a turning-point in United States-Soviet relations was reached through the successful outcome of the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in May. The favorable impact of this development on the general international situation is obvious. In Europe it is already manifest. We hope and trust that the spirit of accommodation and co-operation will prevail.\n8.\tWhen we consider that for over 20 years there was practically no contact between the United States and China, it is a matter of great significance that the basis for direct communication has now been established and is being developed. We may now hope for an improvement of the international situation, particularly in the Pacific area.\n9.\tIt must be fair to assume that we have seen only the beginning of an era of negotiation. In saying that, I do not intend to minimize the vital, legitimate interests at stake, nor do I suggest that the problems involved can easily be solved. But these recent developments may be taken to prove that the major Powers have realized that in international affairs nothing compares favorably with an agreed solution.\n10.\tIn Europe the trend towards detente and increased co-operation is gaining momentum. The ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  and between the Federal Republic and Poland  and the Berlin agreement concluded by the four Powers  have prepared the ground for the opening this autumn in Helsinki of multilateral talks preparatory to the conference on security and co-operation in Europe.\n11.\tIt is of course premature to anticipate the results of that conference, but in the opinion of the Danish Government the project holds far-reaching new aspects and potentialities. Since the conference will cover security as well as co-operation, we for our part would wish it to deal also with the problem of freer movement of people, ideas and information. For if we do not begin to tackle these problems we shall not be able ultimately to break down the artificial barriers between governments and peoples.\n12.\tMy Government hopes that negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic will soon result in a general agreement satisfactory to both parties, thus paving the way to a normalization of their relations with other countries and also with this Organization.\n13.\tIn other parts of the world there are also trends towards improved relations between countries which have so far been divided by serious differences. The Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan of 3 July 1972 is an example of two Governments seeking agreed solutions in the face of obvious difficulties. We hope that in spite of recurrent complications the spirit of Simla will prevail, thereby improving conditions on the subcontinent as a whole and not least for the new State of Bangladesh.\n14.\tIn this connexion let me emphasize that Denmark firmly supports the application of Bangladesh for membership in the United Nations [A/8754]. It is most unfortunate that the Security Council has not been able to agree on a recommendation, and we urge that the Council reconsider the case. We hope, therefore, that a solution will be found during this session that will render Bangladesh full justice, help to create improved conditions on the subcontinent and be beneficial to our Organization.\n15.\tIn Korea promising developments are under way. After years of serious disagreements in the wake of war the Governments of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have initiated contacts in order to tackle and in time, it is hoped, solve the many problems dividing them. In 1971 the Danish Government supported the postponement of a debate on the Korean question in the hope that a dialog might get under way. The agreement embodied in the Joint Communique of 4 July this year [A/8727, annex I] justified this hope. We therefore felt that the best contribution which the United Nations could make at this stage towards the peaceful reunification of Korea would be' to refrain from an acrimonious debate which could only hamper the efforts of the Korean peoples themselves to find a solution to their problems. Denmark, which already has diplomatic relations of long standing with the Republic of Korea, is taking concrete steps now with a view to developing contacts also with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n16 Even if progress in the fields of disarmament and arms control leaves much to be desired, the spirit of detente is discernible.\n3 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971.\n17.\tDenmark welcomes the agreements on the limitation of strategic arms which have so far been concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union.  We hope that the continued negotiations between the two Powers will lead to further results in this vital field.\n18.\tAs for the question of a complete ban on nuclear tests, I should like to reiterate that it would seem as if bridging the gap in the question of verification were mainly a matter of policy. The Danish Government urges the greatest nuclear Powers to lend their indispensable co-operation to the preparation of a complete test-ban treaty, thus taking the lead which it behoves them to take by virtue of their power and responsibility. Intensified efforts should now be made to obtain, in the near future, a complete ban on chemical weapons. We welcome the endeavours which the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has made so far in this field, and we hope that the Committee will be able to present concrete and satisfactory proposals to the next session of the General Assembly.\n19.\tDenmark welcomes the prospect of a world disarmament conference, trusting that it may serve to promote progress and bring about constructive results. Clearly, in order to achieve that end, the conference must be thoroughly prepared and enjoy wide support in the international community, particularly on the part of all nuclear Powers. We hope, therefore, that the General Assembly will be able to decide on the preparations for such a conference. My Government would be willing to take rm active part in such preparations.\n20.\tSo much for the positive trends in the present international situation. If it is justified to say that they dominate the picture, it is nevertheless a deplorable fact that in some cases the possibilities of negotiation have not been exploited to the full.\n21.\tIn Viet-Nam the war is still raging, and there is no immediate prospect of peace. The inconclusiveness until now of almost four years of negotiation is tragic in its consequences for the long-suffering population of VietNam. The misery and the losses caused by the war and by the recent escalation and extension of the warfare, and in particular the. massive bombings, have deeply upset the Danish people. The conflict in Viet-Nam must be solved through a political settlement guaranteeing the Vietnamese people their right to decide their own future without any kind of external interference.\n22.\tIn the Middle East political efforts have been deadlocked for a long time, and the recent tragic events at the Olympic Games created further complications. They should not, however, be allowed to jeopardize endeavors to reactivate political efforts aimed at a just and lasting peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We reaffirm our full support of the mission of Ambassador Jarring under that resolution and we urge all the parties concerned to cooperate whole-heartedly in such efforts.\n23.\tLike previous sessions, this General Assembly is faced with an almost total absence of progress towards the solution of the serious problems of apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa.\n24.\tThe only exception is Namibia, where the Secretary- General, under the mandate entrusted to him by the Security Council, has been able to establish contacts with the parties concerned. It is to be hoped that this initiative will promote a solution of the question of Namibia based upon the self-determination of the people. But at this early stage it remains to be seen whether such a hope will be justified.\n25.\tThe past year saw the rejection by a majority of the population in Rhodesia of the proposals for a settlement which, it was felt, did not meet just expectations. In the. present circumstances there is no alternative to the policy of sanctions. It is to be hoped that the membership in its entirety will live up to its obligations under the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council in this matter. One lesson has been clearly reaffirmed: any solution of the Rhodesian question must be acceptable to the population as a whole.\n26.\tIn the present situation we must assist victims of the conflicts stemming from the continuation of apartheid and of colonial rule. This is in accordance with the best humanitarian traditions. Denmark for one has increased its humanitarian and educational assistance to oppressed peoples and groups in cases where the Security Council has called for such assistance or has stated a case of oppression. Our assistance may be rendered through international organizations as well as through liberation movements.\n27.\tA most alarming aspect of the present international situation is the threat against the rights and the security of individuals stemming from the rising tide of terrorism and senseless acts of violence. Such acts are also a menace to the very foundation upon which friendly and peaceful relations between nations are based. International co-operation is required to reverse the current trend towards terrorism, and all nations must recognize their responsibility in this field. The Danish Government for its part is ready to participate in realistic efforts to eliminate this threat to mankind.\n28.\tThe most immediate practical measures which could be taken would be to safeguard the security of civil aviation. In this field a legal basis for countermeasures has already been established, and I fully support the call of the Secretary-General for the ratification by all countries of the three existing international Conventions relating to crimes against civil aviation.\n29.\tIt is most deplorable that even States are violating the rights of security of the individual. This year we have witnessed the massacre of groups of people. We have seen arbitrary expulsion of large numbers of people from their country of domicile. We also deplore rigid limitations on the right of the individual to leave his country on legitimate grounds. There is an urgent need for all countries to accede to and to respect the various instruments on human rights adopted by the United Nations.\n30.\tPermit me now to make a few comments on the role of the United Nations in promoting economic and social progress. Measured against the lofty ideals which marked the beginning of the first United Nations Development Decade, the progress made in the economic and social fields cannot but be considered starkly insufficient by those millions who are still suffering from undernourishment, unemployment and lack of education.\n31.\tHowever, over the years, our knowledge of the complex nature of development has grown, and more and more aspects of the development process have been included in the international co-operation for economic and social progress which has evolved under the auspices of the United Nations. During 1972 two major international conferences bore witness to this expanded international co-operation, the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [VNCTADJ, held in Santiago in April and May 1972, and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June 1972.\n32.\tConsidering that the months preceding the session of UNCTAD saw the most acute crisis in international monetary and trade relations since the Second World War, the results of the Conference were, in the view of the Danish Government, far from insignificant. Thus, agreement was reached on the principle of full and effective participation of developing countries in the decision-making process of the international monetary system as well as on the principle of participation of all developing countries in the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATTJ. Another important achievement of the third session of UNCTAD was its demonstration of world solidarity with the least developed among the developing countries. We are satisfied that steps have already been taken to ensure action in these areas in accordance with the recommendations of the Conference.\n33.\tThe Stockholm Conference on its part made us more conscious of the limits to growth and of the need for protection and improvement of the human environment in order to safeguard the quality of life. Although conceptions of the nature and the urgency of these problems differed from one group of countries to another, the Conference succeeded in arriving at important recommendations for future collective efforts. We trust that this General Assembly, comprising the full membership of the United Nations, will be able to approve the report of the Conference without disturbing the very delicate balance which was obtained in Stockholm. The problems covered by the two conferences-although of overriding importance are but elements in the total challenge facing us in the economic and social field.\n34.\tWithin the United Nations family of organizations international co-operation is taking place to solve a wide \nrange of other crucial problems such as population growth, urbanization, industrialization, social security, employment, nutrition and health. The steady expansion of human knowledge creates new problems and demands. It is the task of the Economic and Social Council to analyze these trends, to propose new ways of co-operation, to ensure coherence of policies and to co-ordinate work. We support the steps which have been taken during the last year to make the Council more fit to assist the developing countries in their struggle for economic and social progress and to advance scientific and technological co-operation among all Member States. The Danish Government continues to attach great importance to the role of the United Nations family of organizations in the field of development aid. It is our hope that there will be increased recognition among developed countries of the particular advantages to the developing world of these multilateral programs. As stated in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the objective of development must be to bring about sustained improvements in the well-being of the individual. My country is confident that the United Nations will have an ever-growing role to play in common efforts towards this goal.\n35.\tI feel bound to make a somewhat discouraging observation about our Organization. In spite of the importance which Member States attach to the proper functioning of the United Nations it has not yet been possible to find a solution to its financial crisis. It is the joint responsibility of all Member States to find a speedy solution of this problem, and the financial implications should not present any major obstacle to such a solution. Some countries, among them Denmark, have already years ago made voluntary financial contributions. It would seem as if determined endeavors by the membership in general are long overdue. We therefore hope and urge that the Special Committee on the Financial Situation of the United Nations be enabled to present a proposal in the matter to this session of the General Assembly. A solution of the financial problems is one prerequisite for a better and more efficient United Nations. But it is not the only one, and not even the most important one. If we are to achieve the purposes of the Charter it is necessary that Member States adjust their policies and their behavior to the principles of the Charter and that they be prepared to co-operate fully in. their application. This is the only valid way to strengthen the United Nations for the benefit of the international community. It is a question of the political will and vision of all Member States.\n36.\tI have deliberately set aside of the conclusion of my statement the all-important preoccupation of the Danish Government at this very moment: the entry of Denmark into the European Communities. The Danish Government has signed the agreement of accession to the European Communities.  The Danish Parliament has approved this agreement by an overwhelming majority. The final decision will now be taken in a referendum to be held Monday next, 2 October. My Government trusts that the Danish people will ensure the entry of Denmark into the European\nCommunities as from the beginning of 1973. The firm position of the Danish Government in this matter is accounted for by important political as well as economic reasons. Politically, after centuries of rivalry, instability, political tensions, and sometimes even war, European countries have agreed to co-operate and thus preclude any recurrence of that unfortunate state of affairs. The Danish Government looks forward to playing its positive role in such a co-operation, which in our view should concentrate on problems of immediate concern to the European countries and avoid duplicating discussions which could more naturally be conducted in other forums-for instance in this forum.\n37.\tEconomically, Denmark's accession to the European Communities will make for economic progress and for a rise in production-not an end in itself, but a prerequisite for the continuation of a policy of reforms designed to improve conditions for the entire Danish population. In improving economic and political conditions in Europe, co-operation in the enlarged European Communities will be beneficial to the international community as a whole. It will provide opportunities for greater stability in the monetary field, for increased world trade and for increased aid to developing countries. Therefore, I for my part look upon the \\\"Yes\\\" which I trust the Danish population will voice next Monday as not only a contribution to regional co-operation; I see it in the broader context of the demands of international cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me, on behalf of my delegation, to associate myself with previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My delegation is convinced that with your wisdom and vast experience to guide us, this session of the Assembly will be able to cope successfully with the problems with which it is being confronted. I should like to congratulate also the 17 Vice-Presidents on their election. My delegation is certain that their wise counsel will be of utmost benefit to us all in the deliberations upon which we have embarked.\n70.\tMy delegation feels flattered by, and grateful for, the laudatory remarks made by delegations in their tributes to your predecessor. It has indeed been an honor for my country to have shared with this Assembly the services of Adam Malik, one of Indonesia's prominent and outstanding citizens.\n71.\tAllow me also to convey to our distinguished Secretary-General Indonesia's congratulations on his assumption of his high and exacting office. The efforts that he has made during the course of this year in the interest of universal peace and security deserve our whole-hearted support and appreciation. On this occasion our warm thoughts and deep gratitude also go to U Thant, our former Secretary-General, a great son of Asia, who occupied the highest executive office of our Organization during a decade of turbulence.\n72.\tIndonesia's view on the issues that confront mankind today cannot be separated from the fact that we are a nation whose cultural heritage is deeply embedded in the South-East Asian region. It is profoundly influenced by events and problems of that region.\n73.\tFor Indonesia, situated in an area of the world that continues to suffer under strains of war and human sorrow, the strengthening of international peace and security cannot but be of primary importance. The atmosphere of detente which is now being felt in the international political arena will, we hope, facilitate the further efforts of the big Powers to reduce tensions between them. Indonesia welcomes this detente, which has been accentuated by the meetings between leaders of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, respectively. We consider the agreement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union as a result of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks as an important step towards disarmament. It represents, however, only a beginning and we recognize that much more remains to be done before we are really on the road to complete disarmament.\n74.\tIt must be stressed here that a detente among the big Powers does not automatically bring about conditions of peace and security in all regions of the world. We still witness hotbeds of conflicts persisting in South-East Asia, the Middle East and southern Africa. Another aspect of this phenomenon is the tendency of the great Powers to ignore the small and medium-sized members of the international community and by-pass the United Nations in their search for solutions to world problems. Peace and security, however, should be the concern of all nations, both large and small, and all countries must be encouraged to play an active role in the achievement of these important goals.\n75.\tIt was with these considerations in mind that Indonesia voted for resolution 2833 (XXVI), which recommends the convening of a world disarmament conference open to all States. My delegation believes that careful preparations should precede such a conference.\n76.\tAt this juncture, while the concept of a world disarmament conference is still in its embryonic stage, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva remains the only negotiating body under the United Nations umbrella entrusted with the problems of disarmament. The most urgent issue to be solved by a Conference at this stage is an agreement on a comprehensive nuclear- test ban. Pending such an agreement, a moratorium on all nuclear testing is most desirable. Meanwhile, it is to be regretted that, notwithstanding General Assembly resolutions 1910 (XVIII) and 2828 C (XXVI) on nuclear-weapon tests, certain States continue their nuclear-weapon testing.\n77.\tMy delegation notes with sorrow and deep regret that the end of bloodshed and suffering in Viet-Nam, in the Khmer Republic and in Laos is not yet in sight. Hundreds of thousands of precious human lives have been extinguished, a much greater number of persons have been maimed, and devastation of indescribable magnitude has ravaged these lands; but the war in Viet-Nam and in the other countries of Indochina, which has lasted for more than one generation, still goes on. Located close to this scene of war, Indonesia yearns for peace in this region. It is for this reason that Indonesia and other countries in South-East Asia have exerted themselves to help find solutions that may end the fighting and establish genuine peace. Our view remains that the future of Viet-Nam, of the Khmer Republic and of Laos should be decided by the peoples themselves without outside interference. Withdrawal of all foreign forces from the territories of the countries concerned is a prerequisite for the return of peace to these war-torn lands. It is important, however, to remind ourselves that the events in VietNam, in the Khmer Republic and in Laos, while closely interrelated, are not entirely similar in origin and character.\n78.\tThe situation in the Middle East shows no signs of improvement. Israel's adamant defiance of United Nations resolutions, in particular the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), is the principal cause of the tension in the area, which has been continuously aggravated by Israel's armed incursions and air raids into the neighboring Arab countries. Moreover, Israel's continued illegal occupation of Arab territory and its persistent denial of fundamental human rights to the Palestinians are in direct violation of the United Nations Charter. Expansion of territory by force of arms cannot be condoned. The United Nations must be able to act effectively to ensure implementation by Israel of the relevant resolutions.\n79.\tWe also see no progress, in the solution of the problems of Namibia, of Portuguese colonialism or of apartheid and racism in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, Indonesia views the task entrusted to the Secretary-General under Security Council resolution 309 (1972) as a new approach which must not be allowed to undermine the legal status which Namibia has attained. The sovereign integrity and unity of Namibia and the Namibian people must remain the basis for any contact between the Secretary-General or his emissary and the racist regime of South Africa.\n80.\tAs to the Territories of Africa still under Portuguese colonial domination, it is heartening to note that, for the first time in the history of decolonization, the Special Mission of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples visited the liberated areas of Guinea (Bissau) in April 1972. After having considered the Mission's report [A/8723/Rev.l, chap. X, annex I], the Special Committee, of which Indonesia has the honor to be a member, passed a resolution recognizing the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde as the only authentic and representative liberation movement in Guinea (Bissau) [ibid., chap. X, para. 34]. Indonesia recommends strongly that the United Nations increase its assistance to the liberation movements fighting against Portuguese colonial domination.\n81.\tThe twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, in its waning days, saw the flames of war engulfing the South Asian subcontinent. As we begin our twenty-seventh session, those tragic days have become part of history. It is the fervent hope of my delegation that the current negotiations between India and Pakistan, both close friends of Indonesia, will continue to be fruitful. Indonesia has established diplomatic relations with the new nation of Bangladesh. We regret that this new State has been denied membership in the United Nations. Indonesia firmly believes that Bangladesh should be accepted as a Member, as this is in accordance with the Charter and the principle of universality. At the same time we hope that the outstanding issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan, especially the serious matter of the return of prisoners of war to Pakistan, can be expeditiously resolved and the way paved for normal and peaceful relations between those two countries.\n82.\tIndonesia views the current efforts towards rapprochement on the part of the two Koreas as an encouraging development, and hopes that the Korean people in both parts of that divided country will be able to continue to widen the areas of agreement between them. The efforts of the leaders in the north and south deserve all the support that the international community can provide. It is incumbent upon all of us to assist in the creation of an atmosphere conducive to the success of the direct negotiations now going on between the two Governments.\n83.\tThe recent tragic incident in Munich resulting in the loss of lives of innocent people is to be regretted. At the same time, Indonesia calls upon the international community not to have a limited perspective concerning these desperate acts committed by desperate people. This tragedy, like other actions in a string of violent events which are occurring on a world-wide scale, must not be viewed as an isolated phenomenon. Rather, it must be considered within the framework of the grave problems which have gripped the Middle East and other areas for so long and for which no solutions have been found. We have to consider the root-causes of those problems and try to solve them. Otherwise, the world community will continue to be plagued by a recurrence of such tragedies. If the General Assembly in this present session is prepared, with a strong sense of urgency, to address itself to the question of so-called international terrorism, we should be no less aware of the urgency in remedying the underlying causes leading to these acts of violence.\n84.\tIndonesia is a nation whose national territory includes more than 13,000 islands. Since more than half of its territory consists of the sea, Indonesia is vitally interested in the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. We hope that the projected conference on the law of the sea will succeed in establishing universally accepted legal concepts and rules governing the exploitation of the natural riches of the sea-bed and ocean floor and other unsettled issues of the law of the sea, taking into consideration the legitimate national interests of coastal States. We are particularly interested in seeing the archipelago concept accepted by the international community, as this concept constitutes a safeguard and a guarantee for the political, economic and social unity of island-nations like Indonesia.\n85.\tThe twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly adopted resolution 2832 (XXVI), which declares the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. As a State bordering the Indian Ocean, Indonesia considers this resolution of signal importance. However, the proper implementation of the resolution requires the existence of mutual trust and understanding among the coastal States. Furthermore, a certain consensus should exist among the coastal States themselves as to what the zone of peace should mean in practice before consultations can be held with outside Powers with a view to observing the terms of the declaration. Such a consensus can only be brought about through negotiations between the parties concerned. This is by no means an easy task, but the collective will of these coastal States will, it is to be hoped, prevent resolution 2832 (XXVI) from becoming a dead letter.\n86.\tFully realizing the detrimental effects of power politics in many parts of the world including their own region, member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] are very much concerned to keep their region outside the sphere of power rivalries and power conflicts in order to enable them to concentrate their efforts on the betterment of their peoples. It is for this reason that the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia welcomed Malaysia's initiative for the neutralization of South-East Asia. The concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality is embodied in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration.3 My colleague and friend the Chairman of the Malaysian delegation has already dwelt at length on this subject from this rostrum [2039th meeting], and I can only add that my delegation fully shares his views.\n87.\tThe region of South-East Asia has enormous potential for economic growth and development. It is rich in resources and the people are dedicated to the economic and social improvement of their respective nations. It is a region which, through the centuries, has attracted traders from many parts of the world and was subsequently colonized by Western empires. Now that it has freed itself from colonial domination, it finds itself becoming a focal point in the international power game. It is therefore not by accident that these countries of South-East Asia, which are at the early states of economic development, have felt the need for regional co-operation.\n88.\tASEAN has already proved a useful instrument for enhancing mutual assistance and co-operation in the economic and cultural fields. It has also become increasingly important as a framework for the protection of regional economic interests in relation to other economic communities.\n89.\tOne of the intangible but no less important results is that ASEAN has created a certain measure of common identity and a feeling of unity among its members. They firmly believe that this co-operation within ASEAN will promote the stability of their region, which in turn will contribute to the consolidation of world peace and security. Our regional efforts should therefore be seen as an integral part of global endeavors to create a better world for man.\n90.\tRegional stability, however, can be effectively developed only if each component part develops its own national resilience. The strengthening of national resilience, which is the over-all capability to resist outside negative influences and pressures on the basis of political stability and economic well-being, together with an increasing sense of unity and common identity, will likewise enhance the resilience of the region as a whole.\n91.\tI believe that none of us will disagree with the view that the world economy does not develop in favor of the developing countries. Based on preliminary data, the rate of growth of those countries in 1971 was below the target rate of the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n3 Declaration issued by the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, held at Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971.\n92.\tAlthough the recent economic performance of a number of these countries appeared to be satisfactory, the fact remains that most of them are lagging behind on the road to progress. Their relative position in world trade continues to worsen because of the chronic unfavorable development of their terms of trade and because of lagging exports, caused in part by the growing difficulties faced by their traditional exports with regard to access to the markets of the developed countries.\n93.\tFurthermore, the international monetary situation is such that an atmosphere of uncertainty prevails among the developing countries with regard to their foreign exchange reserves as well as their prospective export earnings. Its negative effects on economic development are further amplified by the reduction in development assistance. Several developed countries have failed to make progress towards achieving the 1 per cent target of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], while the average terms and conditions of their aid have hardened. The developing countries face the danger of a reversal in the net flow of capital from the developing to the developed countries as a result of debt servicing, capital repatriation and profit transfer.\n94.\tIt is unfortunate that the third session of UNCTAD ended with only inconclusive results and failed to contribute concretely to the solution of the fundamental problems confronting the developing countries.\n95.\tThese developments are running counter to the commitments jointly undertaken by all nations under the International Development Strategy. They make evident the urgent need for substantial reform and innovation. In this connexion it might be useful to recall the statement made by Mr. McNamara, President of the World Bank, at that session,  in which he expressed his deep concern about the unacceptable state of development in most of the developing countries and emphasized the urgent need for moving forward with practical measures.\n96.\tThose and some other problems relating to development are now on the agenda of our current session. I trust that, if the political will exists, especially with the rich countries represented here, the General Assembly can make a positive contribution towards practical solutions.\n97.\tThe developing countries have made it clear that in the endeavor to find solutions to economic problems in which their very interests are at stake, they want to be full participants and active partners. First and foremost is the problem of international monetary reform, for which an urgent solution is required. Of equal importance are the 1972 multilateral trade negotiations, which must not be conducted along the traditional lines of negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but should comprise all aspects which are identified as barriers to trade. Special ground rules, modalities and techniques for the participation of developing countries should be worked out to ensure that these countries will really benefit from the results.\n98.\tWith regard to development assistance, my delegation joins its voice with those of other delegations in appealing to developed countries to adhere to the targets set out in the International Development Strategy.\n99.\tWhile I am on the subject of international aid, allow me to say a few words regarding the activities of the United Nations in the operational field, namely that of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP], since we consider it one of the most successful and rewarding enterprises in the international joint endeavor, which has already done a great deal for the cause of the developing countries. Indonesia is one of the countries that has benefited from UNDP's activities, especially after the approval of its program for the first cycle by the UNDP Governing Council at its fourteenth session. Indonesia is most appreciative of this fact, and would like to express its hope and confidence that a more dynamic growth in the over-all resources could be made available so as to enable the program to grow substantially in the subsequent cycles.\n100.\tAnother example of a successful joint endeavor was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, which has contributed considerably to making man more aware of the serious threat that exists to his total environment on earth. The Conference has provided us with valuable recommendations as to how man can begin to correct the destruction which he himself has wrought upon the ecology of the earth. My delegation would like to stress that, in the formulation of international action concerning environmental problems, the needs of the developing countries should be given adequate consideration.\n101.\tTurning now to the national economy, I am happy to state that there is manifestly an expansion of economic activities in Indonesia-not only in the agricultural sector, which still has priority in our development policy, but also in the industrial sector, especially in the extractive industries.\n102.\tIn spite of a definite shift from a deficit to a surplus in the routine budget, thus enabling the Government to release more domestic resources for investment, the development budget still has a heavy foreign component derived from bilateral as well as multilateral assistance. At the same time, the Government encourages foreign investment to participate in the development efforts, and it can be said that so far there is a satisfactory influx of investment capital in Indonesia.\n103.\tThe decreasing demand in many industrialized countries for our major primary commodities, along with the resultant drop in prices, on the one hand, and the higher cost of importing capital goods, on the other, may well result in negative balances of payments, jeopardizing our development efforts. Indonesia feels that a wider access to the markets of the developed countries for our export commodities through the elimination or progressive reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers is an indispensable requirement for our development effort.\n104.\tAnother negative trend discernible in the past two years has been the diminishing willingness to transfer capital to less-developed countries.\n105.\tThe development process in Indonesia has reached a point at which a larger economic basis has already been created as a launching pad for a subsequent development undertaking on a bigger scale, which in turn requires larger amounts of financing. Such financing could not be covered by domestic resources alone, but has to be increasingly supplemented with outside financial assistance.\n106.\tMy delegation would like to stress that external aid and participation in Indonesia's economic development can be accepted only on the basis of \\\"no strings attached\\\", in order not to limit our freedom of decision in accordance with our independent and active foreign policy.\n107.\tWe who are firm believers in the United Nations cannot fail to note the growing lack of confidence in the United Nations and its institutions, especially among youth.\n108.\tThe important role of youth today in world affairs was duly recognized by this Assembly last year when it resolved that a mural should be painted at United Nations Headquarters to commemorate the World Youth Assembly [resolution 2896 (XXVI)]. It is to youth that we shall pass on the United Nations its successes as well as its failures- and they are the ones who will carry on our work in saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It is imperative that we restore their confidence in the United Nations-firstly, by ensuring through performance and achievements that the Organization really stands for the lofty principles and purposes of the Charter, and, secondly, by interesting them and including them in the work of our Organization, which the Secretary general so aptly described as the most profitable long-term investment ever made in human history.\n109.\tIt would be appropriate for my delegation to recall in this connexion the statement made by Mr. Adam Malik in his inaugural address as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly:\n\\\"We must realize that, unless the United Nations makes sense and is meaningful to the youth of today, the Organization is doomed to atrophy or irrelevance.\n\\\"... for all the confusion and contradictions that mark their emergence, these younger generations are the carriers of a new idealism; they are the vehicles of... global human solidarity, cutting across national boundaries. ...\n\\\"We have to harness their idealism and give it concrete international purpose by relating it to the accumulated experience and knowledge within the United Nations\\\". [1934th meeting, paras. 53-59.]\n110. In conclusion I should like to assure the Assembly of the readiness of the Indonesian delegation to co-operate fully in an objective and realistic manner, with you, Mr. President, with all delegations represented here and with the Secretary-General in our quest for solutions to the problems and issues confronting the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "The presence of the illustrious economist and Polish diplomat and politician, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski presiding over the General Assembly of the United Nations is an open tribute to his outstanding ability and an implicit tribute to his great country. Poland, the land of heroes and artists, a nation of heroism and sacrifice, has always given us persons of great valor. We are sure that our President will guide the work of our Organization with the hand of a master.\n137.\tI also wish to take this opportunity to express to Mr. Adam Malik the appreciation of my delegation for the wise and correct way in which he presided over the twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly.\n138.\tOn 1 January of this year, Mr. Kurt Waldheim replaced U Thant as Secretary-General of our Organization. UThant carried on his shoulders for many years the enormous responsibility as the executive and co-ordinating organ of the United Nations before relinquishing his post. The Bolivian delegation wishes to reiterate our tribute and admiration to the ex-Secretary-General, and we express our hopes for success to Mr. Waldheim, who has arrived at a moment of great concern, of grave risks, but also one of noble hopes and expectations. We trust that Providence will enlighten his mind and that the United Nations, under his administration, will regain the faith and confidence of the peoples of the world under a single ideal of peace and justice.\n139.\tA year ago when I first appeared before this great forum, in speaking of my country I was able to state:\n\\\"Revolution is proceeding now in Bolivia on the basis of a unanimous consensus and along the glorious path of full nationalism. It will always be welcome in America, as elsewhere, so long as it preserves its autonomy and the hallmark of genuine authenticity. When the revolution tries to transfer its own sovereignty it becomes anti-national and hence anti-American.\\\" [1957th meeting, para. 56.]\n140.\tToday, after a reasonable time has elapsed which has allowed us, as a dynamic young nation to get an over-all view and glimpse the main trends and goals, I can say now that the impression I had then, far from being lost or attenuated, has become clearer, and today the Government is supported by a great majority of the people, which is a source of great satisfaction to those of us who entered into a solemn commitment with history.\n141.\tBolivia today is living through a glorious moment in its republican history, because it lives in peace and order, which are daily being strengthened, because it is based on the peaceful governing of the national life, on the rebirth of our institutions and on the moral and economic rehabilitation of the country after a number of years of turmoil and of anxiety.\n142.\tI expressed to this Assembly at that time my hope for the flowering of my country. At that time it was a certainty based on faith, on my knowledge as a fighting man and a man who knew my people well. But I was also encouraged because I shared the concerns and the dangers of a leader of outstanding virtues and patriotism, Colonel Hugo Banzer Suarez, who at that time was beginning his term of office. Today it is different. Intuition based on a sound approach to one's civic duties has given way to a conviction strengthened by what the nationalist regime has done for the people of Bolivia, and I am honored to represent that nationalist regime in this distinguished gathering today.\n143.\tI digress for a moment because I believe that the United Nations is not, nor can it be, disinterested in what happens among its Member States. In an organization of this nature I believe that there are no irrelevant problems, that mankind's destiny is a single one, and for those of us who compose the international community the hope and disappointments, successes and failures of any Member must affect all the Assembly, which is the home of all where both our joys and our sufferings must be heard.\n144.\tThe main concern of the nationalist and popular regime of Bolivia has been to bring law and order to our society. We have guaranteed all forms of freedom, the only restrictions being those that flow from a need to maintain social peace and to fight against all terrorist tactics that had plunged the citizenry into a state of constant fear. Here the Government has been inflexible and severe but just, because the excesses that occurred during the two previous Governments took a heavy toll of innocent victims and brought the country to the brink of chaos.\n145.\tDue to the overweening arrogance of the extremist forces and the impotence of the authorities which were very often guilty of complicity, unprecedented crimes took place in Bolivia, including the cowardly crimes that caused victims among journalists, the assassination of the peasants' leaders, the trials of the combatants who were accused of desertion, and the kidnappings that, on the pretext of raising money for subversion, paved the way for a new form of extortion hitherto unknown in my country.\n146.\tThe basic desire of my Government to encourage the rule of law and the unimpeachable majesty of the courts of justice led to the enactment of a new organic law of the judiciary. This body of law is based on a broad sense of humanism, and in accordance with the most modern of juridical techniques, gives added vigor to procedural and administrative acts for more speedy and just administration of justice.\n147.\tBut we did not stop there. The Republic of Bolivar and Sucre was living under the ancient codes of the Napoleonic law proclaimed by Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz, whose name they bear. But in a spirit of juridical renaissance, President Banzer has just prepared the new books of law in Bolivia that will enable him to remain in office as a wise and intelligent leader.\n148.\tAnother problem that we tackled with decision and courage, as well as with probity and patriotism, is that, of the reopening of the universities. The new statute of the Bolivian university was received with obvious enthusiasm, and it returns to the university its specific function to promote cultural growth and education. Without in any way impinging on the university's autonomy, in the true revolutionary and humanistic sense, but on the other hand, defending its authority and its right to disseminate ideas, the universities have resumed their specific activities in an atmosphere of security and with guarantees for all those who come to the classrooms with the sincere intention of receiving training in the arts and letters, in science and in technical fields. It is with great satisfaction that I can declare that we have restored to the university its high standing, and we are sure that, after the experience acquired in the recent past when it was turned into a terrorist arsenal and a laboratory for nefarious subversive practices, such shameful and criminal acts will never recur.\n149.\tI want clearly to state to this world-wide gathering, where the fate of man on earth is at issue, that in Bolivia we have the widest freedom of opinion. No one is persecuted for his ideas. Human intelligence is not imprisoned in dogmatic cells or sectarian molds. We prefer to run the risk of freedom of expression, the source of culture and the cradle of mankind's growing civilization. We firmly believe that economic and social development must be agreed to and shared and not the result of imposed decisions. Those who suffered sanctions did so not because they disagreed with the Government or because they professed one doctrine or another, but because of the degree of danger that they represented to the life of the nation.\n150.\tThanks to the moral authority with which the Government is now acting, and its determination to defend peace and fraternity among Bolivians, my country has taken a stride forward in the material achievements leading to economic development.\n151.\tHere we might mention the completion of the oil pipeline that carries 150 million cubic feet of gas a day from the eastern part of Bolivia to Argentina. Because of the chauvinistic demagogy of the previous Government, this work had been long held up and the national economy seriously damaged.\n152.\tIn the course of the year that has elapsed a number of estimates have been requested regarding wide-scale industrial projects, such as the oil plant in Villamontes, in the Department of Tarija, which calls for the sizable investment of $12 million.\n153.\tAnother project under way is the construction of silos for grains that has recently been signed in the city of Santa Cruz with a very important and trustworthy Colombian firm. And thus our agricultural workers will have a modern system of storage for their products and enjoy better marketing conditions.\n154.\tWe might also mention the volatilization plant that has been established in order to improve the grade of our minerals for export; this has been done with the efficient co-operation of the Soviet Union. The smelting plant of Vinto has been expanded with the technical and financial assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany. This will be a true liberation from the economic dependency which was keeping us in the position of a country that only produced raw materials.\n155.\tQuite apart from all this is the highway from Cochabamba to Villa Tunari and from Puerto Villarroel to Puerto Patino, roads known as 1 and 4, which, from primitive roads to the fertile area of the Chapare, have been converted into first-class paved roads. I am sure that they will very soon be a powerful factor in helping to promote national integration.\n156.\tThe Abapo-Izozog project, designed immediately to irrigate 300,000 hectares, with this figure being raised soon to 2 million, has also been provided with considerable finances. Once this irrigation project is concluded, Bolivia will export products of the land and we shall carry out great settlement work and shall have sufficient foodstuffs. This will save currency, today being spent in the amount of $40 million a year, for the purchase of food.\n157.\tHospitals, new roads linking zones and provinces that are today far removed from progress and the productive activity of the nation, public works of local progress, exploration of underground waters in the plateau for the purpose of irrigation, freezing plants, highways, mining camps and settlements, schools, the draining of rivers, national and international airports such as that of Viru-Viru, with an investment of more than $16 million, city halls, the paving of cities, the urbanization of rural areas these and many other works very difficult to list in a speech of this nature reflect the beneficent and progressive work of the State at present.\n158.\tI should like to give a brief outline of the important and significant contribution of private enterprise to the creative efforts of the Government. It has not been alien to the great changes going on. Indeed, it has shown great social awareness as well as a great sense of historic and patriotic responsibility. Without the assistance of private enterprise, it is obvious that national progress would limp along and would be unilateral and it would not be in keeping with a society that belongs to the Western world by its philosophy and its fundamental structures. In the area of cotton alone, despite difficult climatic and other conditions and adverse circumstances, employment and the volume exported this year lived up to what had been planned in March.\n159.\tWe have increased capital and reinvestment as announced by the national bank and foreign banks, which provided financing in the amount of $12 million to the Mining Corporation of Bolivia, which is in charge of the nationalized mines.\n160.\tEighty-two new large, medium, and small industries have been set up in my country. The National Institute of Investments is at present weighing 48 new projects with a total investment of $35 million. It is an organ to encourage new fields which offer opportunities for foreign capital and to guarantee its flow to the country.\n161.\tThe spontaneous contribution of private industry of 10 per cent of its profits for the encouragement of new projects in a few months has provided considerable amounts of capital. The interest of investors from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and other countries has been awakened, and we have thus set up bi-national companies for the development of certain industrial projects.\n162.\tThese and other initiatives of the private sector in such a short time are already eloquent proof of the confidence that has been awakened in the minds of investors by the popular and nationalist regime directed by Colonel Banzer, with its sights set squarely on a great future for the Americas and the world.\n163.\tAs my Government has carried out intensive work to ensure harmony in the Bolivian family and also to encourage development, we have not overlooked projecting Bolivia's image to the outside world. The President of the Bolivian people has made State visits to the leaders of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. At these interviews, which went beyond mere formalities, the most important aspects of bilateral relations were studied. Principles of an international nature were reaffirmed. Future action was projected, both in regional and subregional relations and with regard to our contribution to the maintenance of peace and the settlement of the grave problems that endanger our civilization.\n164.\tThese bilateral relations at all diplomatic levels have been established with our continental and geographical neighbors. We do not carry out a policy of preferences but one of harmony, complementing the economies of the other Latin American countries. Thus, with Peru last year we submitted to the Inter-American Development Bank a request for credits to finance the paved road between Ilo and La Paz. With the Buenos Aires Government we agreed to carry on the construction of the road that links Bermejo with Tarija and Potosi. With the nationalist administration of Paraguay, led by General Alfredo Stroessner, we have agreed on the necessity of immediately completing the trans-Chaco road and linking it with the Bolivian roads of Santa Cruz and Sucre, which would bring the Pan-American highway and the marginal road of the forests to the capital of Asuncion, which presided over the task of opening up and settling the Rio de la Plata region in colonial times. At the same time, we have been pursuing a similar policy with Brazil, the country of Pedro II, Rio Branco and Ruy Barbosa. With that Government, we have planned to link up the eastern network of Bolivia with the western network, thereby joining Santa Cruz de la Sierra with the terminal point of the railroad of Cochabamba. This is an important undertaking for Bolivians, on which we base our policy of national unity and also our policy of promoting our development, a task that cannot be postponed any longer. Similarly, an undertaking of continental significance is the linking of our countries and also the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is an undertaking that has its important and transcendental counterpart in the railroad going from Santa Cruz to Trinidad in the north, which was carried out by Argentina and which will link the plateau with the Amazon, thus bringing a fertile land into international trade and joining peoples in the common task of working together for the future of the Americas.\n165.\tYes, Bolivia located in the very heart of South America, will be criss-crossed by international traffic in the future and will provide shorter routes from the Strait of Magellan and the Panama Canal for certain countries.\n166.\tThat is our function today and our destiny. We are the bridge between the coastal countries of our hemisphere, bringing new benefits to mankind. To fulfill this function and destiny, we count on the enlightened understanding of our neighbors and the forthright co-operation of their distinguished leaders.\n167.\tThe visit to Bolivia of the Foreign Minister of Colombia, Mr. Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, opened up a new stage in the relations between my country and the country of Santander, whose armies covered themselves with glory in Junin and Ayacucho, consolidating the independence of upper Peru. That visit led to the creation of a joint commission to study trade relations between the two nations. There is also the forthcoming trip of the Foreign Minister of Ecuador, Mr. Lucio Paredes, to my country, which will link even more closely the peoples that saw the fame of Sucre in Pichincha and Potosi.\n168.\tA separate subject is the foreign policy of Bolivia vis-a-vis Chile. This year, in accordance with what was stated by me last year[1957th meeting], we have started an open dialog with representatives of the Government of the Palace of La Moneda by the establishment of a joint committee. It is by directly studying the factors of integration that Chile and Bolivia can unite, over and above whatever differences we may have, so that we may arrive at a policy of understanding. There are no insoluble problems or insurmountable differences. Reason, which persuades men and peoples, can lead us to modern and constructive ideas. Security does not lie in our own capacity to commit aggression or to defend ourselves, but in joining our efforts with those of others and putting together the resources we have. For all those reasons, I wish to express my hope here that through sound integrationist reasoning, within the framework of the Andean Pact, Bolivia and Chile will find a way to unite and build a better tomorrow.\n169.\tIn times like these, characterized by the principle of universality, there can be no partisan or exclusionary positions. The La Paz Government, convinced of this, is cultivating relations with all those countries that express a desire therefor. We are closely tied diplomatically and commercially to the members of the capitalist as well as the socialist communities. A number of cultural agreements and agreements of technical assistance and scientific cooperation and exchange are eloquent proof of this and they represent what we trust is a far-sighted policy.\n170.\tThis conduct in no way jeopardizes our doctrines. Today the peoples of the world cannot ignore one another for we all need one another. Man has awakened to a new era in which he has decided to improve his future and widen his sphere of action in the universe. But to do this the combined efforts of all nations are necessary. The struggle to conquer outer space has confronted ih with a new reality, and that is that our limited frontiers are narrow and egotistical. We can no longer say that our State is ours and concerns us alone. The commitment not to interfere in the affairs of other countries become today more understandable and categorical. We trust that all Governments will act accordingly and thus ensure fraternity throughout the world.\n171.\tIn keeping with this universalist philosophy I must infer specifically to the relations which Bolivia would hope to establish with the prodigious constellations of countries of Africa that victoriously have entered the international community. It is an ancient world which appears new, a continent pillaged for centuries that is now emerging to civilization and culture with the formidable talent of a race that is equal to any and which in a very short time has given proof of such creative capacity. The African nations are beginning to be heard when great historic decisions are made and their importance will continue to increase. Therefore it is our duty to offer them cordial and fruitful ties of friendship.\n172.\tFrom this experience to which I have referred so briefly my Government has arrived at a very favorable conclusion as to the meaning of this international Organization. Its deficiencies are doubtless many. It may well be that it lacks sufficient decision-making power. But it is a positive fact that it exists and that in its short existence it has fostered the birth of many nations.\n173.\tThis fully justifies the existence of the United Nations. It is an Organization that can not only bring together almost all of the nations of the world but constantly create new States in the everlasting struggle against colonialism It is a living, dynamic organization, in keeping with the aspirations and the desires of the peoples. The harmonization of the widely differing interests of Member States is indeed a complex undertaking. These are sovereign wills that should try to act in concert to maintain peace, but we must have faith that full knowledge of the risks of a modern war will permit the United Nations to strengthen itself as a universal parliament in which nations compare their interests and try to find harmonious positions in the interests of civilization.\n174.\tBolivia was represented at the meetings of the third session of UNCTAD, at the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Lima, which preceded them and at the meetings of the non-aligned countries, to which we brought our sincere aspiration for political plurality in international relations, mutual respect and friendship for all the nations of the world and indefatigable defense of the self-determination of peoples and the rejection of any form of dependence.\n175.\tMy country believes that we have fully carried out our obligations as a Member of the United Nations, because our presence in this building is a consequence not of fleeting circumstances but of profound democratic conviction.\n176.\tWe believe that the Charter is a basic document for peace among peoples and for the rule of social justice, without hegemonies, without exclusive sectarianism, without unfounded privileges and based only on the law. If all the Members of this great conclave of nations were to proclaim our faith in the Charter, if we were all to combine to comply with the terms of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I believe that mankind would have gone far towards the achievement of permanent peace. Unfortunately that is not the case. We are still living in a dangerous period of armed peace, a peace based more on fear than on love.\n177.\tWe have the Charter and we recognize that it is a most valuable instrument of understanding and harmony, but we lack the decision and the sincerity to comply with it in all its aspects instead of just when it is in line with our interests. The Charter must not become a mere expression of hope or of an unattainable Utopia. But that will depend not so much on the smaller nations as on those that have the resources of power; it will depend on the great Powers.\n178.\tMy country, together with all the other countries of Latin America, has subscribed to and ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  We, the Latin American nations, are still on the threshold of the atomic era. To a great extent that might appear to be one more disadvantage that separates us from the developed countries, but if we consider the substance of the problem we must agree that it is instead an advantage. We hope for and desire reactors and laboratories where we can take advantage of this marvelous source of energy for peaceful purposes while still preserving our geographical area from nuclear pollution. In this connexion our position is firm and determined and we supported Peru and other countries which expressed their justifiable fears a short while ago when France exploded nuclear devices over the Pacific.\n179.\tSo far the Protocol to the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been acceded to only by the United States of America and the United Kingdom. My Government considers that the Latin American aspiration to isolate our geographical area from the dangers of radiation is perfectly justifiable. Therefore I would remind those countries which have added nuclear weapons to their arsenals that Latin America fervently desires to see the Treaty of Tlatelolco strengthened by the firm adherence of others.\n180.\tOn the initiative of Ceylon and the United Republic of Tanzania the General Assembly last year declared the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. My delegation believes that this felicitous idea should be applied to other seas and continents which have so far been spared the dangers of war. In this .way we should be preserving geographical sectors, and would thus be able to isolate areas of conflict so as to eliminate the germs that generate danger.\n181.\tLatin America, which gave proof of its peaceful spirit with the Treaty of Tlatelolco, would be very interested in a similar declaration regarding the Indo-American area.\n182.\tThe history of the world could well be summed up in one phrase: man's struggle for freedom; for without freedom there is no dignity, since in indigence man can only be humiliated and not free. Man has always struggled for this inalienable right, which is just as much part of his vital needs as air, or bread, or water, and he has done so devotedly. As Jesus exalted the most humble and preached equality among men, so my country rebelled against the authoritarian Powers and liberated itself from a slavery which it could not bear. Thus we follow with great interest the process of independence in which many peoples of the world are involved. We are aware that misery and oppression spawn rebellion, but we consider rebellion to be the last stage in justified protest. If the dikes of prudence and fear are shattered and man engages in a heroic undertaking against his oppressors, he must meet them face to face. The struggle against misery is always unequal as far as means are concerned, but it is usually impelled by an ideal and the powerful stimulus that is given by the knowledge that the fight is in a just cause.\n183.\tBut terrorism is not that. When you struggle for the rule of justice in the world it is neither lawful nor human nor acceptable, nor even tolerable, to compensate for the hunger for change by the sacrifice of innocent victims who have nothing to do with the maintenance of the situation that is being fought against. The greed for power very often hides in the most extreme tendencies. It seeks supporters among the disgruntled. Psychology is made to serve politics and becomes a very powerful weapon.\n184.\tIn this international parliament I must speak sincerely and with vehemence against the use of these practices, which are an affront to our civilization. Today more than ever before the oppressed people have a rostrum here from which to denounce their oppressors. Each year, at each Assembly, we hear denunciations of abuses by the strong against the weak.\n185.\tThis means that the peoples which struggle are not without means. The international community has not turned a deaf ear to their cries. Furthermore, there are always institutions, peoples and individuals ready to assist them to achieve the justice to which they aspire and are entitled. Therefore, we cannot complacently watch acts of insanity such as those that recently shocked the world, because the victims were not those who caused the sufferings but were merely the victims of an outpouring of irresponsible hatred.\n186.\tMy Government believes that the United Nations should put an end to this new type of violence, particularly because it is premeditated, evil and destructive; it seeks its victims among those who have nothing to do with the problem, as though cruelty wished to drink the blood not only of its chosen victims, but also of humanity as a whole.\n187.\tI should like now to refer to the fight against pollution. At the recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, this problem was debated at length; but the problem calls also for some comments from us. We must recognize right away that the concern must be shared by all men. Its significance could be compared to the concern of an astronaut on this spaceship which we call earth. He, too, must worry about his environment, means of life and safety during this extraordinary adventure of life.\n188.\tWe agree with principle 20 of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. It is quite in keeping with the Declaration of Asuncion, approved on 3 June 1971 at the Fourth Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Plata Basin. In the matter of the utilization of international waters, the up-river countries must do whatever is necessary to meet their needs, with the sole condition of not causing tangible damage to the nations down-river. This principle, added to the principle of not changing the river bed from one geographical basin to another is a doctrinal concept that Bolivia has consistently supported, in keeping with universal principles of law and reason.\n189.\tAlthough there is a general trend today not to accept the creation of new international organs because of the burden they represent for Member States, we believe that the case for creating a small body to study the human environment is one worthy of applause. The suggestion by the United States has the widest support of my delegation since it fills a felt need.\n190.\tOne final comment. With reference to the question of pollution, it is only natural that this \\\"phenomenon alarms those countries suffering from it. We are speaking of the highly industrialized nations. But it is for us to tell then; that in the young and still unexplored continents of African and America there is sufficient green space, the necessary oxygen and it is neither rare nor contaminated. In our opulent land can be built new industries without endangering human health. Those industries, in the process of industrial de-concentration and promoting the development of the backward countries, could strengthen their economies and lessen the degree of their dependence.\n191.\tThis does not mean that we are unaware of the situation of the countries and cities which suffer from the pollution of their environment. We are at one with them in their search for adequate solutions.\n192.\tFrom the very moment when, on the initiative of Malta, the question of the sea-bed and the ocean floor was raised in the United Nations, Bolivia has taken a great interest in that question. We were elected a member of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and our representatives have contributed greatly to clarifying the problems of land-locked countries as far as the sea is concerned.\n193.\tThis concern over the questions of the sea by a country which has no coast is neither paradoxical nor extraordinary. Bolivia, together with the other land-locked countries, has a direct, immediate and urgent interest in anything that deals with the oceans of the world.\n194.\tOur participation in the clarification of those problems will not for obvious reasons which we consider circumstantial at the moment-be extended to questions relating to the width of the territorial sea, the continental shelf, fishing or international straits, on which we lack experience. We will therefore limit our discussion to the questions of land-locked countries, their consequences and possible solutions.\n195.\tThe process of elaborating principles in the legal field is now under way. The recognition of the sea as belonging to mankind is a positive fact. That means that the wealth of the sea-bed is the common heritage of mankind.\n196.\tWe must note that the practical application of those truths is very unequal and, in some cases, non-existent. Although the land-locked countries were ignored in the past, since the Barcelona Agreement and the Geneva Conference of 1958 the international community has turned its attention to the problems confronted by the land-locked countries. We must recognize, however, that the principles thus far approved are deficient. We must, without referring to the specific condition of each landlocked country, recognize the general nature of the right of all countries to benefit from the use of the wealth drawn from the oceans and the rivers; otherwise the universality of the sea would be purely nominal so far as the land-locked countries are concerned and their possibility of utilizing the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor would be illusory.\n197.\tNaturally, in the exercise of those rights in one case as well as in another, there must be different characteristics and features, and their legal formulation is the second point that must be considered by the General Assembly and the sea-bed Committee.\n198.\tSome of these concepts have already been included in the topics and issues to be dealt with at the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at the plenipotentiary level. We have contributed drafts and amendments which, fortunately, to a large extent were accepted at the Geneva meetings. We expect to put forth those same concepts in this Assembly in the forthcoming meetings of the sea-bed Committee and particularly at the conference of plenipotentiaries in 1973, whose convening we support.\n199.\tOnly a few more words, addressed particularly to my colleagues the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the permanent representatives of the other land-locked nations. My Government considers it right and proper that, in the course of the present year and prior to the holding of the conference of plenipotentiaries, the land-locked countries meet to study joint formulations which while improving their depressing geographical situation are acceptable to the coastal States. We know that there are various regional realities which require different approaches; but we must recognize that they must be in keeping with certain principles of universal validity. Therefore, my Government intends to act systematically and to make the necessary efforts to make possible the conference of the land-locked countries. In due course we will hold the necessary consultations.\n200.\tIn the meantime, we want to draw attention to the two resolutions approved at Santiago during the third session of UNCTAD.  They place a singular responsibility on the land-locked countries to ensure implementation. The first refers to the danger to the under-developed countries of the exploitation of minerals on the sea-bed; and the second warns the industrialized nations that no claims based on past, present or future activities over any part of the zone or its resources will be entertained, and appeals to those States which have made such claims to refrain from doing so until an international regime governing exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor has been established.\n201.\tLand is a universal common asset; and, therefore, it is natural and logical that the sea and its wealth also be considered the general heritage of mankind, to be used for the benefit of all nations. This same general idea relates to what we said last year in our statement concerning the economic equality of States, in keeping with the principle of their legal and sovereign equality. We must say the same regarding the Mexican proposal made during the third session of UNCTAD for the drafting of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States. The daring idea of collective economic security put forward by the Brazilian delegation [2038th meeting] is in keeping with the same idea. By studying these ideas and discerning these fraternal purposes, we are led to believe that mankind is heading towards a future of peace and wider international justice. Success in mankind's earnest efforts for a better future depends, in the last analysis, on the determination of the great Powers and on the understanding their leaders show in assisting the development of the less favored nations of the world.\n"

The unanimous support for your election to this high office reflects the great respect and appreciation which the world community has for your people, your country and your eminent self.\n79.\tWe would also express profound appreciation for the constructive efforts which your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, exerted with ideal objectivity and which produced significant contributions to the positive achievements of the world Organization.\n80.\tWe congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim on his election to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations and wish him full success in discharging the onerous duties of his office with impartiality and effectiveness.\n81.\tWhile we welcome the new Secretary-General, it behooves us to express well-deserved appreciation for the work of his predecessor, U Thant, who directed the affairs of the United Nations through most critical and stormy phases. We shall remember with respect and appreciation the work and the personality of that worthy son of Asia.\n82.\tEvery year we stop for a while to review and assess the work of the world community. If we assess the achievements of last year objectively and realistically we find that international relations have made little progress in promoting the freedom, security and welfare of the large majority of the peoples of the world. For, despite important developments aimed at reducing points of international confrontation, the majority of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America feel that their integrity continues to be endangered, their freedom constrained and their dignity infringed upon and that they are still exposed to the worst forms of exploitation.\n83.\tThese peoples welcome the elimination of points of tension that involved dangers to the very existence of the human race. They are also gratified at the wider acceptance of the concept of peaceful coexistence. But it is also their ardent desire that the beneficial results of the new developments should extend to the peoples of the world, regardless of their size and power.\n84.\tIn this respect the Syrian Arab Republic considers the proposed conference on European security a commendable step towards establishing security in a region which, like our country, borders on the Mediterranean. The Syrian Arab Republic has therefore expressed full support for the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 and the treaties concluded between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany on 12 August 1970, on the one hand, and between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany on 7 December 1970, on the other.\n85.\tWhile welcoming the proposal for the holding of a European security conference, we would point out the inseparable connexion existing between security in Europe and security in the Mediterranean basin. The geographical situation of many European countries and the interaction between the interests of European countries and those of countries bordering on the Mediterranean make any arrangement for European security that neglects the security of the Mediterranean countries quite futile. And there can be neither peace nor security in the Mediterranean region unless an end is put to the continued Israeli aggression by ensuring the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories and by restoring to the Arab people of Palestine their usurped rights.\n86.\tAnother significant development is the proposal calling for the convening of a world disarmament conference. As a developing non-aligned State, we fully support all international efforts aimed at complete and comprehensive disarmament that would free the world from its fear of a nuclear war by destroying existing nuclear stockpiles, prohibiting further production of nuclear weapons and establishing effective international control to see to it that these goals are fully implemented.\n87.\tWe are not unaware of the hopeful vistas that have been gained through these welcome developments, but we cannot overlook the oppressive conditions from which peoples of the third world continue to suffer. The Israeli aggression is continuing. With the passing of time, its dangers and the miseries it brings are ever on the increase. The peoples of IndoChina continue to suffer from the imperialistic United States aggression, while extensive parts of Africa continue to be subjected to direct colonialism and to the abominable practices of racial discrimination, involving, as they do, acts of plunder, exploitation and complete disregard for human rights.\n88.\tDespite the efforts exerted by the developing countries, the gap between developing and developed nations in the economic, cultural, scientific and technical fields is constantly becoming wider. This is an inevitable result of the increasing inequality between the two groups of nations and of the pressure exerted from the outside on the peoples of the third world, which aspire to taking determined steps along the path of progress and equality and to making an effective contribution to the noble aim of ensuring a decent life to all human beings without distinction as to race, color or creed.\n89.\tAn analysis of the prevailing international conditions would demonstrate that the system of international relations set up after the destruction of Nazi despotism has not proved a success, notwithstanding the terrible sufferings of the Second World War and the lessons humanity should have learned from them regarding the need to uphold the objectives and principles we have all agreed to respect in order to ensure a better life for all peoples. True, the balance of nuclear terror has so far protected us from total and sure destruction. But, in spite of its effectiveness in preventing a total war, it has produced little effect with regard to barring of the use or threat of force in international relations. Moreover, it has had no effect whatsoever on the inequality prevailing between the developed and the developing countries. Many peoples therefore continue to suffer from enslavement, exploitation, occupation and persecution a fact which reveals the extent to which we have failed to achieve the lofty aims of the Charter. In view of this regrettable and dangerous situation the Syrian Arab Republic continues to consider it a sacred duty to share in the pursuance of the struggle against the oppressive conditions that threaten world peace and violate the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n90.\tIndeed, the Syrian Arab Republic is struggling alongside those peoples fighting to ensure for humanity a future free from aggression, domination, oppression, fear, hunger and ignorance. Our country's determined opposition to new and old colonialism has entailed for us a great deal of suffering and sacrifice. As all members know, Syria has been and continues to be the victim of aggression, occupation and all kinds of threats and pressure. But we shall not budge from our position of unshakable determination to liberate our land and to fight imperialism and colonialism. We shall continue to maintain this position until the cause we defend is vindicated through the struggle of the peoples of the world to achieve for humanity freedom and a peace based on justice and equity.\n91.\tIn consonance with the principles we uphold, we have firmly supported and shall continue to support the peoples of IndoChina, victims of United States imperialist aggression. We have supported the heroic struggle of the people of Viet-Nam to preserve their national unity and territorial integrity and to defend their right to determine their future freely and without foreign interference. We reiterate our belief that the seven-point plan put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam presents a constructive attitude to the solution of the VietNamese question.\n92.\tWe condemn the escalation of United States aggression against the people of Viet-Nam-the bombing of non- military targets, the deliberate destruction of economic establishments, dams and irrigation projects, and the wanton killing of civilians children, women and old men. The entire international community and the civilized world ask: Do not these acts constitute most hideous war crimes, directed against the whole of humanity?\n93.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic also condemns United States military interference in Cambodia and Laos. We believe that the Cambodian Government of National Union is the only legal representative of the people of Cambodia. We support the Joint Declaration of the Summit Conference of the IndoChinese Peoples, held in 1970, and believe that peace in IndoChina can be achieved only through the withdrawal of foreign troops and the exercise by the peoples of IndoChina of their right to self-determination without outside hindrance or interference.\n94.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic supports the new initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the peaceful unification of Korea. We call for the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the closing down of the United Nations Command in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea's territory.\n95.\tIn perpetrating their crimes against the peoples of Africa, the colonialists and imperialists have resorted to all the methods of old and new colonialism, including settler colonialism and the imposition of a terrible form of racial discrimination in support of foreign minority regimes which have been exploiting and plundering extensive areas of the African continent.\n96.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic declares its full and complete solidarity with the African peoples struggling to end colonial domination. We also support the decisions taken at the ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]5 aimed at putting an end to colonialism in Africa in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.\n97.\tThe Syrian Arab people strongly condemn the policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of South Africa. We also condemn the insistence of that Government on occupying and administering Namibia. We express full support for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe against the despotic and oppressive rule of an exploiting racist minority. We strongly support all liberation movements in Africa, and particularly those of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).\n98.\tThe Arab people, which has been plagued by Zionist aggression based on settler colonialism and racial discrimination and by expansionist attacks in the Arabian Gulf, regards the peoples of Africa, who are victims of imperialism and colonialism, as comrade struggler against a common enemy that follows the same methods and uses the same weapons to uproot the native inhabitants, replace them by racist immigrants, impose on them political and economic domination, and usurp and exploit the natural resources of their lands. The Arab people of Syria is determined to continue the common struggle alongside the peoples of Africa until final victory is achieved and the last bastion of imperialism in Africa is completely destroyed.\n99.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic an early member of the non-aligned movement believes that the principles first formulated at the Asian-African Conference held at Bandung 17 years ago  have affirmed, despite imperialist plots, the will of the peoples of the third world to achieve liberation and build up a future for humanity in which peace and security prevail.\n100.\tWe regard the Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, which was held at Georgetown, Guyana, from 8 to 11 August 1972, as a step forward in the struggle of the non-aligned States to ensure a victory for liberation movements throughout the world over all forms of imperialism, colonialism and racial discrimination. The resolutions of the Conference supporting the struggle of the Arab people against Israeli aggression and occupation, condemning the crimes of kidnapping and international piracy committed by the Israelis against Syria and Lebanon, expressing support for the struggle of the Arab people of Palestine to regain their national right to their lands and homeland and their right to self-determination, and supporting the struggle of the peoples of IndoChina and the liberation movements in Africa and all parts of the world, have confirmed the force and independence of the non- aligned movement and its ability to withstand all forms of imperialist pressure. We are determined to continue the struggle to ensure the triumph of the principles of non-alignment, regardless of the sacrifices involved.\n101.\tIn this connexion, I wish to second and support the very sound suggestion put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico [2050th meeting], rightly claiming a permanent presence of countries of the third world in the Security Council.\n102.\tWe have always advocated universality of representation in the United Nations and all its agencies. During the past year all of us have noticed the positive changes in the work of the world Organization resulting from China's regaining its seat in the United Nations. China has supported the peoples of the third world and is in the first rank of the States committed to the liquidation of colonialism and imperialism. It has worked sincerely and hard to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n103.\tWe support the admission of all peace-loving States which respect the Charter to membership in the world Organization and believe that the admission of the German\nDemocratic Republic to membership in the United Nations would strengthen the Organization and help to promote world peace.\n104.\tThe political independence of any country remains shaky unless it is accompanied by freedom from economic dependence. To achieve this freedom the developing countries should follow an economic policy conducive to raising the national income and consequently the standard of living of their citizens. The gap between developed and developing countries is widening, as demonstrated by the third session of UNCTAD, held this year at Santiago, Chile.\n105.\tWe agree that developing countries should follow the path of self-reliance, initiate development projects and make efforts to increase the volume of trade exchange among themselves. On the other hand, developed countries should respond not only to the dictates of solidarity and historic responsibilities but to their real interests as well, and the interests of world peace and humanity in general, by taking the steps needed to create the political will to adjust international economic relations in a manner which will ensure justice and equality, put an end to cases of flagrant injustice and gradually reduce the tremendous gap separating the standards of living of the developed and the developing countries.\n106.\tRealizing the great importance to the future of humanity of the topics of discussion at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm last June, the Syrian Arab Republic participated in the Conference and in the efforts that contributed to its positive results. It is to be hoped that the present session of the General Assembly will give the subject of the human environment the attention it fully deserves.\n107.\tThe Zionist-imperialist aggression against the Arab people of Palestine and three Arab countries which are Members of the United Nations is becoming more fierce and more flagrant, as well as more fraught with grave danger to the peace and security of the Middle East region and of the world.\n108.\tThe five years that have passed since the Israeli aggression of 5 June 1967 have revealed to United Nations Members and to all the peoples of the world the real nature of the aggression with which we are confronted.\n109.\tThe Middle East question, which is in fact an extension of the Palestine question, represents the gravest challenge to the United Nations and a most serious threat to world peace and security. The fate of the world Organization as a means of deterring the aggressor and eliminating aggression depends on its ability to ensure due respect for its resolutions and the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n110.\tAlthough recent years have witnessed a greater realization by United Nations Members of the danger to the international community as a whole resulting from Israel's expansionist policy and repeated acts of aggression, the gulf separating the wishes of the United Nations as manifested in United Nations resolutions on the one hand, and the ensuring of the requisite respect for and actual implementation of those resolutions on the other, has become wider than ever, with the result that small nations no longer consider the world Organization capable of furnishing an adequate guarantee of their independence and security and the integrity of their national territory.\n111.\tThis challenge to the authority of the United Nations and the contemptuous flouting of United Nations resolutions relating to matters of peace and security not only constitute a threat to the authority of the world Organization but also provide encouragement to covetous expansion and aggression in all parts of the world, as long as the aggressor may be permitted to enjoy the fruits of aggression without fear of either punishment or deterrence.\n112.\tFar from abiding by United Nations resolutions that condemn the use of force and the acquisition of territory through the use of force, Israel boasts arrogantly of retaining the fruits of its aggression of 1967, as it retained the fruits of its aggression of 1948.\n113.\tLast June, five years after the perpetration of the 1967 aggression, Israel announced the number, type and names of the Israeli settlements established in the occupied Arab territories and produced maps showing the location of those settlements. Seventeen settlements have been established in the Syrian Golan heights, as Israel itself has admitted, 17 on the west bank of the Jordan and 16 in the Gaza sector and the Sinai and Araba district. Israel, of course, did not announce the names and number of the Arab villages which have been bulldozed to make way for the establishment of those settlements; and no information has been given concerning the lands from which the Arab inhabitants have been evicted so that those lands can be given to immigrants coming from the four corners of the earth, after having been misled and deceived by the Zionist propaganda machine.\n114.\tIsrael is interested not in implementing United Nations resolutions but rather in implementing resolutions of the World Zionist Congress, of which every clause involves a violation of the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and resolutions adopted by the various United Nations organs relating to the Palestine question.\n115.\tThe resolutions of the twenty-eighth World Zionist Congress, which was held in occupied Jerusalem early this year, were more covetous and aggressive than those of former Congresses. They approved Israeli aggression and expansion, sanctioned denial of the human and national existence of the Arabs, mobilized Zionist resources for the colonization of Arab lands, and, with a spirit of racial and religious fanaticism, called on all Jews, wherever they happen to be and regardless of their political affiliations and of the regimes under which they happen to live, to emigrate to Palestine and the occupied Arab territories, and thereby participate in the crime of expelling the native inhabitants and obliterating the Arab heritage and civilization all this in order to help fulfill the mad dream of a \\\"Greater Israel\\\" extending from the Nile to the Euphrates.\n116.\tAt a time when Israel refuses to repatriate the Arab refugees and displaced persons to the lands from which they were expelled and which lie so close to their place of exile, the World Zionist Congress expressed deep gratification at the accelerated rate of immigrants pouring into Israel from all parts of the world, called for a continued effort to stimulate the emigration of Jews from all countries and regimes, and declared that the right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel is beyond dispute.\n117.\tThis attitude, which derives from arrogance, selfishness and defiance, shows the true nature of Zionism and its offshoot, Israel. Between 1949 and 1971 the United Nations General Assembly adopted 24 resolutions confirming the Palestinian refugees' right to repatriation. Also, since 1967 United Nations resolutions have been adopted confirming Security Council resolution 237 (1967), which was adopted unanimously on 14 June 1967, and calling on Israel to repatriate the refugees displaced since 5 June 1967. Notwithstanding all these United Nations resolutions clearly upholding Arab rights over Arab lands, the Zionist newcomers persist in claiming that their right to these lands is indisputable.\n118.\tSuch is the logic of brute force which has again exposed to this Assembly and to the whole world the nature of the Zionist-Israeli aggressors, against whom our people, who aspire to liberation and peace, are obliged to struggle.\n119.\tIsrael's record abounds in war crimes and crimes against humanity-crimes which were defined by the Nuremberg principle,  that definition being later adopted by the United Nations [resolution 95(1)]. It is, indeed, ironical that Israel has violated every principle and article of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949-a Convention originally drafted to prevent a repetition of the crime committed by Nazi brutality against the peoples of Europe, and particularly against Jews.\n120.\tThe destruction of Arab towns and villages, the changing of the Arab character of the occupied territories, the expulsion of their inhabitants, the imposition of collective punishments, the confiscation of Arab property, and the collective transfer of the Arab inhabitants to distant areas or to areas outside the occupied territories in order to have them replaced by new Jewish immigrants-who are avowedly settler colonialists all this constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and of the most elementary human rights and principles. The entire matter has been summed up by Moshe Day an, an acknowledged expert in violence and terrorism, in his comment that \\\"no Jewish settlement has been built on land other than that on which an Arab village had stood\\\". That was reported in Ha'Aretz on 19 March 1969. Confronted with these Israeli crimes, the Commission on Human Rights declared at its last session that Israeli acts in the occupied territories constitute war crimes and a challenge to humanity. \n121.\tIsrael has raised much clamor in the world concerning the alleged inhuman treatment of Syrian Jews by Syria. Israel seems to believe that the world is deaf, dumb and blind, and therefore cannot see or hear of the racial discrimination to which the Arabs in Palestine and other occupied territories are subjected and which is also being practiced against colored and Oriental Jews. But Syria, with a good conscience, has always welcomed representatives of the world press, who have reported on the perfect equality which all Syrians enjoy, without any form of discrimination.\n122.\tAs a result of United States support reaching the point of abdication by the United States of its own personality the Israelis have assumed a degree of arrogance that makes them maintain an attitude of complete indifference to the world-wide condemnation of Nazi-like methods and mentality, to which the Jews fell victim in the past and which are now applied by Israel, not only against the Arabs, but also against certain categories of Jews who are treated as second-class citizens.\n123.\tThe entire world has heard of the desecration by Israel of churches and mosques in occupied Palestine. The attempt to burn down the Al Aqsa Mosque in 1969 was not the work of a mentally deranged person, as claimed by Israel. The attempt was repeated this year, but a strict black-out has been imposed by the Israeli authorities on reports relating to it. The whole world has heard, also, of the attempts to desecrate religious places and to plunder antiquities in the occupied Arab territories. Most recently, the conscience of humanity was shocked at the action of the Israeli authorities when the inhabitants of the Arab villages of Iqrit and Kefar Bar'am were prevented by force of arms from returning to their lands and villages, 24 years after they had been expelled from them by the Israelis.\n124.\tThe whole world, moreover, has heard of the destruction, demolishing and bulldozing of Arab villages in the Jerusalem and Hebron districts under one pretext or another. Israel's policy of terrorizing the peaceful Arab inhabitants, which began with the massacres of Deir Yasin and Qibya 1948 and 1953 has been continued because the Israelis find it effective and are, furthermore, indifferent to its repercussions on world public opinion, as they believe they can deal with such repercussions through their deceitful propaganda machine and through resort to the blackmailing trick of accusing any State which fails to be deceived or misled by this machine of the heinous crime of anti-Semitism. Thus the anti-Semitic slander has been turned by Israel and Zionism into a blackmailing device with which to stifle all criticism of their policies and objectives and to victimize any individual, State or institution that does not acquiesce in their plans and maneuvers.\n125.\tTo justify their 1967 war of aggression, Israel's leaders used to pretend that the war was launched by them because the Arabs were threatening the very existence of Israel. A few weeks ago, however, Israeli generals declared that neither in 1967 nor at any earlier time was the existence of Israel in danger and that the pretense of the existence of such a danger had been resorted to in order to provide a pretext for a prearranged and carefully planned war of aggression against the Arab countries. To such limits have Israel's addiction to force and violence and its contempt for world public opinion reached.\n126.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic wishes to draw the attention of the General Assembly to Israel's refusal to respond to provisions of Security Council resolutions 316 (1972) and 317 (1972), calling on Israel to release the Syrian and Lebanese military personnel kidnapped inside Lebanese territory. This kidnapping crime by Israel not only is an act of piracy, but also constitutes a violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 which bar the holding of hostages. Israel is clearly holding the kidnapped Syrian officers as hostages, as is evident from the Israeli proposal that they be exchanged for Israeli prisoners of war captured while taking part in military operations against the Arab countries.\n127.\tIsrael's failure to abide by provisions of those Security Council resolutions violates the United Nations Charter. The General Assembly should therefore take measures leading to the unconditional release of the Syrian and Lebanese officers and military personnel.\n128.\tThe worsening situation in the Middle East and the threat to world peace and security involved therein are entirely Israel's responsibility. For Israel persists in carrying out expansionist plans and in depriving the Arab people of Palestine of their national rights. The United States, which has used its material, military, political, scientific and technical potential to protect the Israeli aggressor against the Arab countries, shares in the responsibility.\n129.\tThe veto resorted to by the United States Government, for the second time in its history at the United Nations, against a Security Council draft resolution aimed at stopping Israeli aggression against Syria and Lebanon furnishes proof of United States backing for aggression. It also indicates that this great Power has abandoned its commitments under the United Nations Charter. The United States veto, which rendered the Security Council helpless against aggression, encouraged the aggressors to continue their challenge to the will of the world community and to launch a more extensive invasion of Lebanese territory on 16 and 17 September last. Following this, Israel further escalated that aggression by another against the Syrian Arab Republic.\n130.\tIn fact, the Middle East conflict is basically one between world Zionism, which invaded Palestine with imperialist and colonialist help, on the one hand, and the Arab people of Palestine, who were the victims of this invasion and who, having been driven out of their homeland, have been forced for over 25 years to lead a life of dispersion and deprivation, on the other hand. The United Nations General Assembly recognized this fact in resolutions adopted after the June 1967 Israeli aggression. In particular, these resolutions recognized that \\\"the problem of the Palestine Arab refugees has arisen from the denial of their inalienable rights under the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\\" [resolution 2535 B (XXIV)]. They also affirmed that \\\"the people of Palestine are entitled to equal rights and self-determination\\\" [resolution 2672 C (XXV)], and they expressed \\\"grave concern that the people of Palestine have not been permitted to enjoy their inalienable rights and to exercise their right to self-determination\\\", and declared that \\\"full respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an indispensable element in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East\\\" [resolution 2792 D (XXVI)].\n131.\tThe Middle East conflict acquired new dimensions following the Israeli aggression against three Arab countries in 1967 an aggression that represented a new phase in the Zionist-Israeli expansionist plans and constituted a grave threat to world peace and security.\n132.\tI affirm here that the attitude of the Syrian Arab Republic to the Palestine question and to the Zionist-imperialist aggression against our lands is firm and based on principles as well as on the provisions of the United Nations Charter, rules of international law, and the dictates of justice and equity. I also affirm that there are two prerequisites for the establishment of peace in the Middle East: first, recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to their land and homeland and to the free exercise of the right of self-determination and, secondly, the complete, immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories.\n133.\tPeace in which the aggressor is rewarded is not real peace. It is submission to the will of the aggressor and a yielding to conditions dictated through force. Contemporary European history has shown that peace which is not based on law and justice is a \\\"respite between two wars\\\". Rewarding the aggressor in order to secure peace is an invitation to war. We therefore strongly reject what are termed \\\"partial solutions\\\". These are deceptive efforts that confirm and perpetuate the consequences of aggression through a false hope of achieving a formal peace.\n134.\tIsrael and the imperialists who give Israeli aggression full support and backing are deluded if they believe that a policy of imposing faits accomplis by dint of force can result in stability and permanent peace, which will result not from force and aggression, but from freedom and justice.\n135.\tCertain well-known maneuvers and pressures have, in a particular set of circumstances, succeeded in getting included in the agenda of this session an item concerning measures to prevent terrorism [item 92]. It has been obvious from the start that the sources of these maneuvers and pressures wanted to provoke a debate in order to achieve certain political ends. The result was that opinion inclined to the necessity of investigating the causes behind the acts of violence. We welcome this outcome, and express the hope that the discussion will elicit conclusions consonant with the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter-first and foremost among them the right of peoples to liberty, self-determination and the preservation of human dignity.\n136.\tThe Syrian Arab Republic has always taken a stand against terrorism, whether by individuals or groups or States. Syria has not failed to record the principles it stands for in this connexion in documents of the United Nations and has never ceased to strive for these principles and for the establishment of an international society ordered by law and governed by justice, under a standard of peace.\n137.\tThe question confronting us is: What is terrorism and\nwho are the terrorists? To answer this question, we must go back to the Articles of the world Organization's Charter and there obtain guidance, for the most extreme forms of terror against which the world is protesting have been occasioned by the repudiation of this Charter and the principles of international law by certain international forces.\n138.\tThe United Nations Charter condemns colonialism and aggression, the use of force and the threat of force. Along with this we find that the imperialist forces and the States to which they pertain practice colonialism and aggression and intimidation and that their language is the language of bombing, slaughter, and genocide.\n139.\tThe world Organization's Charter confirms to all peoples the right of self-determination. Yet this principle is scorned by the forces of aggression, which pursue a course of domination and oppression to the point of divesting entire peoples of their lands and homeland.\n140.\tThe United Nations Charter postulates equality of all peoples, regardless of color, race or religion. Yet forces hostile to humanity and to the principles of justice and equality practice racial discrimination, elevating it to the rank of a policy and a philosophy.\n141.\tWhat, then, is real terrorism? Who are the real terrorists? Is the struggle of a people for freedom and sovereignty real terrorism? Or doc 3 terrorism really lie in acts of aggression and occupation? Are the actual terrorists those who are struggling to regain a freedom denied them and a homeland from which they have been driven? Or are they those who denied those peoples their freedom and expelled them from their homeland?\n142.\tUntil recently many of the heads of delegations and the representatives now gathered in this Assembly were being described by imperialists as \\\"terrorists\\\". The voices which define and exploit the term \\\"terrorism\\\" today are the same voices which but lately labeled the freedom leaders in Africa, Asia and Latin America \\\"terrorists\\\".\n143.\tAs we move back in history, we ask ourselves: Were not Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and George Washington in their time the leaders and commanders of terrorism in the view of the ruling colonial Power? Were not the heroes resisting Nazi and Fascist occupation in Europe \\\"terrorists\\\" in the eyes of the Nazi and Fascist leaders?\n144.\tIt is a highly strange and dubious occasion on which we see the representative of Israel stand before this General Assembly to discuss terrorism and measures to prevent it. How very incongruous that the representative of those institutions of murder and terrorism, the Hagana, the Stern gang, and Irgun Z'vai Leumi another name for Israel- should speak of terrorism. Who was it who murdered Count Bernadotte? Who perpetrated the massacres at Deir Yasin, at Qibya, Qalqiliya, and Tulkarm? Who were the ones who blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, burying innocent old people, women and children? Who was it who organized and executed the campaign of parcels containing explosives sent by post to Egypt, causing the death of scores of people? Who were the' heroes of the Lavon scandal? And who was Lavon, the main protagonist of this episode?\n145.\tWas not Lavon the Israeli Minister of Defense at that time, the Israeli Government's deputy in the crime, arranged by that Government, of slaughtering innocent people? The Lavon affair took place in 1954 in Egypt. It occasioned the death of many innocent, good people, the burning of the American library and the bombing of the American and British embassies in order to sabotage Egypt's relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. The Israeli newspapers at the time described this crime as savage and barbarous, before Lavon's agents, Dayan and Peretz, were unmasked.\n146.\tWhat do the Israeli leaders want, then, from this feverish campaign which has led them to say that the goal of peace now occupies second place in their concern? Do they not desire to prejudice public opinion against the Palestinian Arab entity and to gain the approval, even the participation, of a number of States in their conspiracy to put down the Palestinian resistance, preliminary to initiating effective operations against that entity? What they want, furthermore, is to divert the attention of world opinion from Israeli activity in occupied Palestine and other occupied Arab lands each day, every hour, minute by minute, actions of savagery and brutality, affronts to humanity, the extreme of terrorism.\n147.\tWe would alert and warn against this maneuver all those who abide by truth and the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is not aimed at the Palestinian liberation movement alone; it also threatens every national liberation movement in the world.\n148.\tWe are opposed to acts of violence which do not fall within the context of a legitimate struggle for liberating conquered territory, restoring the dignity and liberty of peoples, or protecting basic human rights. We do not believe patriotism is served by violence which destroys innocent souls. Yet we shall not be a party to exploiting an emotional act of desperation in order to block patriotic activity for liberation and suffocate in its cradle the legitimate struggle of peoples. We are firmly opposed to the massive terrorism for which States Members of this United Nations are responsible, as they practice oppression against peoples who are struggling for their freedom, sovereignty, national dignity, and the recovery of their lands.\n149.\tThe experience of the peoples of the world in the struggle for liberty and human dignity has taught them that injustice imposed on an oppressed people constitutes a serious threat to the dignity and security of all peoples.\n150.\tAggression and occupation maintained through killing, destruction, and religious and racial discrimination cannot suppress the aspirations of our peoples to freedom and liberation. Rather, they would strengthen their faith in man and in the dignity of man and their belief that a people's struggle even when confronted with destruction, occupation, and the concepts of racial and religious discrimination which the imperialists uphold will ultimately prevail. Those who are proud and intoxicated with their power to kill and destroy and with their success in aggression and occupation should remember that nazism, whose slogans and methods they imitate, has been crushed and destroyed, and that the Nazi leaders, at one time the gods of war and annihilation, ended up as criminals of war and the enemies of man.\n151.\tThose who persist in aggression, in flouting international laws and conventions and in violating human rights would do well to remember that history proves that right will ultimately be vindicated and that the will of peoples is invincible.\n"

        "file_text": "Comrade President, allow me first of all to congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of the most important international political forum, the General Assembly of the United Nations. The unanimity displayed in your election is a reflection of the respect which States Members of the United Nations have for the peace-loving policies of the Polish People's Republic and for you personally.\n39.\tWe should also like to congratulate the Secretary- General of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim. Although he has occupied the post of chief administrative officer of the United Nations for less than a year, he has already shown his desire to co-operate in ensuring that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance and strengthening of peace is enhanced and its activities in the solution of this main task under the United Nations Charter expanded.\n40.\tIt is logical and natural for sessions of the United Nations General Assembly to begin with a general political debate. Representatives of States Members of the United Nations assess the main international events, review the results of past United Nations activities in the light of the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter, and set definite tasks for the future. The political impetus which the United Nations receives during the general debate is helpful in the subsequent consideration of the items on the agenda.\n41.\tEven at last year's session of the General Assembly new trends were observed in relations among States which went some way towards meeting the desire of the peoples to secure lasting peace on the earth. Today there is reason to believe that these trends are growing stronger, although \nthe forces opposed to a relaxation of tension in the world have not ceased their activities.\n42.\tIn these circumstances the United Nations should make new efforts to promote the solution of acute international problems. As a Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, the Soviet Union will continue to make its contribution to the cause of the struggle for peace and the transformation of the United Nations into an even more effective instrument of peace.\n43.\tThe Soviet State will soon celebrate its fiftieth anniversary as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Leninist formula of the state unity of the peoples of the Soviet Union contains a powerful potential for peace- building. A profound interest in peace is organically inherent in the voluntary and equal union of socialist republic which have joined efforts in a constructive endeavor for the good of their peoples, and predatory wars and the oppression of other peoples are organically alien to such a union.\n44.\tFor the Soviet Union the policy of peace is an adequate reflection, in the sphere of .external relations, of its internal social nature. In the decisions of the Twenty- fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our country put forward a program of peace and international co-operation which, as is universally recognized, reflects not the narrow interests of any State or group of States but the aspirations of all peoples, of all mankind. Every step taken to implement it has a constructive influence on international development as a whole.\n45.\t\\\"Our policy of principle\\\", as Mr. L. I. Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, \\\"is the active defense of peace, freedom and the security of peoples. We are pursuing it together with our friends and allies, co-ordinating our steps in the international arena.\\\"\n46.\tIf aggression is committed, the Soviet Union always sides with the victim of the aggression. If trouble threatens our allies and friends, we always come to their aid. And when we sign treaties, we implement them and fulfill our obligations.\n47.\tThe objectives for which the Soviet Union and all the countries of the socialist community have been tirelessly fighting for many years have taken concrete form in the positive changes which have come about in the international situation. Together with our allies and friends we shall continue to fight for peace, freedom and the progress of the peoples.\n48.\tWhile consistently pursuing a policy of peace, the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community certainly do not claim to have a monopoly in this area. In the interests of peace, we are prepared to co-operate and we do co-operate with all States which are also prepared to do likewise. Whatever their social system and in whatever part of the world they may be situated, the door is closed to no one.\n49.\tThe broader the circle of countries pursuing a constructive foreign policy line and the larger the contribution each of them makes towards reducing tension, the more significant are the changes for the better in international affairs. Recent developments confirm this.\n50.\tIn the past, post-war periods have always turned out to be mere respites between wars. In the present circumstances real possibilities exist for a fundamentally different development, namely, a transition to a system of stable peace, in order to ensure which the United Nations was established.\n. \n51.\tThis transition requires the solution of problems engendered by the Second World War and the special features of development during the subsequent quarter of a century. If we tried to express in the most general form the essence of the changes that have taken place, we should say that it consists in the fact that there is now a possibility of solving some of these problems, while constructive work has begun with a view to settling others.\n52.\tThe territorial realities that have arisen in Europe, the continent where both World Wars originated, are gaining universal recognition and being formalized under international law. The entry into force of the well-known treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with the USSR, signed at Moscow on 12 August 1970, and with the Polish People's Republic, signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970, confirms the inviolability of European boundaries, including the boundary between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the western boundary of Poland.\n53.\tThe conclusion of the agreement on West Berlin eliminates a chronic source of friction between States in the very center of Europe.\n54.\tThe clearing of the legacy of war from European soil must be completed through the normalization of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the requirements of observing the sovereignty and independence of both those States and settling relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of recognizing the Munich Agreement as invalid from the very beginning. As you know, negotiations are being held on this matter and I should like to express the hope that they will have a positive outcome.\n55.\tNegotiations will soon take place on the conclusion of- a peace treaty between the USSR and Japan which should play its part in closing the book on the Second World War in Asia and in providing a lasting basis for peace and co-operation on that continent as well. For our part, we shall make efforts to ensure the success of these negotiations, but the same desire must of course exist on the other side too.\n56.\tOn the whole the \\\"cold war\\\" is being replaced by recognition of the truth that in the nuclear age there is no other basis for relations between States having different Social systems but peaceful coexistence. More and more often this is taking the form of binding international legal documents.\n57.\tThe prerequisites for many-sided and equal cooperation among States, in the political and other fields, are multiplying.\n58.\tThe high level of such co-operation attained in relations between the USSR and France is an especially conspicuous reflection of these new trends. Soviet-French relations are growing increasingly stronger and we note this with great satisfaction. The trends I have referred to are increasingly manifest in the Soviet Union's relations with a number of other States as well.\n59.\tAs a result of the Soviet-United States summit talks in Moscow in May of this year, a start has been made in the process of rebuilding relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.\n60.\t-\tOur country attaches great importance to its relations with the United States, a great Power wife a different social system. For our part we shall do everything in our power to develop these relations and we believe that this is in the interests of the Soviet and American peoples and in the interests of maintaining and strengthening international peace. The broadening of co-operation between the two countries has already begun to become a reality, although there remain and will remain political and ideological disagreements of principle between the Soviet Union and the United States as States having different social systems.\n61.\tNaturally, we proceed from the assumption that no improvement in Soviet-United States relations should be achieved at the expense of other States. This is an important principle of our policy in relations with any State. It is our conviction that all States should be guided by this principle in their mutual relations and it is this criterion which we apply in assessing the significance of various developments in relations between different countries.\n62.\tSince the first years after the Second World War, international relations have been complicated by the division of the world into military and political groupings which set some States against others and constantly carry the risk of a military conflict. The architects of the policy of establishing military blocs, pursuing the arms race and whipping up international tensions, who for a long time determined the foreign policy of the major Western capitalist Powers, worked hard to bring the world to the dangerous brink of a military conflict. Even today we are constantly encountering the consequences of that policy in various parts of the world.\n63.\tWe can therefore scarcely over-estimate the importance of even the first steps which are now being taken to lay the foundations of security on the basis of the collective efforts of all interested States.\n64.\tWe are now oh the eve of an all-European conference on questions of security and co-operation. Preparations for such a conference are to enter the practical phase very shortly. The great importance of this planned meeting of States lies in making Europe genuinely peaceful and in transforming relations among States on the European continent on the basis of mutual understanding and trust; we are in favor of such a policy and such a course of action in European affairs.\n65.\tIn the well-known Prague Declaration,  the European socialist countries have already put forward their suggestions as to how, in their view, a system of security in Europe should be built up. Many other States have also expressed their views on this score. This is a great and extremely important task and the all-European conference is expected to make an important contribution to its solution.\n66.\tWe are convinced that, if all interested States and Governments show a proper responsibility and a readiness to seek solutions which would be in the common interest, the conference will go down in the history of our time as a great success for the cause of peace.\n67.\tIn Asia, too, the idea of ensuring security, which is equally in the interests of all Asian States, is also beginning to gain ground. The Soviet Union considers the question of security in Asia to be an important task also. TTiose who, for some reason, are not now in sympathy with it should understand that the countries of Asia are no less interested than the Soviet Union in strengthening peace in that area.\n68.\tAlthough there has been noticeable progress towards a relaxation of international tension, it is hardly likely that anyone would dispute the fact that so far only a beginning has been made and that much more remains to be done. What is more, unless further progress is made and unless the efforts to achieve greater detente are intensified, all that has been gained could be lost. There have been such cases in history.\n69.\tSome of the problems awaiting solution within an international framework affect the interests of practically all States. If we consider the substance of any of the problems leading to international complications and if we focus our attention on what directly generates the danger of war and the unleashing of military conflicts, we can only come to the conclusion that it is the use of force by some States against others for the purpose of territorial annexation and for the purpose of subjugating peoples and establishing domination over them, in other words, for predatory purposes.\n70 This has been true up to now and remains true today.\n71.\tIn the past tens and hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa and America were reduced to slavery by colonial force. Today, when almost all of them have freed themselves, the slightest opportunity is used to restore direct or indirect colonial domination over them.\n72.\tThose who ventured in the past, and venture now, to use force for purposes which have nothing in common with the interests of the peoples are not greatly troubled by the fact that no dispute between States has ever been, or could ever be, settled on a lasting and just basis by means of force. The use of force for the purpose of aggression, territorial annexation and oppression of other peoples has as a rule laid the foundations for further hostility and further conflicts. For this the peoples have to pay, human beings perish and the great material treasures created by their toil are destroyed.\n73.\tThat is why progressive political leaders for almost as long as States themselves have existed have recognized the need to eliminate the use of force from relations between States. But mere understanding of this is, of course, not sufficient. Practical efforts by States are required. This is all the more necessary now that the presence and stockpiling bf nuclear weapons in the arsenals of States have radically changed the concept of the consequences which military conflicts can have for the peoples of the world.\n74.\tAlthough varying views can be held as to the likelihood that this or that crisis or conflict will develop into a nuclear confrontation, as long as nuclear weapons exist, this possibility and this danger also exist. No State, no Government can ignore this. Our country believes that it is possible to eliminate or, at least, to reduce drastically the danger of a conflict between States provoking a nuclear catastrophe. That can be done if renunciation of the use of force in international relations is elevated to the level of international law and if at the same time-I repeat, at the same time the use of nuclear weapons js prohibited.\n75.\tThe Soviet Government is convinced that serious consideration of these questions cannot be put off any longer. The conditions for this are already more favorable now than before and the possibilities for adopting positive decisions are broader.\n76.\tFor those reasons, and because it is aware of its responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Soviet Union has submitted for consideration at the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly the item entitled \\\"Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [A/8793].\n77.\tThe essence of our proposal is that it provides for the renunciation by States of any use of force to resolve international disputes; including the use both of nuclear weapons and of such types of weapons as are commonly called conventional. It is proposed that this renunciation be of such a nature that no one could avoid observing it strictly; this is possible if the United Nations shows the necessary understanding of its responsibility for the fate of the world.\n78.\tSuch an approach is fully in accordance with the fundamental principle proclaimed in the United Nations Charter under which the Members of the United Nations \\\"shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations\\\" [Article 2].\n79. The real state of affairs in the world makes it necessary to solve the question of the non-use of force in general and the question of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with each other.\n80. Ever since they first appeared, nuclear weapons have always been considered the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction. This is even truer now since the strength of these weapons is not a constant but is growing.\n81.\tIt would be wrong to lose sight of another aspect of the question: with the development of conventional types of weapons, the danger that they might be used in military conflicts has also increased several times even by comparison with the period of the Second World War. In the last quarter of a century nuclear weapons have not been used in military conflicts, yet who can be unaware of how many tragedies have been brought about by the use of conventional weapons and how numerous have been the victims of their use?\n82.\tAll this argues in favor of the prohibition of the use of force in violation of the United Nations Charter in conjunction with the prohibition of the use, first of all, of nuclear weapons, which are especially important.\n83.\tThe wisdom and expediency of such a decision have also been demonstrated by the experience which the United Nations has already gained in the consideration of problems of security and disarmament. The repeated attempts of the United Nations to find a solution to both these problems are fresh in everyone's memory. Attempts have been made now from one side, now from the other, now in terms of considering the question of the non-use of force, now in terms of considering the question of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. And what has transpired?\n84.\tTo take only recent years, the States Members of the United Nations have unanimously adopted a resolution on strict observance of the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations [resolution 2160 (XXI)], a Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)], and a Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].\n85.\tAt the real core of all these documents is the principle of the non-use of force in international relations and of the settlement of all disputes between States solely by peaceful means. All the necessary formulations have been carefully worked out and weighed on the political scales and all aspects of the problem seem to have been taken into account, but it is no secret that the goals set have still not been fully achieved; force is being used and human blood is being shed.\n86.\tMore than 10 years ago, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Declaration in which it proclaimed the use of nuclear weapons to be a crime against mankind and civilization [resolution 1653 (XVI)]. Since then the United Nations has repeatedly advocated the signing of an appropriate international convention by all States. However, the Declaration on the prohibition of the: use of nuclear weapons was not supported by all the nuclear Powers and it has still not been possible to initiate productive negotiations on the conclusion of an international convention on the question.\n87.\tMany reasons can be found for the ineffectiveness of the decisions adopted by the United Nations on these questions, but one of the most substantial is unarguably that they were considered and decided upon by the United Nations in isolation from one another.\n88.\tWhen the question of prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons was raised, several States had doubts as to the possibility of taking such a step if the use of force was not precluded in relations between States. We shall not now enter into a discussion of the question of the extent to which those doubts were justified but, whatever the case, they became an obstacle to agreement.\n89.\tAt the same time, when the question of prohibiting the use of force was considered, the significance of any decisions adopted proved to be limited in the absence of agreement concerning nuclear weapons, that is to say, the most powerful weapons of mass destruction. The separation of one question from the other introduced a certain lack of understanding and suspicion and weakened the effectiveness of the best decisions of the United Nations. Furthermore, their effectiveness was further restricted because they were all in the form of recommendations, or, at best, declarations of intent. They were not given the force of law.\n90.\tThe proposal of the Soviet Union [A/8793] envisages the adoption of the most realistic and effective decision possible in modern conditions. It is precisely such a decision which is in the interests of all States, regardless of their social systems, the size of their territory and population, or whether or not they possess nuclear weapons.\n91.\tAs a result of such a decision, those States which are militarily stronger, and above all the nuclear Powers, will obtain greater mutual assurance that they are under no threat from one another. The security of each of them will be safeguarded more reliably and at the same time on an equal basis, that is to say, no one will gain a unilateral advantage at the expense of another in comparison with the situation which prevails at present, and no one would lose anything.\n92.\tThose States which are militarily less powerful, including all those which do not possess nuclear weapons, would also gain. Now, they are justifiably concerned at the danger that nuclear weapons might be directed against them if aggression is committed. The prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with the renunciation of the use of force would remove this threat and greatly strengthen the security of all States.\n93.\tIt goes without saying that the obligation of States to renounce the use of force, including nuclear weapons, can in no way impair their right to individual and collective self-defense as laid down in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. On the contrary, that obligation would reinforce the right to self-defense against aggression and the right to struggle to eliminate the consequences of aggression in cases where it has already been committed and the aggressor seeks to benefit from it.\n94.\tNo one can challenge the inalienable right of States and peoples subjected to aggression to repulse it by employing all possible means so long as the aggressor continues to use force, encroaches upon their freedom and sovereignty and tries to retain territories seized by force. It will suffice to refer to the examples before everyone's eyes: Indochina and the Middle East. Who would dare to contest the incontestable fact that brute force has been and still is being used against the peoples of Indochina and against the Arab States and that they are entitled to use all the necessary means to rebuff the aggressor?\n95.\tRenunciation of the use of force in relations between States in no way limits the right of the peoples of colonial countries to fight for their freedom and independence using any means which may be necessary in that struggle. This right is recognized by the United Nations as being a legitimate one. It is based on the fact that violence was used against those peoples, who have been the victims of colonialism and aggression, and, in resorting to force to liberate themselves, they are only restoring justice and their flouted rights.\n96.\tThe adoption of a decision on non-use of force and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would thus be beneficial to all. But this also makes it necessary for all States, particularly all those Powers which possess nuclear weapons, to participate in its elaboration and adoption. Otherwise no decision, not even the very best one, could attain the desired objective.\n97.\tThe Soviet Government has given thorough consideration to the question of the most appropriate form for a decision by the United Nations on the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. We propose that consideration of this item should result in the adoption of a clear-cut decision, which, in the interests of maximum effectiveness, should bind together appropriate actions by the two main organs of the United Nations the General Assembly and the Security Council. On behalf of the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation is submitting the following draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly:\n[The speaker then read out the text of a draft resolution which was subsequently circulated as document A/L.676. For the text, see Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-seventh session, Annexes, agenda item 25.]\n98.\tThe proposed draft speaks for itself. It envisages a major step on the part of the General Assembly a decision on behalf of States Members of the United Nations on their renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. It contains an appeal to the Security Council to take action to make this declaration binding on all States. For this purpose, and in accordance with well-known provisions of the United Nations Charter, a meeting of the Security Council should be convened at the level of members of Governments or other specially designated representatives.\n99.\tThe Soviet delegation is authorized to state that the Soviet Union will stand ready to participate in the convening of such a meeting of the Security Council and in its work. We shall be ready to join in this political action with all other States which are permanent members of the Council. We are convinced that there can be no higher duty for those States on which the Charter of the United Nations places a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n100.\tWe appeal to all States represented in the General Assembly to study carefully the draft we have submitted and, on the basis \\\"of it, to adopt-unanimously a resolution which will reflect the firm will of this world Organization to put an end to any use of force in relations between States in violation of the United Nations Charter and to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.\n101.\tIn so doing, the United Nations will be giving strong support to the cause of a further relaxation of international tension, the strengthening of peace and increased mutual understanding in relations between States. This step will be in the interests of all those to whom peace, security and peaceful coexistence are not merely words but a guide for action.\n102.\tThe task of building a lasting peace requires the adoption of effective measures to prevent and avert military conflicts in the future. But it is no less important to put an end to the conflicts which are poisoning the international atmosphere now and to put out the military fires in areas where the right of peoples to be masters of their own destinies is being encroached upon. Lack of progress in settling these problems cannot but cause deep anxiety for the future course of world affairs.\n103.\tThe position of the Soviet Union concerning the war against the Vietnamese people is known to all. The continuation and expansion of the United States intervention in Viet-Nam and other countries of Indochina provoke indignation and condemnation. Probably never before have so many declarations been made containing promises to leave Viet-Nam and to stop the war as have been made recently. And never before has there been such a striking contrast between words and deeds. No matter how much the United States manipulates reports on reductions in the strength of the United States infantry in Viet-Nam in order to appease the public, behind those reports there is in reality an unprecedented expansion of military activities and of their cruelty and inhumanity. No matter how many assurances it gives us that it does not wish to settle the internal affairs of the Viet-Nam people for them, it is in fact pursuing a policy that is aimed at eliminating the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the people's armed forces of liberation and at preserving the Saigon puppet administration as the sole legitimate authority in South Viet-Nam.\n104.\tOne can only wonder why the only correct conclusion has not yet been drawn: namely, that the Vietnamese people cannot be defeated. Their resistance will not be broken either by heavier bombing, the blockading of ports or damage to hydro-technical installations. The Vietnamese people are fighting heroically against aggression and fighting for just aims, in order to be master in their own country. They cannot allow anyone from outside to prescribe a political and social system for them or to impose puppets who uphold interests that are foreign to the Vietnamese people.\n105.\tA way out can be found, but only through serious negotiations, for which a constructive basis has been provided by the well-known proposals contained in the statements by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972 and by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam of 14 September 1972.\n106.\tThe essence of these proposals is clear and simple. The United States of America must respect the right of the Vietnamese people to genuine independence and the right of the people of South Viet-Nam to self-determination. It must stop the war of aggression in Viet-Nam. put an end to the bombing and mining, the blockade and all military activities in Viet-Nam, renounce the policy of the \\\"Vietnamization\\\" of the war, immediately withdraw all United States troops from South Viet-Nam and discontinue its military participation and support of the Saigon puppet regime. In the solution of the internal problem of South Viet-Nam, it is essential to work on the basis of the real situation: two authorities, two armies and other political forces exist there. The basis for the solution of the problem lies in the equality of the parties and a rejection of annexation. To that end it is necessary to set up in South Viet-Nam a provisional Government which has been agreed on nationally on a tripartite basis and which will handle all matters during the transitional period and organize general elections on truly free and democratic lines.\n107.\tAll those who respect the rights of the peoples and all those who have not lost the ability to assess the state of affairs objectively cannot but recognize that these proposals are very well founded, reasonable and logical and that they express the goodwill of the Vietnamese people. They cannot but reject categorically allegations that the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam is trying to impose a \\\"Communist regime\\\" on South Viet-Nam.\n108.\tIf the United States of America wants the negotiations in Paris to lead to the restoration of peace, it should reply positively to the statement by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972. If, however, it is pursuing some other goal, then the talks in Paris can only lead to a deadlock, the war will continue and the full responsibility for it will rest with the United States of America.\n109.\tAs far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it fully supports the proposals by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. All those who cherish the ideals of freedom and independence cannot fail to have a sense of solidarity with the Vietnamese people in their struggle.\n110.\tA solution to the problems of the Middle East must be found. Recent events linked with the new criminal acts of aggression by Israel against Arab countries, including Lebanon, show how serious is the danger and how far the Israeli leaders are going in their reckless policy.\n111.\tThe responsibility which rests with the aggressors is shared by all those who protect them and whose support enables Israel to defy the United Nations and its decisions regarding the elimination of the consequences of the aggression and the restoration of peace in the Middle East. The Israeli leaders must know that an adventurist policy can lead only to apparent success and that in the final analysis it will inevitably entail retribution.\n112.\tThe attempts to appropriate Arab lands and repeated military acts of aggression cannot be tolerated. The United\nNations has the necessary right and the possibilities to put the aggressor in his place.\n113.\tOnly a long-term and just settlement in the Middle East in accordance with the well-known decisions of the United Nations can ensure the peace and security of all-we repeat, all-States in this region. The Israeli troops must be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967.\n114.\tFor the Soviet Union, support for the legitimate demands of the Arab countries, for the United Nations decisions regarding a political settlement of the Middle East conflict, and for the mission of Ambassador Jarring is a policy of principle. We are pursuing it and we shall continue to pursue it unswervingly.\n115.\tWe also support the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for the restoration of their inalienable rights, which have been recognized by the United Nations. At the same time, we cannot, of course, condone the acts of terrorism committed by certain elements among the members of the Palestinian movement which have led, among other things, to the recent tragic events in Munich. Their criminal acts also strike a blow at the national interests and aspirations of the Palestinians and are used by the Israeli criminals to cover up their own piratical policy against the Arab peoples.\n116.\tOn the basis of positions of principle, the Soviet Union opposes acts of terrorism which disrupt the diplomatic activities of States and their representatives, transport communications between them and the normal course of international contacts and meetings, and it opposes acts of violence which serve no positive end and cause loss of human life.\n117.\tPeace will not be truly lasting until an end is put to the arms race, which is one of the main sources of distrust among States and of an increased danger of war. The struggle for disarmament has been going on for a long time The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community see in the struggle for disarmament one of the main orientations for their foreign policy activities. And this policy will be continued. Some of the things that seemed almost unattainable even 10 or 15 years ago are now reflected in treaties and agreements that have entered into force. These include some which to a certain extent curb the nuclear arms race and reduce the threat of nuclear war: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373(XXII), annex], the Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the three environments, and others. In addition, the first agreement in history on the elimination of a type of armaments which falls within the category of means of mass destruction, namely, bacteriological and toxin weapons, has now been concluded.\n118.\tTo the sum total of obligations in the field of the limitation of the arms race and disarmament already assumed by the majority of States, one more has recently been added: it concerns those types of armaments which have the greatest destructive force. I am referring to the Soviet-United States strategic arms limitation agreements, signed at Moscow on 26 May 1972. Limiting to the minimum the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems, the agreements eliminate one of the main motives for unleashing a competition between offensive and defensive missile weapons, the full consequences of which are difficult to predict. By establishing quantitative limits for strategic offensive arms for the first time, the agreements curb the most dangerous trend in the arms race.\n119.\tThe conclusion of the Soviet-United States strategic arms limitation agreements is an important step which will help to reduce the threat of nuclear war and to curb the arms race and which will open up new prospects for progress towards general disarmament. Both sides have agreed to continue the talks with a view to arriving at further agreements in that direction.\n120.\tEach successful step in the struggle to limit the arms race is important in its own right and is, at the same time, important as a starting point for further efforts. The possibilities for further progress towards the solution of new disarmament problems will increase with each new step on which agreement is reached. Our country has always desired this and we shall spare no effort in continuing to work, together with all other States, to relieve the peoples of the burden of weapons.\n121.\tThe Soviet Union favors the earliest possible solution of the question of the halting of the production of chemical weapons and their destruction, concerning which negotiations are being held in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. It also favors the halting everywhere and by everyone of nuclear weapon tests, including underground tests, the elimination of foreign military bases on alien territory and the establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.\n122.\tStates have acquired a great deal of experience in negotiations on disarmament. Various methods have been used and are being used; some of them have fully justified themselves and should be used further. At the same time it can hardly be considered proper that, since the advent of the nuclear age, there has not yet been a single occasion on which States have all gathered together to consider the question of disarmament, which affects all States, socialist and capitalist, large and small, developed and developing, nuclear, and non-nuclear. We can therefore only welcome the fact that the idea of convening a world disarmament conference has become one of the most popular ideas among the States of the world and among world public opinion.\n123.\tThe General Assembly will be considering in a specific manner the question of convening a world disarmament conference [item 26]. Our views on this are well known. We consider that this conference should be a forum at which all countries without exception could present and compare, on an equal basis, their views on the whole range of disarmament questions and come to agreement on practical steps designed to curb the arms race and achieve disarmament. This applies both to weapons of mass destruction and to conventional weapons.\n124.\tThe Soviet Government believes that full advantage should be taken of the opportunities that are now taking shape for the convening of a world disarmament conference. We, for our part, shall continue to do everything in our power to ensure that it is held and is successful.\n125.\tThe question of the strengthening of international security is once again on the agenda of the General Assembly [item 35], This problem is an urgent one and will remain so as long as there are forces at work which are interested not in implementing the principles of the United Nations Charter but in aggravating international tension and suppressing the liberation struggle of the peoples.\n126.\tGreat victories have been won by the peoples in their struggle to eliminate colonial oppression. But this problem has not yet been completely solved and millions of people are still living under the colonial and racist yoke.\n127.\tThe Soviet Union, which was the first country in the history of the world to eradicate national oppression and to ensure genuine prosperity for dozens of nations and nationalities, is irreconcilably opposed to all manifestations of racism, apartheid, colonialism and neocolonialism. Our country opposes all attempts to exert pressure direct or indirect-on States which, after a hard struggle, have won the right to independent development and are now building their national economies, carrying out progressive social and economic reforms and defending their rights to own the natural resources that belong to them. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist those States in every way possible to strengthen their sovereignty and independence.\n128.\tIn international politics it is necessary constantly to take account of the various questions posed by scientific and technological progress and the requirements which such progress is making on an ever-increasing scale in the field of international co-operation. This applies to economic, scientific and technological links, which are becoming ever richer in content. It applies directly to new areas in which States are active, particularly outer space.\n129.\tIt was on the basis of those considerations that the Soviet Union submitted proposals on principles governing the activities of States in outer space, on the conclusion of a treaty concerning the moon and on a number of other matters. At the current session of the General Assembly we are proposing that consideration should be given to the item entitled \\\"Preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting\\\" [item 37]. Our purpose in raising this question is to link inseparably, from the very beginning, the use of this new type of space technology to the noble purposes of strengthening peace and friendship among peoples.\n130.\tThe United Nations must promptly acquire a genuinely universal character. Universality could lend the United Nations new strength and enable it to consider world problems with greater results. We therefore see no justification for attempts to create artificial obstacle to the admission of new States to the United Nations.\n131.\tWe consider it necessary to ensure the earliest possible admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic, which is fully entitled to be admitted, as is, of course, the Federal Republic of Germany too. This will be in the interests of the further development of co-operation among States and will be in line with the political situation taking shape in Europe.\n132.\tNo one should cast doubt on the legitimate right to membership in the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, which has recently gained its national independence. That State has a legitimate right to become a Member of the United Nations.\n133.\tIn general, the United Nations should rid itself as quickly as possible of the burden of the past, which is still making itself felt in its activities in various spheres. One such sphere is that of questions relating to Korea. This year there are new possibilities before the General Assembly for a constructive approach to the discussion and solution of these questions. Such possibilities had been afforded by the proposal put forward by the non-aligned and socialist States concerning the \\\"Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea\\\" [A/8752 and Add. 1-10]. But those who in the past created a hotbed of tension in the Korean region and are now trying to maintain it have prevented the General Assembly from considering this proposal at the current session. Everyone understands that an artificial delay in this case can only be harmful and that those States which resort to such methods are showing themselves to be opposed to a just settlement in the interests of the normalization of the situation in Korea and the strengthening of peace in that area.\n134.\tAs to the Soviet Union, our position on the question of Korea has been set out many times. We are in favor of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and support the measures and efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful unification of the country.\n135.\tDuring the period in which the United Nations has existed, attempts have been made on more than one occasion to destroy its Charter. Whatever the subjective intentions of those who are now raising the question of the review of the United Nations Charter, the objective reality is such that this will entail great dangers for all the activities of the United Nations.\n136.\tThe Soviet Union considers that the interests of all States without exception require that attention should be focused not on a revision of the United Nations Charter but on its strict observance and on fuller utilization of the possibilities it affords.\n137.\tWhat is necessary for the United Nations to succeed is the readiness and determination of Member States to act together in the interests of solving the problems facing the Organization. This should make the United Nations a real center for concerted action by nations to achieve common goals, which is an obligation under the United Nations Charter.\n138.\tThose who seek to divide the United Nations either according to the principle of the size of the territory or\npopulation of States or by classifying them as \\\"rich\\\" and \\\"poor\\\" are doing a disservice not only to the United Nations but also to the cause of preserving and strengthening peace as a whole.\n139, That is not what inspired the founders of the United Nations. They wanted the United Nations to be strong and firm in rebuffing aggressors and to be capable of promoting co-operation among all countries irrespective of their size and level of economic development.\n| 140. As to the Soviet Union, it has invariably done and will continue to do everything it can to ensure that the United Nations acts precisely in that manner. The policy of the struggle for peace and security is the general policy of the Soviet Union in the international arena. That policy was adopted half a century ago by. the socialist republics which joined together to form the Soviet Union and it is still the policy today.\n141.\tThe twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is a regular session. But it could become a prominent landmark in the formation of a new system of peaceful relations among States. For this purpose it should focus its attention on the main and most acute political problems brought to the fore by life itself and the whole course of international development.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in taking the floor for the- first time in this august Assembly, my delegation and I myself have the pleasant duty of conveying to you, first of all, our sincere congratulations on your election, to which my delegation contributed whole-heartedly. That election is a recognition of the qualities and ability that you have displayed in your country, in international life, and more particularly in your work at the United Nations. We are convinced that your objectivity, tact and sense of impartiality will imbue our work with the brilliance that it rightly deserves, and will achieve the results that the world expects.\n225.\tOur Government is also pleased to see in your election a symbol of the evolution of our Organization, because you represent a country and a social system whose successes are day by day impressing an ever-growing portion of humanity and whose views are gaining increased acceptance in this Assembly.\n226.\tMay I also be permitted to pay a fitting tribute to Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, for the calm and effective manner in which he presided over the debates of the twenty-sixth session.\n227.\tLastly, we should like to congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our new Secretary-General, who, in the short time that he has had since his brilliant election, has spared no effort to apply the principles of the Charter.\n228.\tThis annual meeting of the representatives of many peoples of our world is always an occasion for meditation about the ties between nations. Even if the purposes that the United Nations had set for itself have not been attained, it is none the less proper constantly to ask ourselves if some positive results for the establishment of world peace have at least been obtained. Will the peoples whom we represent begin to see the dawn of the dream that the wisest of their ancestors cherished since the beginning of our existence, or, on the contrary, is their life still to be nothing but a ridiculous and intolerable nightmare.\n229.\tAt first sight, in looking back at the great events that have marked international life since the beginning of this year, some of us might be inclined to find some sources of satisfaction. Many clouds fraught with threats and conflicts have in fact been dispelled and dialogs that yesterday were impossible have been started. Man in 1972 has witnessed events which the most optimistic of prophets would have hesitated to forecast only a few years ago. And, even if these encounters and these conversations are still only harbingers and do not yet represent any real change, they at least reflect the sincere desire of mankind to go beyond immobility and misunderstanding, in order to progress towards the recognition of others and the right of others to live. We are perhaps only at the stage of a comedy of peace which is being played by the leaders of this world. But if they are doing this, it is because they feel compelled to do this by the pressure of their peoples. But, for that matter, if they are content only to play at the drama, they will create in their peoples a desire to come upon the stage and become no longer actors in an imaginary history, but actors, once and for all, in a real drama according to the dictates of their heart.\n230.\tAmong the rapprochements that have taken place, we wish to emphasize the satisfaction that we felt at the dialog begun between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We hope that these conversations will succeed and that these two countries will be sitting in this Assembly, as we have always felt that they should.\n231.\tBut we are compelled to note that when we talk about peace in the world in which we live it is much more the peace of the advanced countries of the world. Europe and North America, swathed in the comforts offered them by the consumer society of our century, fear that this civilization of opulence may be attacked, this civilization that they have acquired at the cost of the blood and sweat of both the colonial and the neo-colonial countries, but they are disinterested in the fate of the damned of the third world. In order to maintain their way of life, they even go so far as to support war in a disguised form in those parts of the world where they are draining out the wealth.\n232.\tAccordingly, my delegation is disappointed to note once again that the debate on Korea has been postponed until 1973. thus allowing imperialism to maintain a threatening climate in that region.\n233.\tBut when we refer to zones where peace is not assured, it is of our Africa that we think first. There we still have a situation in flagrant contradiction with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, one which constitutes an insolent and criminal negation of fundamental human rights, of man's dignity, his value, and in the last analysis of the equality and the rights of peoples. Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are still under Portuguese colonialist domination. And there is no need to be any great authority in political matters to know that that small country can persist stubbornly in its policy, despite the resolutions of the United Nations, only because it knows that it enjoys the financial, military, political and diplomatic complicity of certain Powers, particularly those which are members of NATO.\n234.\tAnd it is also because those Powers treat with contempt and disdain the resolutions that we adopt here that the illegal regime of Ian Smith in Zimbabwe defies the civilized world at the expense of the black population of that part of Africa. And lastly it is for the same reason and strengthened by the same support that the minority and racist regime of Pretoria not only imposes its dictatorship and its inhuman regime of apartheid in South Africa and in Namibia, but even threatens the sovereignty and peace of States which in southern and central Africa have freed themselves from the colonialist yoke.\n235.\tThe relaxation of tension at the international level which emerged this year thus makes even more unacceptable the unjust and criminal aggression that a Power of the dimensions of the United States continually perpetrates day after day against the heroic Indochinese people of VietNam, Laos and Cambodia. While it proclaimed in San Francisco, on 26 June 1945, that it was \\\"determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\", one of the signatories to this Charter, and not among the least of them, today is happily forcing upon a people which had already experienced a long and heroic armed struggle for national liberation the most painful and atrocious of wars that mankind has ever known. This is a war in which the United States is not satisfied merely with killing the combatants, but also kills women and children; war where the aggressor, flouting all laws, destroys hospitals and schools, compelling man to live underground; a war which destroys the dikes that the people of Vietnam had built in their struggle with nature. To sum up, this is a war where defoliants, herbicides and other biological and bacteriological weapons destroy even the environment where, once peace has been restored, the children of the heroes who today are giving their lives for their freedom will be expected to live.\n236.\tIn this connexion, the stubborn and guilty silence of the United States administration in the face of the seven-point peace proposal put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam and in the face of the proposal of 11 September to set up a tripartite Government of national concord provides just so many examples of the basically bellicose nature of imperialism.\n237.\tNone of us is deceived by the United States maneuvers. The reduction in its land troops and the so-called \\\"Vietnamization policy\\\" are actually accompanied by an increase of its air and naval forces and attacks.\n238.\tIt is that same war which the United States is pursuing throughout IndoChina by laying waste to Laos and supporting in Cambodia a clique thrown out by the people, so much so that in fact, the troops of the United Front of Kampuchea control 80 per cent of the territory. That is why my Government is pleased to have recognized, from the outset, the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, which is headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, to whom, for that matter, justice has just been done at the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Georgetown, when the status of full member was conferred upon him.\n239.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo believes that it is high time to restore the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union in the United Nations. Let us hope that the absurd situation which led to the failure to recognize the People's Republic of China for more than 20 years is not going to be repeated in defense of the clique which today usurps power in Phnom Penh.\n240.\tBut does all of this not show the impotence of the United Nations to enforce respect for the principles of its Charter an impotence which makes of most of our resolutions mere pieces of paper reflecting more our wishes than our real capacity to fight against the blind forces of war? Thus, despite Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which enjoined Israel to leave the occupied Egyptian territories, we see continued a situation which we believed had disappeared from the contemporary world, that is, a situation where one country invades another. The impotence of the United Nations in the face of this crime brings a bitter smile to the lips of our peoples, who have not forgotten, and can never forget, that at the time we were gaining our independence we saw the United Nations transport its troops to certain parts of Africa, not to establish the peace that was desired, but to engage in active intervention in the domestic affairs of our peoples. Yesterday it could intervene against the interests of Africa; today it is unable to restore the rights of an African country.\n241.\tFrom all these events we are justified in concluding that if, on the one hand, an atmosphere of relaxation of tension has blossomed on our planet in this year 1972, it was outside of our Organization and, what is more, our Organization has not prevented its most influential Members from applying the law of violence at the expense of many peoples.\n242.\tWhen, in addition, we note\\\" that the very people who promised peace to the world at San Francisco in 1945 are the same who now maintain situations of injustice and promote contempt for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law, one wonders whether certain States deserve the privileges they enjoy in the Security Council and whether the Charter of the United Nations should not be reviewed so that our Organization can undertake to promote the right of peoples to self- determination and peace through action commensurate with the vast sums which we give to it.\n243.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo, as well as Africa as a whole, is no longer under any illusion about the role of the United Nations as it is being shaped by the imperialist Powers. We have already learned the lesson that it is only by their own struggle that our peoples have won the right to enter this Assembly. The same is true for those who today claim their right to live. The impotence of our Organization compels them to have recourse to the on the path left open to them, that is to say, to take up arms. It is not our resolutions but their victories over Portuguese colonialism which will enable Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) to regain their legitimate rights.\n244.\tIn this connexion the report of the OAU Committee of Liberation on Guinea (Bissau) stripped the blinders from the eyes of those who persisted in considering that our freedom fighters were a handful of adventurers with no roots in the people. This time it has been decisively confirmed that the fighters of the PAIGC  effectively control two thirds of the territory. However, in Angola and Mozambique there are also vast areas that have been completely freed from colonial domination. These zones that are controlled politically and administratively by the liberation movements deserve aid from the United Nations for their reorganization and reconstruction.\n245.\tAs for South Africa, whose presence in this hall in. the form of a racist delegation is a direct affront to every African delegation, no honorable solution can be found other than through force used intelligently and for liberation against blind brutality.\n246.\tIn Zimbabwe, Great Britain was disconcerted by the popular reaction to the Anglo-Rhodesian agreement. Despite the measures of intimidation and reprisals of the Ian Smith minority clique, the people of Zimbabwe expressed themselves so decisively that the Pearce Commission, as we know, could not avoid noting the unpopularity of that agreement. Today, when the conclusions of this Commission are widely known, Great Britain would make a serious mistake if in examining the Pearce report  it frustrates the hope the African peoples still place in it. From the historical perspective, Great Britain has much more to gain by taking account of the rights of the African people than by considering the sordid interests of a handful of racists. My Government is convinced that the only solution to the problem of Zimbabwe is independence with the formation of a government by the African majority. The first stage would be the convening of a constitutional conference bringing together all sectors of the population, beginning with the liberation movements.\n247.\tMy delegation has read with interest and attention the report on Namibia prepared by the Secretary-General.  This is an opportunity for us to repeat the responsibility which devolves upon the United Nations in this part of Africa. As for our part, we cannot subscribe to any solution which does not provide for the unconditional withdrawal from Namibia of the South African police and administration. The powers of the United Nations in this Territory should be guaranteed by an international armed force which can enable the Namibian people to create, free from any foreign intervention, the conditions suitable for the exercise of its right to self-determination in unity and not in an ethnic and racial federalism which the South African racists would like to have and, as we know, they have already installed the black populations on the least desirable land.\n248.\tWhile, on the one hand we take note of the appointment of a United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia, we regret that it should have been necessary to bow to the caprice of the Pretoria racists, who took the liberty of rejecting the first nominations to that post. But regardless of any hidden motives on Pretoria's part, we are sure that the High Commissioner is aware that his task is to safeguard the interests of the people of Namibia and not those of the Pretoria racists. Let him be wary of their proposal for self-determination; let him remember that that self-determination must not impair either the territorial integrity of Namibia or the unity of its people. The High Commissioner has a responsibility not only as a civil servant vis-a-vis the Secretary-General, but also a still greater responsibility to the peoples of Africa and to history.\n249.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo endorses the following plan as it was enunciated by the South West Africa People's Organization: first, if on 15 September 1972 the Pretoria regime has not committed itself definitely to withdraw its administration from Namibia and has not made arrangements for that withdrawal; secondly, if South Africa does not demonstrate without ambiguity that it is prepared to recognize the right of the people of Namibia to independence as a single national entity; and thirdly, if South Africa does not commit itself clearly to recognize the political, civil, economic, social and cultural right of the Namibian people freely to determine their future without foreign intervention, then it will be useless to pursue any other form of contacts between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the racists of Pretoria.\n250.\tIf that were to be the case, no matter how unseemly it may be to have to say this, Africa, in the settlement of its problems, will have less and less confidence in the United Nations and much more faith in itself. In the last analysis, this is what it has already stated quite recently at the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Rabat, when, after the disappointing results of the meetings of the Security Council at Addis Ababa, it decided to increase its aid to the liberation movements. This is also what it expresses each day more and more clearly by settling itself the disputes which arise within its frontiers. In saying this, we are thinking of the reconciliation achieved between Guinea and Senegal, between Guinea and the Ivory Coast, the treaty signed at Rabat between Algeria and Morocco under the aegis of the recent summit, meeting of OAU, the reconciliation between Zaire and my country, the efforts which are now under way between President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and President Ngouabi of the People's Republic of the Congo, to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute between Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and lastly those efforts which are being undertaken by President Siad Barre of Somalia to quench the fire that has just blazed up along the frontiers between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n251.\tAll these contributions to peace deserve our praise and should be emphasized as victories of the people against imperialism, which is, in our opinion, the primary root cause of the wars of our era.\n252.\tJust so long as that scourge exists we strongly doubt the possibilities for disarmament. But even if the damned of the earth use weapons to liberate themselves, they are not responsible for armed conflicts. They take up arms because they are refused any other solution. They use weapons because their claims are met only with armed troops. We would prefer peace in which to liberate ourselves, because we know that in these liberation struggles it is we who pay the heaviest price in human lives, lives which we shall need for our national rebuilding. This I say to show you how much we are in favor of disarmament. If that were a reality, complete and effective, nothing could oppose the peaceful march of peoples towards the reconquest of their rights. But we do not subscribe to a partial formula of disarmament. Moreover, we refuse to have this problem of disarmament, even if it is only the question of nuclear weapons, dealt with only by the Powers that possess the most advanced weapons. The peace of the world will be the concern of all nations, large and small, or it will be the concern of none.\n253.\tMy delegation cannot remain silent in the face of the insidious maneuvers of certain great Powers which, while they promote racism in certain parts of the world for which they bear responsibility, today want an African State which wished to exercise its sovereignty to be tried by our Organization, we are told, for crimes against humanity. We consider that it is not our business to pass any value judgment on the decision taken by the Government of Uganda, to which reference was made here yesterday by Sir Alec Douglas-Home [2042nd meeting]. This is not the first time in history that a sovereign State, including the United Kingdom, has expelled foreigners from its national soil without any reckoning being demanded of it. The United Nations is not competent to deal with this problem, although it could ask for an explanation from the United Kingdom, which does not want to see returned to its shores British citizens who are not of Anglo-Saxon origin.\n254.\tWe shall therefore oppose and we call upon all delegations of Africa and all countries that love justice and peace to oppose what would be a mockery of justice.\n255.\tBut how can I conclude without saying a word about this problem which the Secretary-General has proposed for inclusion in our agenda [A/8791 and Add.l], the definition of which is so delicate in nature that it threatens to stir up our jurists just as much as the concept of aggression has stirred them. Of course I am referring to the question of terrorism.\n256.\tMay I be permitted to state that my Government is surprised that a problem which if not as old as the world itself is at least much older than the United Nations should be brought to our attention only as the result of the attacks which have just cast a pall over the Olympic games at Munich, attacks which we deplore.\n257.\tBut it would be unfortunate if under the guise of fine sentiments we should seek actually to condemn the action of the Palestinians and the other freedom fighters.\n258.\tWhat we are witnessing today is the protective reaction of the world of the well-to-do and high-principled nations, which have seen death strike by chance and hit some of their own people unjustly. However, that world never raised its voice against the terrorism that it spread beyond its frontiers and its seas. It is we, the Africans and Asians who have experienced European terror when, debarking on our shores, they hunted us in order to sell us, when they penned us up in order better to enslave and exploit us.\n259.\tColonel de Montagnac, one of the conquerors of Algeria, wrote: \\\"To dispel the thoughts which sometimes beset me, I have heads cut off, and not artichoke heads, but rather human heads.\\\" That is terrorism.\n260.\tPierre Loti, the well-known writer, described the taking of Thouan-An in Annam in Le Figaro in September 1883 as follows:\n\\\"Then the great slaughter began. We had volleys of shots fired and it was a pleasure to see the bursts of the shots which were so easily aimed, showered on them twice every minute, by command*. in a methodical and sure-fire manner ... We saw people who were absolutely crazy, who revealed a dizzy impulse to run ... They followed a zig-zag course throughout the length of this death run; then they squat down on their haunches in a comical fashion . .. and then we amused ourselves with counting the dead.\\\"\nThat is terrorism. We are not quoting these two examples in order to reopen a case which has. already been tried many times, but rather to recall that this terrorism, adapted to meet the requirements of space and time, still continues today in South Africa, in Zimbabwe and in the Portuguese colonies.\n261.\tIn addition to this terrorism we have that which day by day the United States bombers inflict on civilian populations, women, the sick in hospital and children in schools in Vietnam. The bombing of Guernica inspired Picasso to create one of the most famous canvases of this century, which is an outcry of horror against nazism. But Guernica is happening today, more than 400 times in a single day in Vietnam. Is there any greater terror? And why do people pretend to ignore that terror which has just been spread blindly along the frontiers of Lebanon by the armies and aircraft of Israeli Zionism?\n262.\tIt is said that the Palestinians failed to respect the Olympic truce, which has a tradition consecrated by more than a thousand years, but we were not aware either that during the period of the Games any calm appeared as a result of the initiative of the colonialists and imperialists in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau), in South Africa, in Zimbabwe or in Indochina.\n263.\tIf in the People's Republic of the Congo we think that the best form of struggle is that which associates the masses with the action we still do not have that good conscience which authorizes certain people to dictate the form of struggle for those who are fighting for their rights and whom the oppressor forces to extremes out of which gestures of desperation are born. We cannot judge with the same severity the oppressor and the oppressed. Otherwise we should be taking the part of the former against the latter.\n264.\tMoreover, in the official education it provides for its children the Christian and bourgeois West has found it proper to devote pages of tributes to the terrorists who liberated their countries by harassing the invaders. There was Fabius Cunctator against the Carthaginians; there was Spartacus against the masters of the slaves, Vercingetorix against the Romans, the Spanish patriots against the armies of Napoleon; there were the partisans throughout Europe, the \\\"soldiers of the night\\\" against nazism to whom Andre Malraux referred.\n265.\tAll police measures against these actions and against the hijacking of aircraft for political reasons will remain without effect. What we need is to uproot the evil completely: to uproot racism, colonialism and imperialism; to return their country to the Palestinians. We cannot separate their actions from the circumstances that have engendered them. They were engendered in conditions that we made favorable by ignoring their rights, by taking no interest in their fate, by throwing them into a ghetto beyond the bounds of humanity. If the Europeans of 1972 no longer blow up trains and bridges, it is because their countries are free. Palestinians in a Palestine regained will go to the Olympic Games, no longer to take hostages but to compete with other nations in the stadium games just as the Palestinians in a Palestine regained will no longer have any reason to hijack aircraft.\n266.\tYou of course understand that we have not made a profession of faith in terrorism, but we wanted to express our vehement opposition to any trend or to any draft resolution the purpose of which would be to absolve the consciences of those who wish to condemn terrorists but excuse those engenderers of terrorism, to whom I have referred in sufficient detail throughout my statement.\n267. As everyone knows, our world is marked by a fundamental imbalance in the process of the development of nations. Two quite separate blocs characterize in shocking terms the economic structures of the countries of the world. These are the zones of abundance on the one hand and the poverty zones on the other. This contradiction was created in the name of a so-called civilizing and humanitarian mission undertaken by the colonizing Powers.\n268.\tBut in reality these Powers have contributed and continue to contribute to the despoiling of the resources of the countries making up the poorer zones. Colonization has constituted and continues to constitute the most violent weapon the most virulent scourge obstructing the developing of a large part of the world.\n269.\tThe colonizing Powers bear the heavy responsibility for the backwardness in economic development which afflicts the majority of the countries of the third world today.\n270.\tIt is another scandal of our era that on one and the same planet individuals of the same species do not enjoy in the same manner the fruits of the progress of science and technology of the modern age. While some live in abundance and even in waste, others are condemned to attempt to survive in misery and almost total deprivation, in conditions in which life is only a pause between birth and death. Hence it is quite obvious that such a disequilibrium deepens the contradictions between the wealthy and the poor. Those who are hungry have a legitimate right to demand that the distribution of the fruits of science and technology should be done in an equitable, even-handed manner, as they are well aware that their servitude and then- exploitation financed this formidable flowering of science and technology which we are witnessing.\n271.\tTo soften the ultimate logical reactions of the poorer countries, at one time it was thought that the wealthier countries would become increasingly aware'-of the poverty of the countries of the third world. What is more, it was thought that this awareness would lead them to work out a vast program of co-operation in order to lessen the economic imbalance which divides them from the developing countries.\n272.\tThus, immediately after they had attained their independence, several countries of the third world entered into a considerable number of negotiations designed to conclude with the signature of agreements for bilateral co-operation; but this practice did not produce the results expected. In the light of this co-operation and assistance, which consisted of supplementary assistance with, in most cases, an element of domination, and also in the face of the increasing gap between the developed and the developing countries, it was thought that international co-operation might be an unselfish and decisive factor in the progressive elimination of the economic backwardness of the developing countries. This initiative took shape through the creation of a dynamic body reflecting the fundamental objectives defined in the Charter of the United Nations: I refer to UNCTAD. Since it was set up, it has held three sessions. True, some decisions were taken in favor of the countries of the third world, but after the third session the feeling of frustration, far from declining, had, on the contrary, increased among the countries of the third world. Repeatedly the developed countries were seen to adopt a selfish attitude, and in particular the developing countries deplore the fact that they were not associated with the important negotiations which culminated in an international monetary reform. Moreover, the economic dis-parities continue to grow between the wealthy countries and the countries of the third world. The output of the developing countries has not expanded, and the income from exports needed for the industrialization of those countries has constantly suffered from a deep decline in the terms of trade and obstacles to trade between countries with different levels of development.\n273. The indifference that the rich countries display towards the development of the developing countries\nseriously endangers international peace and security. It weakens the fundamental objectives of the United Nations Charter, an Organization of which they are Members. It therefore weakens our Organization.\n274. The noble ideals defined in the Charter should not constitute mere words but should be dynamic and active statements. That is why my country thinks that in the International Development Strategy for the Second United\nNations Development Decade, adopted unanimously by the General Assembly on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the interests of the developing countries should inevitably be the subject of very special attention in any new world trade and monetary system. The wealthy countries should bow to this international imperative, without which any coexistence of the international community would be incompatible with the fundamental purposes of the Charter and thus would lead to a worsening of the international situation.\n275.\tThe recent firm positions taken by the developing countries at the third session of UNCTAD should have been sufficient evidence of the ripening of their awareness of their interests, which are attached by the developed countries. This energetic attitude of the developing countries must not leave the wealthy countries and international opinion unmoved if we want international peace and security to be preserved in the interests of all, and in the spirit of the United Nations Charter.\n276.\tEvery year bears a symbolic seal for our Organization. It is then that we are given an opportunity to reflect, to adopt resolutions and to begin on actions in accord with the theme that has been chosen. It is within this framework that the Secretary-General has told us that the year 1974 will be the Population Year.\n277.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo reserves the possibility of studying the subject in great depth and in due course to make known the results of those studies, based on its own real situation.\n278.\tBut as of this moment we consider that we are in a position to state that this theme should not be tackled with certain specific unduly rigid views in mind. Among these, we would emphasize the attitude which considers that the cure for world ills is to be found in limiting the earth's population. Certain countries may have reasons to feel that they are over-populated, That is not the case of Africa. Moreover, the concept of over-population is a relative one. It is determined on the basis of the country's development in all its aspects. A particular country of Europe or North America might have appeared to be over-populated in the eighteenth century with the population that it has in the twentieth century. Is not the real problem rather that of liberating the natural and human energies which each country possesses? These energies and wealth are as infinite as nature itself. By this I mean to say that the possibilities for life are limitless. There are still innumerable areas where man can conquer the wilderness and render it productive. The obstacles relate rather to relations between nations, and within nations to the relations between men, rather than to the number of human beings.\n279.\tI hope that the World Population Year, 1974, will not be a year of depopulation, for then it would have been directed against man, man whom our Charter considers as the supreme asset.\n280.\tThe Assembly has never been so sovereign and so representative as it has been since the historic year of 1971, which saw the long-expected arrival of China in our midst. Unfortunately despite this fact, its activities in the settlement of disputes which threaten or undermine a great part of our planet are still largely hamstrung, benefiting the diabolical machinations of colonialism and imperialism.\n281.\tOur vigilance and our activities should be redoubled in the interest of the lasting preservation of peace and the independence of nations.\n282.\tThe United Nations, by virtue of the noble task which devolves upon the Organization within the scheme of the Second Development Decade, should act in such a way as progressively to eliminate the regrettable disequilibrium in the distribution of the wealth of the world. It is almost a certainty today that no war will ravage Europe or North America. But it is equally obvious that the imperialist world will not hesitate to provoke or support slaughter in those vast areas which are the storage-houses of raw materials, and I refer to Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n283.\tMany good intentions are to be found in the professions of faith made by certain great Powers. The People's Republic of the Congo would hope, for its part, that behind these intentions there will be no hidden designs and that, adhering to the fundamental problems, we will avoid allowing ourselves to be seduced by the song of the siren chanting lofty sentiments which often conceal sordid interests.\n284.\tWe deliberately choose to close on this note.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of Cyprus takes particular pleasure in associating itself with the previous speakers who have extended congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This election is a just recognition of your great personal qualities and of your outstanding career, as well as of the important place that your country occupies in international affairs. I wish also to express our full confidence that, under your wise guidance, the deliberations of this session will lead to fruitful conclusions. May I on this occasion add my delegation's deep appreciation for the effective manner in which your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, carried out his functions during the past session.\n111.\tWe meet at a time when the political climate of the world shows the first definite signs of auspicious improvement. Two years ago, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the world outlook was rather dismal. The period since then has seen significant developments in international affairs and in the United Nations. Among the most important has been the progress achieved towards an East-West detente between the great Powers and the major achievement made in the direction of the universality of the\nUnited Nations when the People's Republic of China became represented in this Organization. That great country, with its rich heritage of the past and its enormous present-day potential, is already making its important contribution to the work of the Organization. Still a third signal event has been the successful outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June, which demonstrated world awareness of the implications of a new and vast' threat to human welfare and even human survival.\n112.\tThe East-West detente constitutes a bold move forward out of the negations of a long-standing cold war. It is reflected in recent developments, such as the ratification of the treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with both the Soviet Union and Poland. These should pave the way towards better East-West relations and facilitate the now more realistically contemplated European security conference. Within this context comes also the hopeful improvement of the relations between the two German States. In Asia also there have been noticeable accommodations: between North and South Korea; also on the subcontinent, with the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan, both renouncing the use of force in their bilateral relations; and more recently, the hopeful establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.\n113.\tThus what has been for many years an unchanging pattern of cold war, military confrontation and political recriminations has now entered a tentative period of contact and dialog offering the hope of more concrete results. This relaxation of tension, if continued, might be expected to create a new climate that would vitally improve the functioning of the United Nations and particularly the Security Council. As we all know, the failure of the Security Council to meet the requirements of the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security has been largely attributed to the absence of unanimity among the permanent members in the wake of the cold war. The present detente opens the possibility for better co-operation between the great Powers in the Security Council, which might lead to the desired unanimity on major issues as envisioned in the Charter. The road towards that goal may still be long and arduous, but the first important step appears to have been taken.\n114.\tThere seems to be, however, an apprehension, rightly or wrongly felt, that parallel to the detente a trend may grow towards co-operation among the great Powers outside the United Nations. The fear is that such co-operation may not strengthen this Organization in the solution of problems, but rather follow the pattern *of the nineteenth century Concert of Europe. We do not share this apprehension. Such retrograde development, ignoring the rest of the world, would run counter to the very spirit of our democratic times which, in an increasingly interdependent world, compellingly call for international organization. It would also be against the true interests of the big Powers themselves. Our belief is that an improved international climate would bring new vitality to the Security Council and strengthen the entire United Nations. This seems particularly necessary at a time when the effectiveness of the United Nations is most needed in order to cope with the immensity of new challenges that face the international community.\n115.\tYet there is a tendency in some parts of the world, as the Secretary-General remarks in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701[Add.l], to downgrade the United Nations and criticize the Organization too readily for any failures anywhere. It should not be overlooked, however, that the failures are not of the Organization as such; they are failures in commitment and obligation by the Member States. For the United Nations cannot possibly produce more than it is allowed to by its Members.\n116.\tThe Secretary-General, in his introduction, further observes that the United Nations \\\"plays a key role in the co-operative effort to tackle long-term social and economic problems, but in the political sphere the Organization's place is more uncertain\\\" [ibid., p. 1], and invites the earnest attention of all Member Governments to this vital question. The Secretary-General thus raises for discussion the important issue of the rule of the United Nations.\n117.\tThere can be little doubt that the political function of the United Nations is in some cases disregarded by Member States in the solutions of problems and even in the maintenance of peace. Hie United Nations, however, cannot be respected in some of its functions while ignored in others without its authority being undermined. Nor can it be downgraded, as the Secretary-General pertinently points out in his introduction, without dire consequences to the world community.\n118.\tThis is a reality and an intuitive appraisal that is deeply rooted in the conscience of the world's peoples. For, indeed, the overriding influence of the United Nations in international affairs is undeniable. All nations, large or small, whether Members of the Organization or not, strive to justify their international actions by picturing them as conforming to the Charter. We believe that any occasional attitudes of disregard of the United Nations are but a passing phase in a transitional period.\n119.\tIt may be recalled, in this connexion, that we are in an era of rapid change and that the United Nations finds itself in a period of transition from a traditional world of unlimited national sovereignty to a new world of effective international authority. A decisive move toward effecting such a transition has to be made. It is therefore obvious that the United Nations cannot remain static. We feel that it is the duty of all Members not only to uphold and strengthen the Organization morally and politically, but also to contribute to its dynamic development into a positive instrument for promoting change \\\"effectively, humanely and reasonably\\\" [ibid., p. 5], to quote the Secretary-General, so that the international community may meet the emerging new challenges and adapt itself to the growing needs of the times. Perhaps a hopeful sign in that direction is the positive outcome of the recent United NatiOTS Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, particularly in the sense of emphasizing the need for a reappraisal of old values and for a new global ethic.\n120.\tTurning now to the less positive side of the balance sheet in international developments during the period under review, we find conflict in several areas of the world still unresolved and still persisting. The situation in IndoChina continues to be one of intensified war, although certain developments, including high-level contacts between North Viet-Nam and the United States, offer some hopeful indications that a way to mutual accommodation may yet be found so that this devastating war may come to an end.\n121.\tThe Middle East situation shows hardly any signs of improvement. This is a complex problem aggravated by its emotional background and the intensity of feelings and constituting by far the gravest threat to world peace and security today. It merits the concerted and urgent effort of the international community to find an agreed accommodation. In our view, a solution can and should be found on the basis of the principles of the Charter and of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. If concrete steps could be taken towards even a partial accommodation, at least on the more urgent aspects of the problem, this would help to defuse the situation and open the way to a better understanding, leading towards an over-all solution of the basic problem. My delegation stands for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242(1967). This resolution, unanimously adopted and virtually accepted by all sides, provides the basis for a peaceful and just solution of the Middle East problem. Differences in respect of its interpretation can be overcome. For the resolution in its context is clear and unambiguous. We therefore express the hope that a reactivation of the mediation of Ambassador Jarring will achieve positive results in its next round.\n122.\tMy country, Cyprus, lying within the area and having friendly relations with all the parties, is particularly interested in a peaceful, just and sound solution of the Middle East problem in accordance with the tenets of justice and the principles of the Charter.\n123.\tI would now like to say a few words on the policy of Cyprus in the United Nations and on its own problem. Since its independence and admission to the United Nations in 1960, Cyprus as a Member State has constantly and on all occasions demonstrated its unswerving dedication to the principles of the Charter and its whole-hearted support of the Organization. As a small, non-aligned country free of any commitment to military power or political blocs, and relying on the United Nations for its freedom and security, its primary commitment has been and is to the United Nations and its Charter.\n124.\tAs to the problem of Cyprus, while it is not an item on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly, it falls fully within the purview of the United Nations through the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n125.\tI do not propose to enter into the merits of the case at this juncture. They are well known from the lengthy discussions in this august body and in the Security Council. They resulted in the relevant resolutions, General Assembly resolution 2077 (XX) and Security Council resolution 186 (1964)s which reaffirmed the sovereignty,, independence, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus; we firmly stand by these resolutions as the only sound basis for a solution. The reactivated and expanded bilateral talks, with the participation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the presence of constitutional experts from Greece and Turkey as provided in the formula of the former Secretary-General, U Thant, and put into application by the present Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim are currently taking place in a good atmosphere. We trust that, in a spirit of justice and mutual understanding, the provisions of a workable constitution for an independent and unitary Cypriot State will be worked out in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the aforesaid United Nations resolutions, in a manner ensuring a lasting solution on the positive basis of conciliation and co-operation.\n126.\tMy Government is determined to show all goodwill and explore all possibilities toward accommodation in that direction. However, constitutional provisions that create sharp distinctions and divisions among our people that, are, in whatever form, inconsistent with a unitary State and will inevitably lead to friction and conflict, will have to be carefully avoided. Thus, in a positive spirit of co-operation among its people, Cyprus may be able to become a link of unity in the world and not an arena of division and conflict. We confidently trust that in this task the Government and the people of Cyprus will have the unreserved support of all Members of this Organization.\n127.\tWe deeply appreciate the protection afforded by the United Nations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus at critical junctures and its contribution to the pacification of the island through a United Nations Peace-keeping Force, as well as its efforts toward normalization and a solution of the problem.\n128.\tWe express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General and his associates, both in New York and in Cyprus, for their dedicated and untiring efforts, which recently resulted in the reactivation of the local talks. Our thanks go also to the Commander of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus and his assistants for their devoted services. We are' grateful to the countries whose contributions in military personnel and financial assistance made possible the United Nations peace-keeping operation in Cyprus.\n129.\tA wide range of problems is on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. Old problems remain unsolved and new problems are added to them. I shall deal briefly with four main problem areas: peace and security, economic development, human rights, and environment.\n130.\tPeace and security have been and remain major urgent problems. In the prevailing conditions of radically changed methods of war, these are problems that particularly require a new approach. Because of the unlimited destructiveness of present-day weaponry, nations can no longer effectively provide for their own defense through armaments, or ensure their cities' safety from attack and total destruction. It has become increasingly obvious that real national security now depends upon international security through the development of the United Nations into an adequate instrument for the maintenance of international peace, as envisaged in the Charter.\n131.\tEfforts at disarmament over many decades without parallel efforts towards ensuring international security have proved fruitless. Disarmament cannot, therefore, be effectively promoted independently of progress in the peace-maintaining and peace-making functions of the United Nations. The provisions of the Charter contained in Chapter VII, which have remained practically dormant over the year, may possibly be in some way activated. Meanwhile in the present improved climate more effective efforts might be centered on the development of the existing peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, which have rendered most useful services to the cause of peace, around the world, including Cyprus. We hope that the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations will find it possible in the present improved climate to make further progress toward formulating guide-lines for such operations. These guide-lines should, however, be developed with a view to the goal of an organized system of a permanent United Nations peace force with direct allegiance to the Organization. The financial requirements might perhaps be met by the establishment of a special peace fund for the purpose.\n132.\tThe peace-making functions of the United Nations, on the other hand, also have to be given parallel attention. Article 33 of the Charter provides for the means of peaceful settlement of disputes, among which are negotiation, mediation, conciliation, arbitration and judicial decision, but, the modalities and machinery for the practical application of these means are still lacking. Such machinery, however, is indispensable if the means are to be practically applied. It is certainly true that, without the will to settle international disputes peacefully, the mere existence of the modalities will not act as magic, but their absence is nevertheless a major impediment to the peace-making progress of the United Nations. We therefore hope that this important aspect of the United Nations peace-making functions may be given equal consideration through the setting up by the General Assembly of a special committee or in some other manner.\n133.\tWithin this context falls the review of the role of the International Court of Justice, an item on our agenda [item 91]. My delegation will, as in the two previous sessions, support all efforts designed to render more effective the legal arm of the United Nations by its wider use on problems having a legal aspect.\n134.\tRegarding disarmament proper, the primary concern has been the spiraling arms race and the ever-continuing nuclear tests underground and in the atmosphere. The dangers to the world are obvious, and the psychological influence of this arms race, apart from the tremendous financial drain involved, also has to be reckoned with. We therefore warmly welcome the important accords reached between the super-Powers in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks which have at least arrested the momentum in the deployment of defensive strategic arms. While we fully appreciate the efforts made towards this positive result, we cannot overlook the fact that these accords have not affected in any significant respect the production and deployment of new and improved offensive strategic arms. Consequently the arms race, in effect, continues unabated, particularly in its qualitative aspect. It may be recalled that the world spends $200,000 million annually for weapons of war while to the institutions of peace and social progress less than 0.5 per cent of that amount is applied.\n135.\tWe hope that in the forthcoming second round of the Strategic Arras Limitation Talks there will be substantial steps towards the achievement of an effective halt in the arms race. We also hope that agreement among all the nuclear Powers will yield a long-delayed comprehensive test-ban treaty.\n136.\tRegarding a world disarmament conference, as pro-posed in resolution 2833 (XXVI) of the General Assembly, my Government fully supports the convening of such a conference, which we consider useful and desirable, provided it is open to all States and that it is attended by all major Powers. To be successful, such a conference will, no doubt, have to be carefully prepared not only procedurally, but also psychologically. Great hopes will be pinned on it as the last resort in the disarmament effort. It cannot, therefore, and should not fail in its main objectives.\n137.\tTurning to the problem of world economics and the growing disparity between the developing and the developed world, the recent disappointing reports indicate the pitifully low standard of living of millions of people, while the gap between the developed and the developing countries has widened further. World population statistics showing an increase by 340 million from 1965 to 1970 point out that by far the greatest rate of increase took place in the developing countries, so that 70 per cent of the world population now lives in the developing regions.\n138.\tThe adoption two years ago of an International Development Strategy for the 1970s [resolution 2626 (XXV)], will, we hope, make the Second United Nations Development Decade more successful than the first. Also, the recent third session of UNCTAD held in Santiago, despite its frustrations, has been wholesome in solidifying the wishes and will of the developing world. The discussion at that session of the link between development and disarmament emphasizes that only a 5 per cent shift from arms to development would make it possible to reach the target for official development assistance set by this Assembly.\n139.\tFrom another aspect, technological innovations have opened up the possibility of the exploration of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction for the benefit of all mankind. The General Assembly Declaration  has established this historical principle which, if finally implemented, could release resources from the depth of the sea that could diminish the scourge of poverty in the world and substantially help to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor countries. Here is indeed a new and vast economic potential for the international community which would allow it to solve so far intractable economic problems through the establishment of a world legal order for the first time in history over a part of this earth its marine expanse.\n140.\tIn the light of the encouraging results achieved at the recent Geneva session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, it is hoped that the Committee will continue its present positive work in a spirit of constructive consensus in order to achieve a successful conference on the law of the sea which would remedy the current unsettled situation in the relevant international law and make possible concrete results toward the goal of the eventual equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed for the benefit of all mankind.\n141.\tFrom the aspect of human rights, next year the world community will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is hoped that this will prove an important landmark in the quest for human rights, particularly having regard to the achievements recently made through the United Nations in that field, such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)] and the International Covenants on human rights. In this connexion, I may in all modesty mention that Cyprus had the honor of being one of the first to sign and ratify both these vital instruments for human rights.\n142.\tAlthough much progress has been made toward decolonization since the adoption of the epoch-making resolution for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], the continent of Africa is still suffering from the remnants of colonialism in Angola, Mozambique and other Portuguese territories and is burdened with apartheid in South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia.\n143.\tNamibia is at present the only area in which there seems to be a glimmer of hope for improvement as a result of the skillful diplomatic action of our Secretary-General. This slight crack in the door of Namibia must be further opened by continued and determined action through the United Nations.\n144.\tCyprus, having itself emerged from colonial rule, has all along supported fully the granting of independence to colonial countries, the ending of the abhorrent practices of apartheid and stands in full solidarity with all people still deprived of their inalienable rights of freedom, independence and human rights. Concerted efforts should be made to eliminate not only colonialism, but also neo-colonialism in many parts of the world. The recent decision taken by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1721 (LIII) to study the multinational corporations is a sound initiative.\n145.\tThe problem of the human environment, global in nature, preeminently reflects the necessity for effective global control. The winds and the waves have no national character, respect no national boundaries and respond to no national pleas. They carry pollution to the remotest corners of the earth. No people and no country, whatever its geographical situation, can be immune from the dire effects of the growing destruction of the environment. The interest, therefore, is common and the duties and responsibilities collective.\n146.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm made a most heartening beginning toward effectively tackling this planetary problem, which was hardly even contemplated a very few years ago. We take this opportunity to express once more our appreciation to the Government of Sweden for its original initiative and effort to bring about this Conference. In its results the Conference produced more than 100 recommendations in its Action Plan,  adopted a historic Declaration and recommended the establishment of a 54-nation governing council for environmental programs.  These accomplishment in Stockholm are welcome evidence not only of the resilience of this Organization, but also of the wisdom, persistence and dedication of the Conference's Secretary-General, Mr. Maurice Strong, to whom we wish to pay a lightly deserved tribute. We must not, however, merely extol the Stockholm Conference. We have to proceed in the same spirit of dedication to establish the governing council and give it the personnel and particularly the finances it requires.\n147.\tThe protection of the environment, involving as it does the very continuance of life on this globe, is a matter of such vital importance to all nations and people that no effort should be spared to obtain a consensus for appropriate measures to ensure that, while economic growth and development could proceed uninterruptedly, they would be closely co-ordinated with the adequate protection of the environment.\n148.\tIn any review of the world situation and its various problems, whether local or global, it emerges clearly that in the last analysis the only way toward their solution is through a strengthened, developed and effective United Nations. We therefore deeply appreciate the efforts of our Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, who, on the same lines as his predecessor, U Thant, is wholly dedicated to the cause of strengthening the United Nations so that it may become central to the solution of international problems and to global planning.\n149.\tWe wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Waldheim for his inspired leadership, his dynamism and his untiring efforts to impart vigor and effectiveness to the United Nations.\n150.\tIn this task Cyprus pledges itself to do all within its modest means to support the Secretary-General and to exert all efforts to make of the United Nations not only the effective international instrument for peace, justice and progress in the world that it was intended to be by the drafters of the Charter, but also the world authority to cope with the planetary challenge of survival with which mankind is now faced.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I take the greatest pleasure in expressing to you the heartfelt congratulations of the Austrian delegation on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We greet you as a personality of the highest professional and human qualifications and we also greet you as the representative of a country with which Austria maintains close ties through a policy of friendly understanding and an auspiciously developing co-operation. We are convinced that under your guidance this General Assembly will be successful in its work.\n45.\tI also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Adam Malik, President of last year's General Assembly, for the prudence and the skill with which he directed it.\n46.\tThe twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly has witnessed the termination of more than a decade of self-sacrificing endeavor on the part of a man whose term of office has coincided not only with one of the most active periods in world politics, but also with one of the most difficult phases in the history of the United Nations. The place U Thant has taken among the tireless protagonists in the cause of world peace is lasting and unshakable and we shall always be grateful to him. The Austrian delegation deems it particularly appropriate to pay a tribute to this historic achievement, as our delegation today has the special privilege-in full respect of Article 100 of the United Nations Charter to say how proud and happy Austria is to see an Austrian, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, holding the responsible post of Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n47.\tMr. Secretary-General, we offer you our greetings and wish you most sincerely every success in the service of the high ideals of the United Nations. We know your outstanding qualities and your dedication to the task entrusted to you. Accordingly, we look forward with confidence to your activities in your high office. The first nine months of your tenure entitle us fully to this expectation.\n48.\tMore than 100 ministers of foreign affairs, other members of Government, and even prime ministers have gathered in New York for this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This affords great opportunities for personal contacts. They are of great value. But personal contacts alone are not enough. The peoples of the world expect more. They expect us to come closer to the goal of peace and security in justice.\n49.\tThe Charter and several basic declarations of the General Assembly have defined the purposes and principles which should govern the life of the community of nations. Rather than only discussing them, we should apply them and apply them in good faith. The scientists of our generation have gained access to the universe. Why then should we, who carry political responsibility, and why should sociologists and humanists lag so far behind their counterparts in the exact sciences in their efforts to achieve peace and security in justice?\n50.\tWe are painfully aware of centers of crisis throughout the world and also of the danger they represent for peace in every other part of the world. Yet it seems to me that we can assess political developments since the last session of the General Assembly with some guarded optimism.\n51.\tThe President of the United States of America has visited China and the Soviet Union during the first half of this year. This highlighted the efforts by the three greatest Powers of the world to place their relationships on a new footing of trust and co-operation.\n52.\tAt the beginning of this week an agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States of America limiting their strategic weapons  has entered into force, and the two Governments have expressed their willingness to continue their efforts in this field.\n53.\tIn Europe we are witnessing a process aimed at detente and co-operation. The status of permanent neutrality has enabled Austria to make its contribution to this process as one of the first countries, more than a decade ago.\n54.\tThis year, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the ratification of the treaties concluded in 1970 between the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and the Soviet Union and Poland on the other gave a strong impetus to a reduction of tensions in Europe. We sincerely hoDe that the necessary prerequisites will be soon brought about to enable both German States to become Members of our world Organization.\n55.\tThe first preparatory phase for a conference on European security and co-operation now lies before us. Security presupposes a credible renunciation of force and the threat of force, credible for all States, large, medium- sized and small. It will therefore be the task of the conference to provide the appropriate basis for security in Europe.\n56.\tA step in this direction could be a treaty which would codify, in a legally binding and politically feasible way, the duties and rights of States and would set up machinery to ensure the peaceful settlement of disputes. Negotiations on a balanced reduction of military forces in Europe could become a good test of the effectiveness of detente actually achieved.\n57.\tComprehensive co-operation in Europe in the economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields and also in the field of human environment is of great significance for progress in these areas. It is of equally great significance for a better understanding between men. Co-operation thus promotes the relaxation of tensions and strengthens security.\n58.\tIn pursuing these thoughts, I fully realize that the solution of the problems existing in Europe would not by itself eliminate tension, warfare and injustice in other parts of the world. It may, however, be justified to assume that a solution of European problems in the spirit of the Charter would not fail to have its impact on other continents too. The whole world has suffered in the course of this century from the consequences of two wars which spread from Europe. Why, then, should the whole world not benefit from the consequences of a peaceful development in Europe? Thus, the Austrian Government, in contributing to the strengthening of security and co-operation in Europe, does so in the firm hope that such action will also serve to promote peaceful development in other parts of the world.\n59.\tAustria is a permanently neutral country. The concept of neutrality originates in the law of war. This, however, should not lead to the idea that a permanently neutral State needs the setting of war or international tension to play a part in the community of nations. On the contrary, my Government interprets neutrality as a means of preserving Austria's independence and, at the same time, as a stabilizing and peace-keeping element within the international community. What Austria can give to the world are works and values which can grow only in an atmosphere of peace. The objective of Austrian policy is the enhancement of the well-being of the individual. Humanitarian tasks form an integral part of the primary duties of a neutral State.\n60.\tRecent years have shown a strong trend towards acts of violence perpetrated at both the national and the international level. Terrorism has become a social and an international problem. We must be able to assess this development clearly. If acts of terror continue to increase in the future at the same rate as they did in the last years, then, a few years from now, we shall be faced with a situation which may not be called war in the proper sense of the term but which will none the less inflict all the scourges of war upon innocent people, the very scourges of war which the United Nations wanted to rule out forever.\n61.\tIn view of the very objectives and principles of its Charter, the United Nations will have to take a stand against terror. The time for such action is already late. The Federal Government of Austria has condemned and will continue to condemn terrorism. Austria itself has taken and will take all measures necessary to suppress and to eliminate terrorism. Moreover, Austria will support all measures serving this purpose on the international level. Hijacking, the taking of hostages and murder cannot be accepted as means of resolving social or international problems if the dignity of man as enshrined in the Charter is to be taken seriously.\n62.\tThe existence of terrorism should not, however, serve as an excuse to abstain from an earnest consideration of the social and international phenomena underlying such acts. Should v/e fail in our efforts to provide and make effective the peaceful means needed for the implementation of the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter and in the declarations and resolutions of the United Nations, our condemnation of terror will be devoid of success and even devoid of sincerity. The serious nature of the problem and the multitude of facets it involves can hardly be underestimated. The dignity of our world Organization would be best served if the treatment of the problem were to lead to a concerted search for a common goal, rather than to mutual charges and counter-charges.\n63.\tI said at the beginning that people throughout the world expect from us, who have gathered here, peace and security in justice. Peace and security alone may well satisfy a few of the \\\"haves\\\"-but not, at least, the \\\"have-nots\\\". They will also demand justice.\n64.\tThe demand for justice confronts us in a variety of contexts. In particular, I am thinking of the elimination of discrimination based on race, religion or other grounds, and, especially, the termination of the policy of apartheid. In this context, I wish to refer to the position taken by the Austrian delegation at all previous sessions of the General Assembly. My Government also welcomes the decisions adopted by the Security Council at its meetings held in Addis Ababa, particularly with reference to Namibia.\n65.\tThe demand for justice also centers on the solution of the economic and social problems in the developing countries. We all know, and my Government knows, that more has to be done both in respect of the substance and of the methods to be pursued. In the coming year Austria will greatly increase its official development assistance.\n66.\tIn this connexion, I should like to refer to the following considerations submitted by Austria at the annual meetings of the Board of Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, held jointly with that of the International Monetary Fund, which took place in Washington from 25 to 29 September 1972.\n67.\tA number of important international capital movements between the industrialized nations of Western Europe and North America have resulted in the accumulation of considerable amounts of United States dollars outside the United States. Careful consideration should be given to the possibility of using part of this \\\"overhang\\\" of United States dollars for low-cost development financing.\n68.\tMy Government is considering the purchase of United States dollars from the Austrian National Bank, our central bank, in order to offer these dollars as loans to international organizations which are concerned with development financing, such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. These loans would be made available at interest rates attractive to developing countries.\n69.\tIn my contribution to the general debate I have focused attention on only a few subjects. Other questions of equal importance have had to be left untouched, such as, for example, the question of disarmament, an area where Austria is ready to off\\\" constructive co-operation; and the question of the protection of the environment, which is basic to human life in the future. I also have not mentioned the crisis in the Middle East. Austria's position in this matter is well known and was extensively explained both from this rostrum and during official visits to Israel and Egypt. Austria believes in the continued usefulness of the Jarring mission.\n70.\tFor 10 years now, at every session of the General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria has reported on the question of South Tyrol, which was the subject-matter of resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) by which Austria and Italy were urged to find a solution for all differences through negotiation. Two years ago I could report to the General Assembly that after nine years of effort the two States had agreed on a proposal for a solution which contained provisions for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol and a relevant time-table agreed to by both States [see 1855th meeting, paras. 169-174].\n71.\tI am happy to be able to state that the implementation of the proposal for a settlement of this question has made further progress since the last session of the General Assembly. Thus, the constitutional law on the extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol came into effect on 20 January 1972. In April of this year, a large part of the ordinary laws provided for in addition to the constitutional law also entered into effect; a certain part is still pending.\n72.\tI wish to express the hope that the development now in progress will continue to advance further in a satisfactory way on the basis of the implementation, in letter and in spirit, of the still-outstanding measures in South Tyrol, and of an understanding attitude on the part of the Italian Government towards the needs of the South Tyrolean ethnic group, which, in turn, will lead to an even better relationship between the two neighboring countries.\n73.\tPermit me to go back to the beginning of my statement. I said that the establishment of peace and security based on justice is the aim the peoples of the world expect us to achieve. This expectation coincides with the aims and purposes of the United Nations. The United Nations is not just an organization in New York, far from our home countries. We ourselves are the United Nations, first as Member States, but also as human beings for whose sake this Organization was created, as individuals-members of nations, of religious denominations, of political parties, of majorities and minorities, of the affluent and of the needy. We must strive to make peace and security based on justice a reality in each and every one of these, our capacities. We should not be judges one over the other, one State over another State. To this we have no right, but we do have the duty to unite our energies to achieve peace and security injustice.\n"

        "file_text": "History shows that man cannot and should not live alone. Accordingly, since the most remote times of history up until the present day he has persistently tried to become integrated with and to seek a full measure of development within various social nuclei. These efforts were manifested, first, within the family the essential cell of any human community, then within the tribe, later in towns and finally within the State, which is the most comprehensive social organization.\n67.\tNeither can States live alone. They need to join with others for progress and mutual protection. Although sometimes imperfect and at other times not a complete success, interstate association is required if human beings are to coexist in today's world. That explains why the establishment of the United Nations was not merely a reflection of a feeling of brotherhood but was rather the satisfaction of a great need to develop the international community.\n68.\tThe elimination of any act designed to stand in the way of the true union of States is a continuing task to which this world Organization must devote its best efforts. Accordingly, war or ambition for hegemony, as well as economic domination by those with material power, when exercised to the detriment of the fair development of the materially weak, are disturbing elements which must be removed.\n69.\tFreedom, for which millions of human beings have laid down their lives in the course of history, of necessity implies strict respect for human dignity and faithful observance of the legal equality of States. Accordingly, we should always try in our work to ensure that these basic tenets of the San Francisco Charter become general rules which are put into practice and are universally observed.\n70.\tMr. President, we know that you were elected because of your impartiality and efficiency, which you have displayed on more than one occasion in your conduct of our debates. We offer you sincere congratulations.\n71.\tI should like to convey to the Secretary-General, in addition to our high esteem for his meritorious efforts, the gratitude of my country for having appointed a distinguished Mexican, Mr. Antonio Carrillo Flores, as Secretary- General of the United Nations World Population Conference, which is scheduled to be held in 1974. The population explosion is already a problem which it is urgent to solve and it is a fact of life which commands our utmost attention. As it is a multifaceted issue which has an impact in the educational, political, social and economic fields, it requires the broadest possible approach, subject always to the policy and program which all our peoples have adopted in the exercise of their sovereignty.\n72.\tWhenever we come together we must, albeit briefly, review the most salient international developments. This year the situation in Central Europe has stabilized, and the efforts of the two largest world Powers to normalize, consolidate and strengthen their relations in all areas have begun to yield gratifying results. It might be said that their mere coexistence, based on a respective capacity for nuclear deterrence, is tending to be transformed into active co-operation between these Powers.\n73.\tWe should all welcome the understandings reached, particularly when they diminish the risks of a nuclear confrontation which would engulf mankind. None the less, there are clouds on the horizon if we look in the direction of the third world.\n74.\tThe absurd desire to divide the earth into zones of influence or hegemony is not the best approach to international coexistence. Thus, despite ideological divergences among the great Powers, upon occasion' there has emerged a certain identity or at least a similarity of interests with respect to their positions vis-a-vis the third world. When this has occurred their common stand tends to preserve the status quo, which certainly has not proved to be favorable to the non-aligned countries. Thus, during the last few years we have noticed a decline in the financial assistance provided by these Powers to the developing countries. In other areas the positions of these great Powers have also come so close together that they nearly represent a common front vis-a-vis the majority of the countries of the third world; this occurs with respect to the law of the sea and disarmament, where they have only looked after their own interests and have frequently paid little heed to the wishes of almost all other States.\n75.\tAs the President of Mexico so aptly put it in addressing the United States Congress recently, we cannot reduce world policy to contacts between the powerful countries, since anything that affects those countries in the final analysis affects all of us. Genuine universal peace, in addition to an understanding between the powerful States, requires the active participation by all members of the international community in a strengthened system of collective security. Accordingly, we believe that we should improve and institutionalize the representation of the third world in international political organs. Later in this statement we will give our ideas on that subject.\n76.\tWith respect to continuing efforts within the United Nations to halt the nuclear arms race and to eliminate other weapons of mass destruction, the balance sheet for 1972 could not be more discouraging. As clearly emerges from the last report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament [A/8818], that body in its most recent meetings did not achieve the slightest bit of progress on any of the items it was dealing with.\n77.\tThe bogging down of work to bring about the total elimination of chemical weapons, which was the subject of three General Assembly resolutions at its last session, is doubly regrettable, as it may jeopardize the convention that had already been agreed upon for the elimination of biological weapons.\n78.\tA similar situation exists with respect to nuclear weapon tests which, on the initiative of the Mexican delegation, th<; General Assembly once again last year emphatically and unreservedly condemned for the second time [resolution 2828 A (XXVI)]. However, not only have such practices continued, but there has been an increase in underground testing, a situation which, apart from endangering the health of present and future generations, will inevitably lead, if those tests are continued, to the crumbling of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], which was concluded only after arduous efforts.\n79.\tThe negative results of the work done in Geneva confirm our belief that we must without delay strengthen the system which the United Nations has to fulfil the obligations entrusted to it under the Charter in the field of disarmament. It would appear necessary for both the negotiating body, with its headquarters at Geneva, and the other deliberative bodies available to the United Nations for disarmament to be substantially strengthened and their performance brought into line with the basic principle of the sovereign equality of States.\n80.\tWe should as a matter of urgency begin preparatory work on the convening of the World Disarmament Conference wherein all peoples and Governments will have an appropriate forum, a rostrum from which the voices of reason, anguish, impatience and indignation can be heard.\n81.\tIt is encouraging that there has been no break in the growth of the nuclear free zone established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco). During the current year the number of States parties to the Treaty has risen to 18 as a result of the ratification deposited by Colombia. The Latin American nuclear-free zone today covers an area of some 8 million square kilometers and has a population in excess of 140 million people. With respect to Additional Protocol II to the Treaty, the purpose of which is to ensure that the Treaty's provisions should be fully respected by the nuclear Powers, it would appear appropriate to recall that in the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States of Mexico and the People's Republic of China [see A/8818, annex 13, sect. 2], the latter Government stated that it supported the just position of Mexico and other Latin American States on the establishment of a Latin American nuclear-free zone and that all States possessing such weapons should assume the obligation not to employ them against the Latin American States. We interpret that statement as a promising sign that we can look forward to the valuable co-operation in the near future of the People's Republic of China with the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would be signified by its signing and ratifying Additional Protocol II, a position which we believe should also be taken by other States which possess nuclear weapons but which have not yet subscribed to that document.\n82.\tIn Mexico City the work of the sixteenth session of The General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which began last 26 September, will come to a close very shortly. My country has had the honor to be the host of that Conference, which has considered items of great concern to all mankind. At that Conference Mexico has reiterated its deep interest in having the constant progress of nuclear science help to improve our standards of living and not contribute to the production of weapons which threaten our very existence. The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is and will continue to be the constant goal of Mexico. As was so well said by President Echeverria in his opening speech at the Conference, we believe that the word \\\"atom\\\" should not be linked to the idea of death, but to the idea of a power capable of improving the conditions of human life.\n83.\tThe Secretary-General expressed his concern over the use of means of warfare which have particularly cruel, devastating and indiscriminate effects, when he emphasized in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the moral responsibility which he bears \\\"does not allow him to turn a blind eye when innocent civilian lives are placed in jeopardy on a large scale\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 4].\n84.\tMexico entirely agrees with that position. Accordingly, it was one of the first to offer its modest co-' operation through the appointment of a Mexican governmental adviser to help prepare the report which the General Assembly requested of the Secretary-General in its resolution 2852 (XXVI) [A/8781 and Corr.l], which was intended, as the title indicates, to promote respect for human rights during armed conflicts, and in which the Assembly emphasized its deep concern over the \\\"terrible suffering that armed conflicts continue to inflict upon combatants and civilians, particularly through the use of cruel means and methods of warfare and through inadequate restraints in defining military objectives\\\". We trust that that report, which the Assembly will b: considering at its current session, will contribute to the realization of that noble and pressing objective.\n85.\tIt seems appropriate to us that the item on international terrorism should have been included on the agenda of this session [item 92]. Barbarous acts like these merit punishment and the condemnation of all peoples, regardless of the ideological system under which one attempts to conceal them.\n86.\tIn 1970 Mexico defined terrorist acts in its penal laws. Furthermore, within the system of the Organization of American States, we attended in February 1971 a meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization which had been convened in Washington for that very purpose, and we signed the final document adopted by the Council.\n87.\tDespite our determination to repress acts which are in themselves abominable, we stated then, and we should like to repeat now, our concern to ensure that the instruments on this question that are prepared should not infringe or limit in any way the right of territorial or diplomatic asylum, which is so deeply rooted in the traditions of the countries of Latin America. It is also necessary that the definition of terrorism should be worked out with the utmost caution, in order to avoid its serving as a pretext to restrict or suppress individual freedoms or to limit the exercise of the right of self-determination of those peoples which are still subject to colonialism. Lastly, it seems essential to us that the determination of terrorist acts should always be the responsibility of the State in whose territory those acts have occurred, inasmuch as only in this way can we avoid violations of the State's sovereignty. On those conditions, we are prepared to enter into a dialog in this international forum and provide our unstinting co-operation in a study of measures that appear advisable to bring about the elimination of international terrorism.\n88.\tWe are still convinced that one of the fundamental tasks of the United Nations continues to be the proper and complete application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. It is incredible, in the opinion of my country, that in this space age in which we live, we should still be debating this item and placing it exclusively within a political framework, which has long since been superseded, as indeed it should be; it is high time that we now deal with the other form of colonialism which is equally ominous, and I refer to economic colonialism.\n89.\tAbsolute decolonization, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration, solemnly proclaimed in 1960, and the elimination of the remnants of colonialism in all of its forms and manifestations are essential prerequisites if developing States are to be able fully to exercise their economic rights in the international arena.\n90.\tThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National\nJurisdiction has made progress which in our opinion gives grounds for the hope that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea may start on the substantive portion of its work in 1974. Indeed, after two years of arduous and sometimes frustrating negotiations, the list of topics and issues to serve as the framework of the study and approval of the various articles to be induced in the instrument or instruments to be adopted by the Conference was finally adopted.\n91. With respect to the priorities that should be assigned to the consideration of the items, it would be well to make an effort to reconcile the various approaches that have been expressed on this point, starting from the fact-which is already obvious at this stage-that :t will be necessary to preserve and always bear in mind the unity of the various branches of law which come under the law of the sea. If this premise is accepted, it seems to us that we could easily avoid the procedural obstacle of discussing a pre-established order for the presentation of proposals on any of the topics and issues included in the list already approved.\n, 92. Apart from the concept, which is steadily gaining ground, of a 12-mile-wide territorial sea, Mexico recently 'spoke out in favor of the universal recognition of the coastal State's right to exercise jurisdiction over a zone whose maximum width should not exceed 200 miles. In that zone, for which we are in favor of the term \\\"patrimonial sea\\\", the coastal State would be entitled to exploit and explore resources for the benefit of its people, without this signifying that we are thinking of establishing limitations on the laying of under-water cables, navigation or over-flight by other States.\n93.\tLast June we participated, together with other countries of the Caribbean region, in the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea, convened by the Government of the Dominican Republic. There we supported and clearly defined the characteristic features which, in our opinion, should be contained in the thesis of the patrimonial sea. The Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721, annex I sect. 2] took up this theory, which we very much hope will eventually become, after the changes and additions to be agreed upon by common accord, a formula encompassing all of the States of Latin America.\n94.\tUnquestionably, one of the most important international events which have occurred under the auspices of the United Nations was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which took place in the capital of Sweden also in June of this year. The preservation of the human environment is the responsibility of all States. Those that because of their degree of development have contributed the most to the deterioration of the environment should assume greater technical and financial responsibilities for the establishment of corrective machinery.\n95.\tThus, it is the duty of all States to see to it that pollution caused by activities within their jurisdiction or under their control should not go beyond national boundaries, and also to provide compensation for the damage caused, Mexico has been the victim of non-compliance with this equitable and common-sensical rule, which should be accepted by all on a bilateral as well as multilateral basis.\n96.\tNo policy for the preservation of the human environment adopted by the international community should impede the development effort of the non-industrialized countries.\n97.\tIn our opinion, the foregoing should appear first and among the fundamental rules which we hope will be adopted at the second United Nations conference on the human environment, which we would hope would be convened in 1975, with the active participation of all States. Because of the benefits of such a conference for mankind and because of the importance that my country attributes to the protection of the national environment, as is shown by the especially significant legislative and practical measures it has adopted to prevent pollution, Mexico has announced that it would be pleased to have the second conference held in our capital. We repeat now this cordial and sincere invitation.\n98.\tAs is well known, a great deal of the extraordinary economic and social progress registered in recent decades is the result of advances in science and, more specifically, the application of scientific knowledge to technology investments and, in general, production processes. However, every day the gap between the technological achievements of the more advanced and the less developed countries is growing.\n99.\tAccordingly, the developed countries are duty bound to support without reservation the preparation of an international program designed to promote the transfer of appropriate technology to *he developing countries including, inter alia, the revision of international agreements on patents, the conclusion of agreements or conventions required to facilitate, in permanent and favorable conditions, the access of developing countries to patented and non-patented technology and the adaption of measures designed to promote those countries own technology.\n100.\tAt the outset of this statement we expressed our conviction that we should improve and institutionalize the participation of the third world in the system of collective security of the Unite ' Nations, and we would venture to put forward now a few specific ideas on this point.\n101.\tEver since 1945, when our Organization was created at the San Francisco Conference, Mexico has advanced serious reservations on the system adopted for the membership and the voting procedure of the Security Council, that organ to which the Charter has entrusted primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Since the amendment which we proposed at that time in the appropriate Committee of the Conference  was not adopted, Mexico stated for the record that it had decided to accept the text of Article 23 of the Charter because it interpreted that Article as an implicit application of the rule of law that there is a connection between powers and obligations which leaves intact the basic principles of the equal rights of all States.  \n102.\tNo delegation came forward to object to this interpretation of ours, which, for that matter, had a solid foundation in numerous official declarations made by the Heads of State of the Powers that participated in the Dumbarton Oaks talks. Thus, we wish now to propose in this forum that we should include in the Security Council at least one representative of the third world with the status of a permanent member of the Council and given the same powers as are enjoyed by the five permanent members now on the Council.\n103.\tOur proposal has the same logical, legal and political basis which we expounded in San Francisco in explaining our acceptance of the privileged position that the five permanent members of the Council have been enjoying through the years. We think that since that time a new fact has emerged which would more than justify the idea that we should immediately accept this proposal, that is, the emergence of a third world, which was practically nonexistent in San Francisco but which today makes up the largest group of States Members of our Organization. If, taken in isolation, the countries of the third world cannot hope to be counted either among the most wealthy or the most powerful, taken together they represent, beyond question, one of the most forceful elements in the United Nations. It is t!iis moral force\u2014this force which they have by virtue of being spokesmen for about two thirds of the world's population and frequently the champions of the principles of the Charter-which gives us grounds for asserting that they have a capacity to contribute to the maintenance of peace equal to or even greater than that of some of the States that have been sitting as permanent members. That is why, I repeat, we are convinced that it would be entirely just and, furthermore, of great benefit to the Organization if the third world had a permanent representative in the Security Council.\n104.\tPeace is not merely the absence of war; it is rather the implementation of measures necessary for the socioeconomic progress of nations. Peace will not be complete as long as some live in abundance and many others subsist in poverty. Peace is one of the natural consequences of the exercise of freedom, at all levels and in all realms. However, as was already said by a famous English liberal: \\\"Liberty is subject to control, and he who controls conditions controls freedom.\\\" In our times, as long as some have a monopoly on the world's economic elements, they will control in varying degrees the freedom of the rest.\n105.\tAn examination of the world economic situation shows definitely that the policy of the developed countries is departing every day more and more from the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)}. International co-operation has reached its lowest point since the United Nations was established, and the growing social and economic abyss that divides the developed from the developing States poses today one of the most serious threats to world peace. The alarming picture that we are confronted with makes it of pressing urgency to ensure that the principle of the juridical equality of States ceases to be a Utopian arrangement devoid of any real content and that international economic co-operation should not be viewed in terms of goodwill but should rather enter fully into the field of law so that the prevalent inequality in the world may be diminished and we can bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth.\n106.\tThat is why the President of Mexico proposed, during the third session of UNCTAD, that there should be drawn up a charter of the economic rights and duties of States which would be complementary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and an appropriate means for bringing about an atmosphere of social equity which would promote the full flowering of all human beings. \n107.\tThe development of nations is both a duty and a right, and access to the benefits of scientific progress, the application of technology, the development of natural resources and the promotion of foreign trade and financial co-operation are continuing prerogatives of mankind. All States are in duty bound to carry out a foreign and domestic policy designed to accelerate the balanced economic growth of the world as a whole and, in particular, to foster in the developing countries a rate of growth consistent with the need to achieve a substantial and continuing increase in the average income, in order to reduce the vast difference which exists between the standard of living in the developing countries and that obtaining in the developed countries and to create an atmosphere which will guarantee social justice. The developed countries will have to apply to the developing countries generalized, non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory preferential treatment with respect to all goods which may be objects of trade.\n108.\tWe should draw a precise distinction between those natural resources, be they on land or in the sea, which belong to a State and which that State therefore enjoys the sovereign right to make free use of in order to promote the economic development and well-being of its people and those resources which constitute the common heritage of mankind, be they in the sea or in outer space, the exploration and exploitation of which should be carried out for the benefit of mankind.\n109.\tI have set forth some of the key ideas which, in the opinion of my country, should govern economic relations among States. We are gratified that Mexico's initiative has met with enthusiastic support from the developing countries and is also supported by some highly developed and industrialized countries. We have already established the procedures that should be followed in the elaboration of the draft charter of the economic rights and duties of States, which we hope can be submitted for the consideration of the General Assembly at its next session.\n110.\tA document of universal legal validity such as the one Mexico has suggested to the community of nations will test the readiness of the powerful countries to put into practice true international solidarity which, resting on the principles of the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples, and governed by binding legal rules, could become the best instrument to achieve and consolidate stable and lasting peace.\n111.\tAs we have already stated, neither man nor the State can live alone.\n112.\tWithout further delay we must end the arms race. We must severely punish those who use human lives as a means of political extortion. We must put an end to colonialism, draw up regulations for the equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea, improve our environment, and use science and technology for the harmonious development of all peoples. We must provide permanent representation for the third world in the maintenance of peace and security. We must reduce the vast gap between the overwhelmingly wealthy and the bitterly poor by adopting a rule of general application clearly establishing the economic rights and duties of States.\n113.\tUnless these tasks are fulfilled our planet earth will be converted into a piece of the cosmos pursuing its eternal course forever in solitude.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by those before me and to offer my congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office is an eloquent tribute not only to your great country, Poland, but also to your eminent personal qualities of statesmanship, which make you highly qualified for this high office. The task before us is a heavy and a responsible one. As you have eloquently stated, we are meeting at a time when \\\"signs of a good augury have appeared on the international horizon\\\" [2032nd meeting, para. 30]. Despite these encouraging signs there are still great problems facing us at this session. I am more than certain, however, that with your wise guidance the deliberations of this Assembly will be conducted briskly and effectively. Indeed, Mr. President, you have already set the tone and the tenor of our deliberations by your inspiring address at the opening of the session. May I therefore assure you of my delegation's utmost co-operation in the execution of your task.\n36.\tI would like to take the opportunity here of expressing, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, our warm admiration and great appreciation to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Adam Malik, whose patience, wisdom and statesmanship guided the historic twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. The admirable manner in which Mr. Malik had conducted that difficult and historic twenty- sixth session is, indeed, a clear reflection of his qualities of statesmanship and leadership. I would just like to add that his untiring efforts and dedication to work towards peace, stability and progress in the region of South-East Asia exemplify further this quality of leadership of which Indonesia in particular and we in South-East Asia in general are justly proud.\n37.\tMay I also extend on behalf of my delegation our tribute to the Secretary-General, for whom this General Assembly session is his first full session since taking office. Mr. Waldheim, as we all known, is not new to the United Nations. His vast experience with this Organization should enable him to serve in his office with distinction. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to wish him every success in the execution of his immense task and to pledge our fullest co-operation with him in the performance of his duties and responsibilities.\n38.\tWe meet today in a world that is fast changing- changing amidst the visible signs of detente and reconciliation that have emboldened us to hope and believe that we are moving to a more stable order, and if I may add, to the beginning of a sober and rational international world order based on peace and co-operation.\n39.\tPerhaps the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly was the turning-point. In the General Assembly at its last session and in this very hall we witnessed the seating of the People's Republic of China. And then, in quick succession, we witnessed the visit of the President of the United States of America to the People's Republic of China and, subsequently, to the\\\" Soviet Union. The Shanghai communique of 27 February 1972 and the declaration entitled \\\"Basic Principles of Relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\\\" issued on 29 May 1972, at the end of the Moscow summit, had at once given us encouragement in our belief that we are indeed moving from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations, accommodation and of peaceful coexistence. This is indeed an encouraging and powerful trend, which holds the promise of a bright future for us and the generations after us.\n40.\tBut, as we are caught up in this general excitement, let us not be led into a state of over-optimism. Encouraged as we are, we are also aware that this trend could very well lead us into an era of big-Power collusion in which there would exist a multi-polar world broken up into spheres of influence and in which the fate of the smaller countries are decided not by themselves but by others. What we would like to see and what we seek is a non-polar world where universality of action and the process of democratization of the conduct of international relations prevail.\n41.\tI do not want to sound pessimistic or over-optimistic, but the trend towards detente between and among the big Powers is certainly an important and encouraging one, encouraging because we see today that it is not impossible to resolve outstanding problems through consultations and negotiations. For the present the impact of this important and noteworthy aspect of the trend, however, is a healthy one and is already being felt throughout the world. I refer to the renewed efforts for the relaxation of tension between East and West Europe. Then there are the agreements to limit the stock of nuclear armaments and other logistic weapons signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, which no doubt have far-reaching implications, leading us to hope that the end of the armaments race is not too far ahead.\n42.\tOf closer interest to us in Asia is the Simla Agreement reached between India and Pakistan, an understanding which, we hope, will move towards eliminating antagonism and confrontation from the Indian subcontinent.\n43.\tAnd while on the subject of the Indian subcontinent, if I may be allowed a little deviation, that one of the problems which confront us is the acceptance of Bangladesh by the United Nations. We hope that at this session the principle of universality will be upheld and the problems in the way of Bangladesh's admission into the United Nations and into the world community will be overcome.\n44.\tWe welcomed and were also encouraged by the initial contacts made between North Korea and South Korea, and the Joint Communique issued on 4 July 1972 [A/8727, annex I] bears testimony to their desire to work towards the peaceful settlement of the problem in that important area.\n45.\tFurther, while I am addressing this Assembly, another historic occasion in this chain of events is taking place. I refer to the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan to China which, we hope, will begin a new era in the relationship between the two countries and which will have far-reaching and, we hope, beneficial effects, particularly in our region of South-East Asia.\n46.\tWe see that bilateral contacts and dialog are already becoming accepted as one of the high points in our search for peace and stability, and it is the hope of my delegation that this significant trend will continue in the future. While we are concerned, and continue to concern ourselves, with problems that remain unsolved, problems that tend to endanger international peace and security, we should not, however, allow ourselves any action that would jeopardize efforts made by those concerned to solve their problems by themselves. Indeed, the only action that we may allow ourselves is that which would encourage further the present trend towards bilateral talks and negotiations.\n47.\tThe Government of Malaysia therefore welcomes this present development of the international scene. It is particularly meaningful to us in Malaysia and all the countries of South-East Asia.\n48.\tI need not remind the Assembly that there is a tragic and devastating war raging in parts of South-East Asia. We in South-East Asia have been living with this war for over two decades. A generation has grown up in our parts for whom war has been accepted as the natural order of things and peace has been a complete stranger. However, we are not sitting idly. Encouraged by the present trend in international relations, we are ourselves working to speed the wheels of change towards peace in our area and are making proposals with the object of bringing about lasting peace and stability within our region.\n49.\tYou will recall that at the last session of the General Assembly my Prime Minister had at some length discussed the proposal for the neutralization of South-East Asia [1948th meeting]. Since that time Malaysia, in association with its neighbors the Kingdom of Thailand, the Republic of the Philippines, the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Singapore have worked closely towards bringing into reality the ideals and aspirations of this purpose.\n50.\tOur determination and resolve in this endeavor finds its fullest expression in the Declaration issued by the meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN], held at Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971. in which the five countries of the region declared their determination \\\"to exert initially necessary efforts to secure the recognition of, and respect for, South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers\\\".  By this modest beginning the five States of South-East Asia have, for the first time in recent years, boldly and imaginatively sought, through their own efforts, to bring home the ever-elusive dove of peace to our peoples. Whether our efforts will be reduced to nothing more than just an eternally dim and flickering hope or whether they become a catalyzing agent ushering in a peaceful era for South-East Asia depends to a very great extent on the willingness and resourcefulness with which we in the region grasp the full significance of this singularly unique opportunity, which the present pervasive climate of peaceful dialog and detente affords us, to initiate immediate and positive actions for our own security and well-being. The proposal for the neutralization of South-East Asia demonstrates the recognition by the States of South-East Asia of the importance which such an opportunity affords them for the creation of a viable and efficacious security arrangement for the region. It is an eloquent testimony of their strong involvement in the world-wide efforts towards creating the conditions for a better and more peaceful world and reflects our optimism and faith in this new world order which has yet to blossom to its fullest extent. We are secure in the thought that our proposal, which is so much in harmony with the spirit and the ideals which have motivated the many historic and epochal events of our time, will find easy acceptance and recognition by everyone who shares and cherishes these values.\n51.\tIn pursuance of the provisions of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration efforts have been and are being made to bring its contents to the attention of the non-signatory States of South-East Asia and to encourage them to associate themselves with the aspirations and objectives expressed therein. Initially a committee of senior officials of the countries members of ASEAN was appointed to study and consider what further necessary steps should be taken to bring about the realization of their objectives. The committee has already had its first meeting and will continue its studies with further meetings in future. Since the signing of the Declaration, the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN countries have met on several occasions for mutual discussion and an exchange of views on matters affecting the region. And it was at the last of such meetings, which was held in Manila from 14 to 16 July 1971, that the ASEAN countries agreed to request the Foreign Minister of Indonesia to take certain initiatives on their behalf which we hope could contribute towards a peaceful and durable solution to the conflict in Indochina.\n52.\tAll these initiatives that we in South-East Asia are at the moment undertaking could not have been possible had there not existed today a sense of regionalism, political cohesion and solidarity. The desire to co-operate in matters of common concern and to consult with each other and the need to work towards a common objective have been manifested in the formation of ASEAN, a regional organization indigenously initiated and inspired.\n53.\tThrough the co-operative and joint actions that I have exemplified we hope to create conditions for the attainment of peace and stability. Because in the final analysis international security is the sum total of the prospect for peace and security in each and every country, each and every region. Hie trend towards detente has therefore a considerable effect on us. Indeed we believe that the move towards detente should not be the monopoly of the super-Powers alone. It should be the property of us all who set high in value the attainment of global peace and stability.\n54.\tWhile noteworthy and important developments are taking place on the political front, it is dismaying to find that this is not matched in the field of economic and social development. The picture we get here is one of gloom and pessimism. The world is still divided between the developing and developed countries. In this respect, it is still very much a bipolar world. Owing to the vast strides made by the developed countries in the technological and industrial fields the developed countries are far ahead of the developing countries and the gulf between them is ever widening. It is becoming increasingly clear, that the burden of the world's poverty is increasing rather than declining. Such a situation will not promote peace and stability, unless it be accompanied by economic and social progress as well.\n55.\tThe subject I am referring to is not a new one. It has been raised and will continue to be raised at every opportunity not only to demonstrate our concern and anxiety but also to bring home the point that such an unbalanced international growth will not be conducive to a stable world order. We therefore cannot continue to be apathetic or unresponsive to problems of the developing world, which is still facing mass poverty, unemployment and illiteracy -problems which appear to be intractable although we are now in the Second Development Decade. In addition to these problems, we are threatened by growing trade protectionism, when there is a need for expanding markets for the primary products and manufactures of developing countries, signifying the reluctance of richer nations to help the poorer. This reluctance has been reflected in the falling off of official development assistance to developing countries, thereby increasing their debt- servicing problems, which are becoming crucial, and it strikes at their national efforts for greater income distribution and the alleviation of poverty and mass unemployment.\n56.\tThe third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, held at Santiago in April and May 1972, was characterized by the unwillingness of the richer countries to face up to these problems and to commit themselves to the attainment of the aid targets laid down in the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)J, both in respect of the 1 per cent of gross national product volume target by each economically advanced country and in official development assistance flows of 0.7 per cent of gross national national product, which are now almost less than half their stated target. One of the goals and objectives of the Second Development Decade is the attainment of a 6 per cent average annual rate of growth in the gross product of the developing countries as a whole. However, this growth rate cannot be achieved if official development assistance continues to decline. I might point out here that three quarters of the world's resources go to one quarter of the world's population where per capital income income averages $US 1,000.\n57.\tIt might be appropriate to recall resolution 2880 (XXVI), on the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, which emphasizes the close connexion between the strengthening of international security and development and which calls on the United Nations to evolve a. concept of collective economic security designed to promote the sustained development and expansion of national economies.\n58.\tIn this context, in the interests of both the developed and the developing worlds, we look forward to a greater liberalization of trade, since that would accelerate expansion of international trade to the mutual benefit of the developed and developing nations. Only in this way -by a collective effort on the part of both developed and developing nations- can we all tread the path to collective economic security called for in resolution 2880 (XXVI). We are living in an interdependent world where what affects one affects the other. For the developed as well as the developing countries, the interest is mutual and the stake is common. If it has been possible to improve the political climate of the world after years of antagonism and mistrust, it is surely timely now for us to take stock of the economic scene and to look forward to an era of greater and more meaningful international economic co-operation between the developed and the developing worlds.\n59.\tWhat is needed here is the political will on the part of the developed countries to come to the assistance of the developing countries, for their assistance is crucial in the International Development Strategy. I would not like to give the impression that the developing countries are seeking charity from the developed countries. What we are trying to achieve is the bringing about of a sound investment in global peace and progress consonant with the views and ideals of the United Nations Charter.\n60.\tThat we have arrived at an era of reconciliation and accommodation is timely as we have spent time long enough to arrive at an attitude of mind that we have today. Although we anticipate far-reaching consequences, I do not at this somewhat early stage entertain visions of a profound and immediate change for peace. For in the behavior of nations, as in man, antagonism, rivalries and competition will continue to remain a feature of life. What we must do is to blunt these features and minimize the threat to international peace and security. At the same time, I do not, however, minimize the golden opportunity that today's developments present to us. Our only course of action is to seize this opportunity and to build upon it a strong framework for peace and stability to prevail, a peace with progress and justice. Indeed, we believe the United Nations can guide the new changes in the international scene and lead it to the realization of the ideals of the Charter. This is an opportunity for us and for the United Nations. We cannot miss it. Towards these ends, my Government continues to pledge its sustained effort to play its part. These are the thoughts that are the uppermost concern of my Government, and despite my note of caution we look forward to that brighter future.\n61.\tIn conclusion, I wish to thank the Assembly for the patience and understanding with which it has listened to my remarks, lengthy though they may have been. But I do so with the humble hope that they will contribute in some small way towards the search for peace and security, which we all fervently aspire to attain.\n"

        "file_text": "The outstanding election of the representative of Poland as President of this year's session of the General Assembly fills us with joy. We believe that at one and the same it is a tribute paid to his qualifications as a statesman and his wide knowledge of international problems and a tribute paid to Poland, a country that is friendly to the Central African Republic.\n174.\tI should like to associate the delegation of the Central African Republic with the warm congratulations and good wishes that have been addressed to him, to assure him of our full co-operation and to express the deeply felt conviction that under his enlightened guidance our work will lead to results that will live up to his competence and be worthy of the United Nations.\n175.\tI am also pleased to pay a tribute to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. President, Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Indonesia. We greatly appreciate his tact and outstanding competence, thanks to which we were able to work calmly during the course of a particularly difficult session.\n176.\tFinally, it is also a particular pleasure for me to extend again to our eminent Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the personal congratulations of General of the Army Jean-Bedel Bokassa, President for Life of the Central African Republic and of the Government and people of my country, as well as my own personal congratulations, on his appointment to such a high and arduous post at the end of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n177.\tWe are not unaware of the many difficulties that he will confront, but we know, too, that he will give the best of himself in order to overcome them. In assuring him of our unconditional support, we can only wish him great courage and excellent health so that he will be able to work as long as possible on behalf of our Organization.\n178.\tThe year 1972 will have been a year of detente, marked by the process of profound change that has taken place in the structure of international relations, and more particularly among the great Powers. We must mention the Soviet-American agreements on the limitation of strategic offensive and defensive weapons; the allied Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin; the agreements between Poland and the Federal Republic Of Germany and between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic; negotiations on a treaty to normalize relations between the two Germanys; the announcement of a European security conference; the agreement between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America; the visit of Mr. Tanaka, the Prime Minister of Japan, to the People's Republic of China; and the rapprochement between the two Koreas, to name but a few.\n179.\tThese changes were welcomed with joy and satisfaction by the international community as a whole, and particularly by my own country, the Central African Republic, whose domestic and foreign policies have always been based on peace and represent progress that must not be underestimated.\n180.\tBut, unfortunately, we must also note that certain principles of the Charter are far from being complied with.\n181.\tPeace is constantly being disturbed by the persistence or outbreak of numerous conflicts in different parts of the world.\n182.\tThe arms race makes the day of disarmament seem ever more remote. The international division of labor, learnedly advocated by some, nevertheless widens the gap between a super-industrialized world, replete and satisfied, and a world where hunger, sickness, ignorance, need and destitution are the daily portion of hundreds of millions of human beings.\n183.\tEntire peoples are still held in the shackles of colonialism and are despised by the racists, while neocolonialism tries to maintain or consolidate its interests by organizing, assisting or encouraging subversive activities and conspiracies intended to change by violence the regimes of\nStates where the neo-colonialists feel that their interests might be harmed or simply threatened.\n184. Briefly, we must recognize with bitterness that social peace, economic peace and peace itself still must be achieved.\n185. In fact, my delegation is fully aware that the war in South-East Asia, which is unscrupulously maintained by certain great Powers, continues to bring anguish to the tortured souls of the peoples of Viet-Nam and Cambodia, who strongly desire peace and happiness. But it was with satisfaction that we heard from this rostrum a few days ago the statement by Mr. William Rogers, the United States Secretary of State [2038th meeting], in whir! he spoke of a cease-fire throughout IndoChina under international supervision and a total withdrawal of United States troops that would allow the VietNamese people to settle their problems themselves and to decide upon their own future. We are convinced that that was not merely thinking aloud, but that it was a statement of high political import that will without doubt begin to be implemented very soon.\n186.\tThe Middle East crisis is still one of the main concerns of our Organization. We continue to believe that the only road to a peaceful settlement of that painful conflict lies in the strict application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and in the resumption of the Jarring mission.\n187.\tWhat are we to say of the persistence of colonialism and of racial discrimination in Africa, and particularly in southern Africa? In South Africa, in Namibia, in Zimbabwe, in Mozambique and in Guinea (Bissau) the dignity of the black man is still being offended. His fundamental and inalienable rights to self-determination are constantly being trampled underfoot, despite all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n188.\tThe unholy alliance which has arisen in southern Africa between the forces of Portuguese colonialism and the forces of racism of Pretoria and Salisbury and is intended to maintain the supremacy of the white minority constitutes the most heinous crime of this century against mankind.\n189.\tWe strongly condemn and denounce the attitude of certain Powers which not only encourage the racist regimes entrenched in southern Africa and the Portuguese policy in their colonies but continue to deliver weapons to those regimes in order to perpetuate foreign domination in Africa and to allow it to reconquer its positions from its devilish strongholds.\n190.\tIn this connexion we urge the countries directly or indirectly concerned to take into account the Declarations of Lusaka  and Mogadishu  and the more recent Georgetown Declaration of 1972 on these questions. Our firm conviction has been and remains that it is imperative that suitable measures should be taken to allow the United Nations to play a wider and more effective role in the elimination of colonialism and racial discrimination in Africa and in the field of peace-keeping and security in the world.\n191.\tThe full implementation by all Members of the United Nations of the resolutions of this Organization is, we believe, one of the basic elements in the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination. We are pleased to note the praiseworthy efforts already made by the Secretary-General in these fields and we should like to encourage him to continue along these lines.\n192.\tBut how could I end this chapter without mentioning a problem that has been the number one problem in the tendentious international press, a problem insidiously introduced in the General Assembly by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? I am speaking of the Uganda question.\n193.\tIn fact, despite the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the principle of respect for national sovereignty, it is undeniable that certain great Powers continue to organize slander and smear campaigns against other States which are wedded to peace and justice.\n194.\tMay I state on this subject that my delegation is amazed that, after having suffered an unprecedented failure when the people of Zimbabwe rejected the so-called Anglo-Rhodesian arrangements, that same Great Britain has again tried by low and devious maneuvers to focus world attention on a problem that falls exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of a sister republic, namely, the Republic of Uganda.\n195.\tFor our part we believe that it is not within the purview of the United Nations and the General Assembly to find any solution whatsoever to the problem of the expulsion of what the representative of Uganda quite justifiably termed \\\"British citizens of Asian origin\\\" at one of the recent conferences in Africa.\n196.\tWhat are we to say? Are we to set up our Organization as a biased international tribunal? No! The problem presented to our august Assembly is a false one and we must combat it by opposing its consideration, because in the view of my delegation that is a problem that is essentially a domestic problem of Uganda.\n197.\tHow, then, can we explain that Great Britain refuses to welcome on its own soil British subjects expelled by Uganda solely because they are of Asian origin and asks us, the United Nations, to solve in its stead problems which concern it directly?\n198.\tToday the ideas of peace and security, of development and wide-scale multilateral co-operation are supported and appreciated by an ever-growing number of countries. Real conditions exist, such as trade and international economic relations that, we are sure, can become important factors in the maintenance and strengthening of peace and economic and social progress of all peoples.\nImbued with this conviction, we said last year from this same rostrum:\n\\\"For us, in a low income country, the most important objective is and remains the economic and social progress of our people. That is the top priority.\\\" [1958th meeting, para. 223.]\n199.\tWe earnestly hope that the United Nations will be able to bring together the industrialized and the developing countries into a network of economic, trade, technical, social and cultural co-operation. In so doing it would widely contribute to the transformation of the human condition in a very inequitable world.\n200.\tOne of these inequities, as we know, lies in the daily deterioration of the terms of trade which deprives the developing countries of the necessary resources for their arduous struggle for economic progress and helps to widen the gap that separates the needy from the wealthy countries.\n201.\tThe state of international co-operation between the industrialized countries and the third-world nations is far from satisfactory. Today it is undeniable that the third session of UNCTAD held at Santiago did not offer new prospects in trade, nor was any real progress achieved in the desired implementation of generalized preferences. We are still waiting for a spectacular upswing in the curve of transfer of capital, which, unfortunately, has not changed.\n202.\tHow could it be otherwise when many countries were diffident regarding even the holding of that session?\n203.\tAs regards public assistance, today it is reduced to a level that is less than half the commitments established in the International Development Strategy. We might then wonder regarding the future of that so-called Strategy for the \\\"Second Development Decade\\\".\n204.\tHowever, we have not given up hope and we trust that the series of provisions approved by the General Assembly more than a year ago will enable a United Nations development system to handle significant resources more effectively. We are looking forward to the effective implementation of all these measures.\n205.\tFurthermore, we urge the Organization to bring to bear its influence on the specialized loan agencies in order to encourage greater assistance to the needy nations.\n206.\tIn this regard, we feel that these financial organizations should lend a more willing ear to certain vital projects that are so necessary to the developing countries, particularly the least favored ones, such as the land-locked nations, into which category my own country, the Central African Republic, falls when, for different reasons these projects have not acquired financing from bilateral assistance or from private capital sources.\n207.\tThe land-locked developing countries feel that the special measures adopted to favor them will not meet their needs until they are allowed to participate effectively in world trade and its growth and until they are guaranteed access to the sea and possess the necessary transit facilities.\n208.\tIn this connexion it is with great pleasure that I draw the attention of the Assembly to the joint efforts of the African countries to carry out a road project, whose importance is obvious to all, for the linking of Mombasa in the east and Lagos in the west of the African continent. Surely this project deserves the unreserved support of the international community.\n209.\tOn the other hand, it is with great pain that we are reluctantly forced once again to complain from this rostrum of the fact that the railroad project for the linking of the Central African Republic with the Atlantic Ocean, thus releasing my country from its land-locked status a project that was studied for many years and was placed before the World Bank for financing has been languishing endlessly in the offices of that great international organization, although we are a .full-fledged member of it. The reasons for this indifferent attitude towards us escapes our modest understanding; but in the light of the situation how are we to speak of social justice and peace in the world?\n210.\tI cannot remain silent about a problem which is of concern to the Central African Government, that of environment. I am happy to recall that my country was present at the Stockholm Conference and took a very active part in the work done.\n211.\tAlthough the Central African Republic does not suffer equally with the industrialized countries from problems of the environment for which we thank God we are aware of the inter-penetration of the problems of development as a whole with those of the environment and we therefore hops that the United Nations, which bears an important responsibility in this matter, will forthwith adopt suitable measures to ensure the welfare of man and the future of humanity. On the problem of the protection of the environment the United Nations cannot adopt a complacent attitude. The least we could expect would be a policy of vigilance.\n212.\tIt is obvious that the developing countries admit the need for foreign capital, but they do not expect miracles from outside.\n213.\tWe are also aware of the fact that foreign assistance cannot be effective unless it is based on an intensive national effort. As far as the Central African Republic is concerned, under the guidance of its dynamic Head of State, His Excellency General of the Army Jean-Bedel Bokassa, and within the framework of Operation Bokassa, a vast and original strategy for the harmonious development of all the potential of the country, of which I spoke at great length last year from this same rostrum [1958th meeting], the Central African Republic has turned resolutely to continued national participation, thus supporting the economic, social and cultural development of our country.\n214.\tThe results of this strategy, particularly in the agricultural field, have gone well beyond our expectations, and we justifiably think that the specialized agencies of the United Nations, which are already assisting us, will increase their assistance in the years to come in promoting this great national undertaking for the benefit of the hard-working people of Central Africa.\n215.\tIn the present troubled world conditions we can only hope that the Second Development Decade will link the Development Decade with the Disarmament Decade. The two are closely related and they must become one, if not in the letter at least in the spirit, in a Decade of peaceful co-operation for the increased well-being of all peoples.\n216.\tIt surely would not be Utopian to ask the United Nations, on which we found our hopes for a better world, to do all in its power so that this day and age which is already witnessing a universal civilization may mark the beginning of true brotherhood and justice in the world.\n217.\tI would appeal to the peoples of the United Nations on the face of the earth to attack all the ills that threaten peace, so that from the untapped oceans and outer space we may prepare for a harvest of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "A number of important changes have taken place in the world situation since the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. A series of new victories has been achieved by the Asian, African and Latin American peoples in their struggle to win and safeguard national independence. Countries of the third world are getting united on a wider scale to oppose the super-Power policies of aggression, expansion and war; they are playing an ever greater role in international affairs. Meanwhile, some important events have taken place in international relations. In the East, the leaders of China and the United States have held talks after more than 20 years' suspension of relations between the two countries. They have made clear the differences of principle between the two sides and agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should handle their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, non- aggression against other States, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and that international disputes should be settled on this basis, without resorting to the use or threat of force. Recently, Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan paid a visit to China, and the two sides have reached an important agreement on the normalization of the relations between China and Japan, thus realizing the long-standing aspirations of the two peoples and opening up a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. In the West, the Soviet Union and the United States held summit talks and signed a number of bilateral agreements on co-operation in the fields of science and technology, culture, education and health. The European Economic Community has grown and expanded. In the Middle East, far-reaching progress has been made in the Arab nation's struggle to free itself from super-Power control. The struggle of the people of various countries and the changes in international relations have helped in varying degrees to promote the relaxation of international tension.\n141.\tHowever, it cannot but be noted that there is no essential change in the situation in which a super-Power is pushing expansionism by all means in contending for world hegemony. The acute and complicated contradictions and struggles between imperialism on the one hand and the oppressed nations and peoples on the other have not abated.\n142.\tTo this day, the United States war of aggression against Indochina is still going on. Because of the meddling by the Soviet Union, the turmoil on the South Asian subcontinent has failed to subside. The stalemate of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" in the Middle East remains. In Europe, with the two military blocs confronting each other, there is no genuine security and cannot be any. Colonialism of different forms persists in many parts of the world. The sovereignty and independence of many small and medium- sized countries are still being infringed and their national resources plundered. Twenty-seven years have elapsed since the end of the Second World War. There are still foreign military bases of various kinds and large numbers of foreign troops on the territories of many countries. The arms race between the two super-Powers is being stepped up unceasingly, seriously menacing the independence and security of the peoples of the world. The whole Western world is in the grip of financial and monetary crises, which have aggravated its various contradictions. In these circumstances, how can the world not be in turmoil? The world is still in the process of great turbulence, great division and great realignment. The struggle between aggression and anti-aggression, interference and anti-interference, subversion and anti-subversion, control and anti- control is bound to continue for a long time.\n143.\tThe Chinese delegation holds that the people of all countries must not be deluded by certain temporary and superficial phenomena of detente at the present time and develop a false sense of security. While striving for world peace and the progress of mankind, we must maintain sufficient vigilance and make necessary preparations against the danger of new wars of aggression any imperialism may launch.\n144.\tTo end the war in Indochina as soon as possible is the most urgent matter for easing the tension in the Far East. At present, the people of the whole world, including the American people, strongly condemn the United States Government for its wanton bombing, mining and blockading of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and resolutely demand that it immediately stop all its acts of aggression against Viet-Nam and the whole of Indochina and withdraw all the armed forces of the United States and its followers, so that the peoples of the three Indochinese countries may solve their own problems independently, free from any foreign interference. Fair and reasonable ways for the peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam and Indochina question have been put forward in the seven- point proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the elaboration on its two key points and in the Joint Declaration of the Summit Conference of the IndoChinese peoples in April 1970. Of late, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam issued a statement on 11 September demanding that the United States cease its policy of \\\"VietNamizing\\\" the war and supporting the Saigon puppet regime, and pointing out that a solution to the problem of South Viet-Nam must proceed from the actual situation in South Viet-Nam, in which there exist two administrations and two armies as well as other political forces, and stating that a provisional government of national concord composed of three equal segments must be formed to take charge of affairs in the period of transition. This proposal is fair and reasonable. It shows that the VietNamese side has no intention of imposing a Communist regime on South VietNam. Rejection of this proposal precisely bespeaks the attempt to continue to impose the Nguyen Van Thieu puppet regime on the South VietNamese people. The Chinese Government fully sup-ports the just stand of the VietNamese people and of the three IndoChinese peoples.\n145.\tThe three IndoChinese countries are close neighbors of China, and the three Indochinese peoples are the Chinese people's brothers. We are duty bound to support them in their just struggle against foreign aggression, and we will never interfere in their internal affairs. On behalf of the Chinese Government, I once again solemnly declare from this rostrum: so long as the war in IndoChina goes on in whatever form, the Chinese Government and people, not flinching from the greatest national sacrifice, will firmly support the three IndoChinese peoples in fighting to the end.\n146.\tIt is necessary to point out here that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, is the sole legal representative of the Khmer people and effectively controls nearly 90 per cent of Cambodian territory. The Lon Nol regime is imposed on the Khmer people by foreign forces, and it is illegal from the very beginning. The representatives of the Lon Nol clique have no right to occupy Cambodia's seat in the United Nations. More and more countries in the world have recognized this reality and truth. The Chinese delegation holds that the United Nations should rectify the present unreasonable and illegal state of affairs and restore to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia its lawful rights.\n147.\tOn 4 July this year, initiated and promoted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North and South Korea reached agreement on the principles and steps for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, thus strengthening the confidence of the 40 million and more Korean people, who have been divided for 27 years, in the independent and peaceful reunification of their fatherland. The Chinese Government and people warmly welcome this agreement. Nineteen years have elapsed since the armistice in Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea as early as 1958. But in South Korea there still remain a so-called \\\"United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea\\\" and a so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\". This is an anachronism. The combination of the two implies a threat to North Korea. This is an underlying factor making for the continuation of tension on the Korean peninsula. Now, North and South Korea have agreed to achieve gradually the reunification of Korea independently and by peaceful means without reliance upon foreign forces or interference by them. Why should the United Nations keep these two stumbling blocks in front of the Korean people? The General Assembly should discuss the proposed item \\\"Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea\\\" [A/8752 and Add.1-10] and adopt a pertinent resolution to remove these two stumbling blocks. It is regrettable, however, that the discussion of this fair and reasonable proposal has been deferred to next year. To dodge a problem is no solution. It is argued that the discussion should be postponed to next year because North and South Korea are now in contact. This argument is untenable. One may ask, will there be no more contacts between North and South Korea next year? This is obviously a pretext. A postponement is neither in the interests of the Korean people nor conducive to relaxation of tension on the Korean peninsula. We hope that the countries concerned will reconsider their stand.\n148.\tNow I wish to speak on the question of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. We all remember that last December, in this very hall, the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session [2003rd meeting] adopted by the overwhelming majority of 104 votes a resolution calling for cease-fire and troop withdrawal by India and Pakistan [resolution 2793 (XXVI)]. Subsequently, the Security Council also adopted, by 13 votes in favor and 2 abstentions, resolution 307 (1971) which demands a ceasefire, troop withdrawal and release of prisoners of war by all those concerned. However, while the relevant resolutions of the United Nations were not yet implemented, the Soviet Government and its followers raised at the Security Council last August the question of the admission of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" into the United Nations.  In disregard of the reasonable demand of many countries to postpone the consideration of the question, they insisted on a vote to compel China to use the veto. China's stand for postponing the consideration of this question does not mean that we are fundamentally opposed to the admission of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" into the United Nations. China cherishes friendly sentiments for the people of East Bengal and has no prejudice against Mr. Mujibur Rahman. We stand for postponing the consideration of this question, in order to promote a reconciliation among the parties concerned and the implementation of the United Nations resolutions, which are the very immediate concern. However, the Soviet Government has hurriedly pressed for the admission of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" to the United Nations. This is definitely not aimed at helping \\\"Bangladesh\\\", but at forcing China to use the veto, maintaining and aggravating the tensions among the parties concerned on the subcontinent and whitewashing its foul act of supporting the Indian Government in dismembering Pakistan last year. But its attempt will not succeed. If it had been national self-determination, it should have been the people of East Bengal solving their problems by themselves. Why should Indian troops have invaded East Pakistan? And why should the 90,000 and more Pakistani war prisoners and civilians have been taken to India?\n149.\tAfter the admission of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" has been vetoed, certain people are trying to bypass the Security Council and refer the question to the General Assembly for discussion. This is clearly done with ulterior motives. This will in no way help promote a reconciliation among the parties concerned on the subcontinent, nor will it reflect honor on the country inciting such a move. China stands firm on principles. China considers that the question of whether or not reasonable United Nations resolutions supported by the overwhelming majority of its Members are implemented is a matter of principle affecting what direction the United Nations is heading for. And on matters of principle China will never retreat.\n150.\tThe present situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" in the Middle East is solely created by the two super-Powers for their respective interests. Taking advantage of this situation, these two super-Powers are using Arab countries' territories and sovereignty and the Palestinian people's right to existence as so many stakes with which to strike political deals. The United States is openly supporting the aggression by Israeli Zionism. The other super-Power claims to \\\"support and assist\\\" the Arab people in their struggle against aggression. Has it supported and assisted them? It has indeed sold them no small amount of weapons. But strangely, the weapons supplied are not allowed to be used. Is this not asking people to buy scrap iron? Moreover, it demands privileges and bases, and even attempts to subvert their Government. What kind of \\\"friend\\\" is this? It is more dangerous than an open enemy.\n151.\tHowever, recent developments show that the heroic Arab people will not allow others to ride on their backs and lord it over them for long. They have taken determined actions to shake off super-Power domination. This commands admiration. Do not believe the sensational nonsense deliberately spread by a super-Power that no counter-attack should be made against Israel's armed aggression for that would spark a world war. That is meant to scare people. It has been borne out repeatedly by the history of the 20 years and more since the Second World War. We believe that, so long as they strengthen their unity and persevere in their struggle, the Arab countries subjected to aggression are fully capable of recovering their sacred territories and the injured Palestinian people of regaining their national rights.\n152.\tThe Chinese Government has always opposed assassination and the hijacking of individuals as a means of waging political struggles and is also opposed to adventurist acts of terrorism by individuals or by a handful of people divorced from the masses, because they are harmful to the development of the cause of national liberation and people's revolution. But we strongly condemn Israel for the recent barbarous aggression and massacres it has committed against Lebanon, Syria and other Arab countries on the pretext of the \\\"Munich incident\\\". The Chinese people will always stand together with the Arab and Palestinian peoples in their just struggle against aggression.\n153.\tThe situation in the Mediterranean is closely related to that in the Middle East and Europe. In contending for hegemony, the two super-Powers have dispatched large numbers of war vessels to the Mediterranean and set up many military bases there, posing a threat to the security of the countries around the sea. Now more and more Mediterranean countries have raised their voices for \\\"a Mediterranean of the Mediterranean countries\\\", and demanded the withdrawal of foreign fleets from the Mediterranean. Their demand is entirely just and the Chinese Government and people firmly support it.\n154.\tIt is fully understandable that the peoples of the European countries, who have gone through two world wars, are all concerned for the peace and security of Europe. Twenty-seven years have passed since the end of the Second World War, and yet many European countries are still under the military control of one super-Power or the other, with large numbers of foreign troops stationed on their territories. Making use of the confrontation of the two military blocs, each of the two super-Powers is trying hard to keep its allies under control and undermine the opposite side. In these circumstances, how can one speak of genuine peace and security for the people of the European countries? What calls for attention is the fact that there are now some people who, capitalizing on the European people's eager desire for peace, are trying hard by various tactics to cover up the reality that European peace and security are still under threat, and to create the false impression of a European detente and \\\"all quiet on the western front\\\", so as to attain their ulterior purposes. The fact that a super-Power could, when it considered it necessary, launch a surprise attack in order to occupy an ally with massive troops shows that such a \\\"military alliance\\\" is no guarantee of peace at all. Security is out of the question for any country when it is under virtual occupation.\n155.\tWe hold that, in order truly to ensure peace and security for Europe, it is necessary to oppose firmly aggression, interference, subversion and control by the super-Powers, to disband military blocs, to withdraw foreign armed forces and to bring about peaceful coexistence between the European countries on the basis of respect for independence and sovereignty, mutual non- aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit. Otherwise, the so-called; European security conference can only be another name for the division of spheres of influence between the two super-Powers by making use of military blocs. Such a conference would better be called \\\"the European insecurity conference\\\" rather than \\\"the European security conference\\\". An increasing number of countries are demanding that all the European countries should take part as equals in the European security conference and its preparations with equal powers and opposing the holding of the conference as between two blocs. They especially oppose the two big Powers monopolizing everything behind the backs of the other countries and manipulating the destiny of their people. This is an expression of the profound aspirations of the European people. The Chinese Government and people resolutely support the people of the European countries in all their efforts to oppose the power politics and hegemony practiced by the super-Powers.\n156.\tIn Africa, particularly in southern Africa, the mass movements against white colonialist rule, racial discrimination and apartheid and for national liberation have made great new progress, marking a further enhancement of the political consciousness of the African people. The people in southern Africa and other regions which have not yet achieved independence are increasingly aware that the only way to overthrow white colonialist rule and win national liberation is to rely mainly on their own efforts, fully arousing and organizing the masses and waging an unyielding and valiant struggle. It is necessary to seek external assistance, but more and more facts have proved that it is impossible to put an end to colonialist rule by relying on other people. The Chinese Government and people resolutely support the heroic people of Mozambique, Angola, Guinea (Bissau), Azania, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Spanish Sahara. Their struggles are just, and so long as they carry on perseveringly, fear neither hardship nor sacrifice and advance wave upon wave, they will surely, with the sympathy and support of the peoples of Africa and the whole world, win final victory.\n157.\tAs a developing country, China, from its own experience, fully sympathizes with the deep aspirations of the Asian, African and Latin American countries for the defense of their national independence, the protection of their resources and the development of their national economy. We resolutely support the Latin American countries in their struggle to defend their 200-nautical-mile maritime rights. We resolutely support the petroleum and other raw material exporting countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America in their struggle against plunder by foreign forces. We resolutely support the developing countries in their struggle to prevent imperialist countries shifting their economic crisis on to them. We resolutely support the small and medium-sized countries in their struggle against big Powers plundering their fishery resources.\n158.\tWe hold that, in order to change the backward state of their economy, the developing countries should first of all rely on themselves; that is, they should rely mainly on their own efforts and take foreign aid as an auxiliary. The just struggles of the people of all countries support each other. Those countries which have already won liberation are all the more duty-bound to support and assist those countries subjected to oppression and aggression. But now some people are using aid as a means for controlling other countries and expanding their own spheres of influence.\nWhen they give something to other countries, they assume the airs of a benefactor and demand all sorts of privileges. They send to the recipient countries experts and advisers who behave as tyrants, ordering people about and lording it over them. How could this be called aid?\n159.\tWe hold that all countries which are sincere in providing aid to others, including multilateral aid through the United Nations, should help the recipient countries and not exploit them. Their loans should be interest-free or, at least, low in interest. They must not press for repayment but should allow its postponement. When providing a loan or other forms of aid, they should strictly respect the sovereignty of the recipient countries, attach no conditions and ask for no privileges. The purpose of providing aid to other countries should be to help the recipient countries stand on their own feet and to develop an independent national economy. They must not reduce the recipient countries to dependence and subordination in the name of \\\"economic aid\\\" or \\\"the international division of labor\\\", still less place them under their control on the pretext of \\\"aid\\\". China, too, received some foreign aid in the past and had direct experience in this regard. Therefore, today when we provide aid to other countries, we endeavor to act on the above-mentioned principles. Of course, our capabilities in this respect are limited and the aid we can give is not much. But we hold that the above-mentioned principles should be propagated and applied universally.\n160.\tNow I wish to speak on the question of disarmament. Not long ago some agreements on the limitation of strategic armaments were reached by the Soviet Union and the United States in high-level talks. There is no need for us to comment on these agreements if they are regarded merely as bilateral affairs between the Soviet Union and the United States. But if they are being blown up as tremendous achievements on the road of reducing the threat of nuclear war, we cannot agree. These agreements only stipulate some limitation on the quantity of certain categories of nuclear weapons in the possession of the Soviet Union and the United States, but impose no limitation at all on their quality, nor do they mention a single word about the destruction of nuclear weapons. This can by no means be regarded as a step towards nuclear disarmament. On the contrary, this marks the beginning of a new stage in the Soviet-United States nuclear arms race. Before the ink on the agreement had dried, the one hastened to test new-type nuclear weapons and the other expressed its intention to make a big increase immediately in its military expenditure. How can this be described as reducing the threat of a nuclear war? We hold that no fond illusion should be cherished about these agreements. In 1921, the major naval Powers of the time prescribed a limitation on their respective total tonnages of capital ships, and the limitation was reaffirmed in 1930. Everybody knows what happened in the end. It is not without meaning to recall this historical case today.\n161.\tMoreover, the Soviet Union and the United States have stated in the document on the basic principles of relations between them  that they have a special responsibility to avert conflicts which would serve to increase international tensions, and they have recognized each other's security interests based on the principle of equality. What special responsibility and what equal security interests? According to Khruschev's \\\"theory\\\", do they not stand for Soviet-United States collaboration for world domination? Of course, one can talk like that, but it would not be so easy to have it realized.\n162.\tAs everyone knows, war is the continuation of politics. The invention and the development of nuclear weapons have not changed, nor can they change, this truth. Although no new world war has occurred since the Second World War, local wars of various types have never ceased. Why? Because imperialism resorts to armed force in carrying out aggression and expansion. Where there is oppression there is resistance, and where there is aggression there is struggle against aggression. This is inevitable so long as imperialism exists. But now the Soviet Government asserts that in a nuclear age there is no other way than that of peaceful coexistence among States, which presupposes, above all, the renunciation' of the use of force in international relations, that is, the non-use of both conventional and nuclear weapons. It has even spread the alarmist theory that the destructive power of even conventional warfare has by now increased so greatly that the large-scale use of conventional weapons can lead to the annihilation of entire nations. But the world will be safe once there is a resolution on the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. This is a sheer hoax. As a matter of fact, the Soviet Government does not believe in its own theory. Its practice in the Middle East, where it gave weapons to Arab countries but forbade the use of them, does smack a little of this \\\"theory\\\". Yet, in the Indo-Pakistan war last year, it gave undisguised support to the Indian Government in its armed aggression against Pakistan. What kind of non-use of force is this?\n163.\tPeople condemn war and consider it a barbarous way of settling disputes among mankind. But we are soberly aware that war is inevitable so long as society is divided into classes and the exploitation of man by man still exists. There are two categories of wars, just and unjust. We support just wars and oppose unjust wars. If a socialist still wants to be a socialist, he should not oppose all wars indiscriminately. The non-use of force in international relations can only be conditional, and not unconditional. The condition is to realize peaceful coexistence through mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit. And in order to realize this, it is imperative to oppose the policies of aggression and expansion of any imperialism. When imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism of various descriptions are still using force to enslave, commit aggression against, control and threaten a majority of the countries of the world, it is betrayal to the people of the world to advocate non-use of force in international relations indiscriminatingly, without regard to conditions and in an absolute way. If one still has a grain of socialism in him, why does he not produce something presentable for instance, opposition to aggression in international relations, and especially aggression backed by nuclear weapons? Why should he, on the contrary, choose to produce such shabby stuff as renunciation of the use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons? In that way, does he not allow himself to be seen through right away?\n164.\tPermanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons this sounds so nice and looks so much like China's proposition, but in fact it is completely different. We say that, as the first step towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, agreement should first be reached on the non-use of nuclear weapons. And we have publicly declared that at no time and in no circumstances will China be the first to use nuclear weapons. This fully shows that China is developing nuclear weapons for defensive purposes and with the aim of breaking the nuclear monopoly and proceeding from there to eliminate nuclear weapons. If the Soviet Union entertains the same defensive purposes as it has claimed, why does the Soviet representative not dare to come up to this rostrum and make a similar declaration? How can it make people believe its big talk in favor of the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons to be sincere when it, while mouthing the word \\\"prohibition\\\", is constantly brandishing its nuclear weapons, obdurately opposing the possession and development of nuclear weapons by countries with few or no nuclear weapons, feverishly improving and developing its own nuclear weapons and deploying them at the gates of other countries? It asserts that the renunciation of the use of force and prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would be effective only when the two are linked together. In actuality, this is demanding that the people of the world give up their armed struggle against aggression; otherwise, nuclear weapons will be used against them. Is this not its plain logic? Big talk is useless. The proposal of the Soviet Government, no matter how much it is couched in diplomatic language, has the real intent of making all oppressed nations and peoples tamely submit to the nuclear threat of the one or two super-Powers. But they have grossly underestimated the political consciousness of the people of the world.\n165.\tIn order truly to do away with nuclear threats, it is necessary to completely prohibit and thoroughly destroy nuclear weapons. Yet the Soviet. Government dares neither to undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons nor to touch on the question of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, but advocates the cessation of all nuclear tests. Why? As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has made hundreds of nuclear tests. When it had made enough tests in the atmosphere, it proposed the partial ban on nuclear tests. Now when it has made enough underground tests, it calls for a ban on all nuclear tests. Actually this means that the Soviet Union could make any kind of tests when it had the need, and that when it no longer has the need the others are not permitted to make any test. This is another trap blatantly designed to maintain its nuclear monopoly, following the partial nuclear test-ban treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. As a Chinese saying goes, \\\"The magistrates are allowed to burn down houses, while the common people are forbidden even to light lamps.\\\" China absolutely will not fall into this trap. At no time and in no circumstances will China recognize such a right for the Soviet Union or any other nuclear Power. No one but those Powers alone are permitted to develop nuclear weapons; they may threaten others but others are not allowed to exercise the right of self-defense. Can there be such reason on earth? At present, a mere cessation of all nuclear tests without complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons can only hinder countries with few or no nuclear weapons from developing their nuclear capabilities for self-defense but will not affect in the least the nuclear hegemony of the super-Powers. The real purpose of the proposal of the Soviet Government is to maintain its nuclear monopoly and nuclear superiority by capitalizing on many countries' legitimate desire for peace, so that it can have a free hand to carry out its nuclear threat and nuclear blackmail against countries with few or no nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are something which people can neither eat nor wear. China is a developing country and certainly does not want to spend one penny more than necessary on such stuff. China is making nuclear tests under compulsion. Its nuclear tests are taking place in its deep interior, and their number is limited. China is ready at any time to stop all its nuclear tests, but only on the day the nuclear weapons of the nuclear super-Powers and all nuclear countries are completely prohibited and thoroughly destroyed, and not before.\n166.\tOn the question of convening a world disarmament conference, we have explained the position and views of the Chinese Government at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly [1983rd and 2022nd meetings]. We cannot agree to the Soviet position on the \\\"world disarmament conference\\\" as set forth in the Soviet Foreign Minister's letter of 14 August this year [A/8757] to the United Nations Secretary-General. The \\\"world disarmament conference\\\" as proposed by the Soviet Union has neither the necessary requisites nor a clear aim. It would in fact be an \\\"empty-talk club\\\" which would indulge in far-ranging rambling discourse without solving any practical problem. To hold such a conference would only serve to hoodwink and lull the people of the world. It is better not to hold it.\n167.\tThe actual situation in the world today is this. The two super-Powers are maintaining military bases of various kinds, including nuclear bases, and stationing large numbers of their armed forces, including nuclear-missile forces, in many countries; their airplanes, warships and submarines, including those carrying nuclear weapons, are flying and plying everywhere; and they have up to now refused to undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, particularly not to use them against non-nuclear countries. To varying degrees, all the countries in the world with no nuclear weapons and those with few nuclear weapons are exposed to their threat. The most urgent question today is the withdrawal of foreign armed forces, rather than the reduction of armaments. Let the two super-Powers withdraw all their armed forces, both conventional and nuclear, back to their own countries. If they do not even want to effect a withdrawal, how can one believe that they are willing to make an arms reduction?\n168.\tThe cry for general and complete disarmament has been going on for more than a dozen years. But the result is general and complete arms expansion by the two superPowers, while all the small and medium-sized countries of the world are in a position of defense inadequacy. This hoax should not be allowed to continue. In order that a world disarmament conference will make a true start and carry on fruitfully instead of becoming a bout of deceptive empty talk, it is imperative to create the necessary conditions for the convening of such a conference, namely, all nuclear countries, particularly the Soviet Union and the United States which possess the greatest amount of nuclear weapons, must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons, and that they not only will not use nuclear weapons against each other, but, more importantly, will not use them against the non-nuclear countries, and they must withdraw from abroad all their armed forces, including nuclear missile forces, and dismantle all their military bases, including nuclear bases, on the territories of other countries. Only thus will it be possible to create the necessary conditions for all the countries, irrespective of their size; to discuss and solve on an equal footing the important questions of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and the reduction of conventional weapons.\n169.\tSince the beginning of this year, the United Nations and its Security Council have done much work thanks to the joint efforts made by the overwhelming majority of the Member States. What merits special mention is that the Security Council held special meetings in Africa on African questions. This was an unprecedented action taken at the demand of many African countries. The meetings adopted a number of useful resolutions on some African questions. At the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in the capital of Chile, many developing countries forcefully exposed the situation in which certain developed countries, by trade, tariff, monetary and other means, are monopolizing international markets, shifting their economic crisis onto, and stepping up the plunder and exploitation of, other countries, thus aggravating the irrational international phenomenon of \\\"the rich becoming richer and the poor poorer\\\". The developing countries strongly demanded that this state of affairs must be changed. At the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in the capital of Sweden, many countries of the third world strongly condemned imperialism for carrying out policies of aggression and war and put forward a number of sound views and reasonable opinions on the question of conserving and improving the human environment. At the sessions of the sea-bed Committee, many countries of the third world carried out resolute struggles to safeguard their own natural resources and upheld the just position that each country has the right to determine the scope of its own territorial sea and jurisdiction. At all these meetings and conferences, many countries of the third world showed their firm determination to oppose imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism and played important roles.\n170.\tHowever, we cannot but point out with regret that owing to obstructions by the one or two super-Powers the United Nations has remained weak and ineffective in dealing with many major international issues. Some correct resolutions adopted by the United Nations remain unimplemented due to hindrance by one or two big Powers. Many organs and agencies of the United Nations are still dominated by a small number of countries and fail to reflect the demands and opinions of the great number of countries of the third world. In the United Nations there still prevails the very serious phenomenon of discussions without a decision and decisions without implementation. All this should be corrected speedily.\n171.\tHere I wish to deal with the Chinese Government's views on the review of the United Nations Charter. As is known to all, the United Nations Charter was drawn up near the end of the Second World War and it was a product of the historical conditions prevailing at the time. However, history is making advances and things are developing. In some respects the Charter formulated 27 years ago obviously cannot meet the tremendous change that has occurred in the international situation and in the United Nations. There were 51 original Members at the founding of the United Nations. Since then more than 80 countries have joined the United Nations, most of which are newly independent countries. It is understandable that there is a demand for the United Nations Charter to reflect fully the present state of affairs in the world. We maintain that on the basis of upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter careful consideration should be given to the views of various countries for necessary revisions of the Charter so as truly to give effect to the principle that all Member States, big or small, are equal. Of course, we likewise consider that the revision of the Charter is a serious and important question, and we are ready to join you all in serious explorations.\n172.\tThe world is at the cross-roads, and so is the United Nations. If the United Nations is to regain its prestige and play its due role, it must conform to the trend of the world, truly express the just demands of large numbers of its Members and the people of the world, act strictly in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and free itself from manipulation and control by the big Powers. It must be trustworthy in word and resolute in deed. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for the United Nations to avoid eventually taking the old path of the League of Nations. The Chinese delegation is ready to work together with the delegations of all countries which love peace and uphold justice to make the United Nations truly capable of playing a role in safeguarding international peace and promoting the cause of the progress of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am very happy to add my congratulations to those you have already received from so many on your unanimous election as President of this session of the Assembly. It is a just recognition of your personal merits and a well-deserved tribute to your country, Poland, for whose prosperity I express my best wishes.\n133.\tThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of our Organization during the past year [A/8701 andAdd.l] has been given the careful consideration which such a well-prepared document deserves. We are grateful to Mr. Waldheim for the information and the guidance his report has given us. It shall be our guide as we strive to be productive in the service of mankind, and it has aroused in my delegation greater confidence in what we can accomplish here.\n134.\tWe continue to believe that the United Nations is our best option to resolve the political conflicts which at present keep many nations apart or only serve to foster tension among them. We also continue to believe that it is here in this Organization that States have their best opportunity jointly to forge just, viable and effective solutions to reconcile their economic interests which have thus far seemed to be incompatible. We believe that in the United Nations peoples have their best opportunity to leave behind past errors and to build a future in which various cultures, diverse ideologies and different economic systems will compete nobly, in broad areas of agreement, so as to obtain for their citizens freedom, prosperity and the advancement of the human spirit.\n135.\tThe United Nations, born of the tragedy of global warfare and of the dismaying poverty and ignorance in which most of our fellow human beings live, cannot and must not fail.\n136.\tHuman institutions must periodically revise their structures and activities. New and unforeseeable needs require more suitable procedures, more flexible methods and more functional structures. The United Nations is no exception to this sociological rule. We do not cling to standards of action or structures which, in the face of new requirements, reduce the likelihood of attaining the purposes of those who forged the Charter at San Francisco. Experience is our teacher, and we must benefit from its lessons.\n137.\tCosta Rica has welcomed, and plans to study, the proposals made by the illustrious Government of Colombia regarding certain amendments to the United Nations Charter [see A/8746]. We shall participate in the discussion of this item [item 89] in the certainty that the statements of other delegations will shed new light on how best still further to improve upon the proposals of Colombia, and we shall vote in favor of them when the time comes to adopt a decision.\n138.\tHowever, we believe that together with reforms to improve the performance of our Organization it is necessary for all of us to acquire the conviction that the United Nations will be what the Member States wish it to be. The whole will be no better than the sum of its parts. The degree of sincerity with which each State Member of this Organization adheres to and achieves its objectives, the degree of sincerity with which each State supports its purposes and action, will be a measure of the degree to which the United Nations will respond to the hopes of the peoples of the world.\n139.\tWe welcome the relaxation of tension which has taken place between the great Powers, which has been made manifest in the statements of the Secretary of State of the United States of America [2038th meeting] and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics [2040th meeting] in this general debate. This move by certain great nations, which had maintained until quite recently dangerously hostile relations, to seek no longer armed confrontation but dialog, no longer diatribe but understanding and negotiation, nourishes the hope that peaceful coexistence and, even more, constructive relations among nations of various political creeds, can some day become a magnificent reality.\n140.\tIn our Organization we must give these budding signs, like weak plants, all our solicitous, patient and generous support, being aware that there is no human problem that man cannot solve if it is approached with a desire for justice and truth.\n141.\tOf course, it is necessary that this collective action be supported by the individual conduct of each nation consistent with the expressions of peace and international co-operation which may be heard here.\n142.\tThe era of confrontation, born of the hatred and suspicion of the cold war, must for all time yield to an era of negotiation.\n143.\tThe extremist thesis that the democratic and Communist nations cannot coexist in the same world and that sooner or later one form of society will completely dominate the other must be rejected in theory and in practice as the product of sick fanaticism.\n144.\tRegrettably, the residue of this fanaticism still permeates the propaganda which poisons the minds of peoples who live under both political systems. While the statesmen of the great Powers meet and strive to build a world in which they can live together in peace, their propaganda and security agencies continue to function according to the obsolete dogmas of the cold war. They seem to be determined to carry on the absurd task of maintaining the small nations as belligerents in a cold war which the leaders of the great Powers have already decided to replace by peaceful coexistence.\n145.\tCosta Rica believes that the desire for peace, which has inspired the steps taken by the statesmen of the most powerful nations in the world in the last few years and has led to an atmosphere of coexistence, which we here applaud, must be supported and practiced by all nations, large and small. It is precisely for this reason that the Government of which I am a part decided to break the isolation in which it has lived with regard to the socialist nations and has established beneficial diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia.\n146.\tThis position has exposed us to enraged propaganda attacks on the part of those who wish to maintain the climate of the cold war, and those attacks have been welcomed by the fanatics in our own country and have created suspicion among some Governments in our area which are still living under that influence. Nevertheless, our Government is prepared to continue to deal with those who prefer to sacrifice mankind to a nuclear holocaust rather than tolerate the existence of political doctrines contrary to their own.\n147.\tThe acceptance of the existence of various ideologies in the political field and the conviction that it is undesirable, and indeed impossible, for a man or a nation to determine what is best for all of mankind constitute the very basis of the democratic system, in which we hope to continue to live in Costa Rica. We are therefore prepared to maintain and broaden our relations with nations which have adopted systems different from ours, as long as they respect our sovereignty. We feel sure that this position, which has unleashed a storm against our Government, deserves the support and understanding of the vast majority of the States Members of this Organization.\n148.\tThe United Nations is committed, because of its origin, to carry forward to the end in the fight against fear. That is why the item on disarmament must be a key question at every session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-General has sadly warned us that there has been no halt or perceptible slowing down in the arms race [A/8701/Add. 1, p. 3]. The information that he has furnished us is alarming. It states that in the decade of the 1960s the countries of the world allocated $1,870,000 million to acquire weapons of war and that in the last years the total military expenditures for that purpose have increased by approximately $200,000 million a year. Costa Rica, which has set an example and shown that it is possible for a nation to live without an army, sadly takes note of these facts. We regret even more that nations with grave problems of under-development have become swept up in this dizzying arms race.\n149.\tHowever, there are signs of hope, at least in the legal field, in the commitments that nations have entered into. The Antarctic Treaty; the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, Outer Space and under Water; the Tlatelolco Treaty; the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the treaties which forbid the emplacement of nuclear weapons in outer space, the sea-bed and the ocean floor; and the recent convention on the prohibition of the use of biological weapons; as well as the agreement reached at the summit meeting held in Moscow in May of this year by the leaders of the two great Powers of the world on the limitation of strategic weapons-all of this has raised the hopes of peoples that the night of terror will be left behind, and we now dimly see at least the dawn of a day without terror.\n150.\tThe General Assembly must continue to go forward. The hopes of peoples during this session would be increased if States which have not yet done so would announce that they have signed any of those treaties, in which they have been invited to participate. We shall welcome any action intended to establish some organ charged with preparing, prudently but with firm resolution, the convening of a world disarmament conference which would be charged with attaining one of the noblest goals which the peoples set for themselves when they constituted the United Nations, namely, to end the scourge of war.\n151.\tIn the past years there has been an epidemic of criminal attacks and threats against personal security. We have had to endure a wave of savage terrorism which, in the words of Secretary of State Rodgers, \\\"tragically touched the lives of people everywhere, without warning, without discrimination, without regard for the sanctity of human Me\\\" [2038th meeting, para. 76].\n152.\tIn a praiseworthy move to draw the attention of the United Nations to the principal problems of mankind, the Secretary-General made a solemn appeal to this Assembly to seek the appropriate means to fight terrorism and other forms of violence which jeopardize and destroy innocent human lives.\n153.\tThe Foreign Minister of Brazil, Ambassador Mario Gibson Barboza, deplored in this Assembly the fact that no support had been given to the wording of the item as requested by Secretary-General Waldheim in the clear and decisive manner in which it was recommended by the General Committee [ibid., para. 6]. Like my colleague, I regret that amendments were introduced to that wording which seem to imply that in certain cases terrorism could be considered a legitimate political instrument. We totally reject these attempts to justify what cannot be justified. We can never accept the view that in order to reach certain political or social aims it is permissible to endanger the lives of innocent human beings who are totally alien to the conflict, or to disrupt international communications, thereby reducing the opportunities for people to come together.\n154.\tOn other occasions in this and other forums Costa Rica has proposed the adoption of severe measures to put an end to terrorism. We have asked that such measures be applied not only to the persons who carry out terrorism and to the organizations responsible, but also to the Governments which protect them. If no nations were accomplices, terrorism would not last long. The suspension of air service to and from the countries which give refuge to the pirates and terrorists in general would doubtless constitute one of the most effective means in the fight against such crimes against mankind.\n155.\tMy delegation will support any draft resolution or convention intended to combat in the most effective way possible this criminal activity. We consider that we cannot leave this session of the Assembly without having formulated adequate instruments to contain international terrorism. We therefore would venture to appeal to the delegations that were determined to postpone the discussion of so fundamental an item in the Sixth Committee to set aside their obstructionist attitude and, '-without any political preferences or ideological partisanship, to realize that it is urgent and indispensable to unite firmly and decisively to confront this indiscriminate and odious violence, which violates one of the basic human rights proclaimed by our Organization.\n156.\tThe Middle East continues to be the burning issue in which world peace is at stake. There is at issue both peace and security as well as the possibilities for the economic and social development of the people of the area who deserve our fullest sympathy.\n157.\tIt is with dismay that we have seen how in the past this Organization has adopted certain resolutions which, instead of promoting peace, have contributed to the creation of obstacles to a direct understanding between the parties to the dispute. The debates have been neither calm nor objective. The voting has been in blocs, in most cases without taking into account the merits of the proposals under study.\n158.\tCosta Rica is intensely concerned to contribute, with other nations, to bring about the day when peace will reign in the Middle East. We have proposed and will continue to ; propose and support dispassionate draft resolutions which seek a meeting of the minds between the parties. We shall insist on the need to prepare the way for direct negotiations between the belligerents and on the just demand that all the States of the area recognize the lawful and sovereign existence of the State of Israel within secure borders clearly defined in treaties with its neighbors.\n159.\tThis Organization cannot afford to continue to neglect, as though it did not exist, the conflict in Indochina. I here endorse the prudent words of the Secretary-General when he told us that he was deeply concerned that \\\"the United Nations, which was created as a result of a world war in order to safeguard international peace and security in the future, appears to have no relevance to what is now happening in Viet-Nam\\\" [see A/'8701/Add. 1, p. 4].\n160.\tUndoubtedly it is the duty of the United Nations at last to concern itself with the enormous humanitarian problems which arise in that area of conflict. We must be vigilant to prevent the worsening of the situation from affecting the peace and security of all mankind.\n161.\tWe consider that the peace offer made by President Nixon is reasonable: if the North VietNamese were to release the United States prisoners and accept a genuine cease-fire, the United States would withdraw completely from VietNam and would even end its military assistance to the South VietNamese. In these conditions, the future of Viet-Nam could be discussed in peace conferences and not on the battlefield.\n162.\tIf all foreign support for North and South Viet-Nam were to end, the cease-fire to be negotiated could put an end to a bloody war which for more than 20 years has been eroding the vitality of that country. Without foreign support the North and South VietNamese will find a solution to their differences, even though this may not be wholly satisfactory to a sizable part of the population. The political regime that would arise from the settlement could be no worse than the brutal bloodletting and destruction that the VietNamese have suffered for decades, in large measure because of foreign intervention.\n163.\tCosta Rica continues to be firmly in the trenches in the struggle against all forms of racial discrimination. With the same vigor as that with which we have condemned and continue to condemn apartheid and other odious forms of discrimination which men of the white race practice against those of the black race, we also condemn the new manifestations of racism which have led majority groups of the black race to commit odious discriminatory acts against human beings of another race.\n164.\tWorld public opinion is shaken by the deportation en masse of persons of Asian origin who have had their homes in Uganda. That is particularly serious when one realizes that, apart from being driven from their homes because they belong to a race different from that of the majority of the population of Uganda, thousands of human beings will be deprived of all their belongings. A mandatory deadline has been set for leaving the country, under the threat that if they do not leave their homes they will be sent to concentration camps.\n165.\tMy deleDation adds its voice to the voices of protest of other delegations and unfortunately, all too few-against this brutal trampling of the rights of the Ugandans of Asian origin. We support the British proposal that the item should be included in the agenda of this Assembly [A/8794]. We agree with the point of view stated by Sir Alec Douglas- Home, to the effect that this item should be debated without delay in the General Assembly, since the inhuman action which creates refugees is of undoubted international concern [2042nd meeting, para. 118].\n166.\tCosta Rica, although it is a developing country with unemployment problems, is prepared, as a token of the good faith with which it acts in such matters, to receive on its soil a group of inhabitants of Uganda who are victims of the discriminatory acts of their Government. President Figueres has responded to the humanitarian appeal made by the Secretary-General with a warm message of support and with a decision to contribute to the asylum provided to those who have been expelled.\n167.\tThe Russian Jews constitute a small part of the Soviet population. Nevertheless, they have contributed to the great achievements of that great Power. They maintain spiritual links with a nation which, spread throughout the world, has decided to establish a proper home on the soil where its forefathers forged its culture and history.\n168.\tInternational public opinion has come out against the restrictions imposed on the Jews by the Soviet Union with regard to free emigration to their homeland. Criticism comes not only from the enemies of the political-social regime of the Soviet Union; it comes also from many great admirers of socialism and leaders of Communist parties in various parts of the world.\n169.\tMy delegation sincerely believes that the Soviet Union would win greater respect in world public opinion if, instead of bargaining for the talents of these people, they were to yield those talents, which have forged their own culture, to a nation which is trying to build a prosperous, just and free society for its sons who have wandered throughout the world. It is, furthermore, a nation that has given constant proof of its decision to share its own achievements with the under-developed peoples of the world.\n170.\tThe State of Bangladesh came into being as a result of the resistance of a people heroically united against the most pitiless form of political repression. The Bengali nation stoically bore genocide rather than abdicate its endeavors to exercise self-determination. Now that the people have achieved self-determination, after a bloody battle, we cannot close the doors of the international community to them.\n171.\tIt is an irony that the People's Republic of China, to which entry to the United Nations was prohibited for so many years, has cast its first veto in the Security Council to prevent the State of Bangladesh from occupying its lawful seat in our Organization.\n172.\tCosta Rica, which was the first Latin American country to extend diplomatic recognition to the new Bengali State, will enthusiastically support the recommendation it hopes the General Assembly will make for the purpose of opening the doors of the United Nations to the representatives of Bangladesh.\n173.\tThe Secretary-General, as an encouraging fact mentioned in his report on the work of the Organization, emphasizes the efforts of co-operation within the Organization in the fields of trade and development, the human environment and population. Indeed, even the severest critics of the United Nations are generous in their praise of this field of action of the United Nations,\n174.\tThis is the hour of international justice and equity. The poorer nations of the world harbor resentments born of an injustice-laden past. They wish to possess and reap the fruits of their national resources and to have their national labor well paid for, since they have to pay very well for the labor of the wealthy nations. The poor nations wish to achieve an integral economic and social growth. They cannot agree that growth should continue to favor only some small sectors of mankind or certain nations while the vast majority continues to be immersed in poverty, ill- health, malnutrition, lack of opportunity for education and under-employment of natural and human resources.\n175.\tLet us bear in mind, as the Secretary-General warns us in his report, that to make progress in the solution of the global problems of the economic and social development of peoples \\\"... Governments must develop more of a concern for each other's interests, a clear sense of each other's preoccupations and a wider knowledge of the sensibilities of other Governments and cuVLmQs\\\" [A/9701/Add. 1, p. 5]. My delegation wishes to place on record its confidence that the highly developed nations will for their own benefit heed the demands of the developing countries. We trust that in reducing their arms expenditures they will channel such resources to the peoples that live submerged in underdevelopment and thereby co-operate with them in the attainment of a better life.\n176.\tThe United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea held in Geneva in 1958 and 1960 constituted the point of departure, and not the target, of legal developments which must bear fruit in the forthcoming United Nations conference on the law of the sea. The most important contribution to this development was given by Latin America, with its thesis of a greater extension of the territorial sea or of broader special jurisdiction for the coastal State to protect and exploit the ichthyological and natural resources of the adjacent sea and its coast.\n177.\tThe thesis that sea-hunting and fishing beyond the territorial waters of only a few miles of breadth must be governed absolutely by the principle of the freedom of the seas might have been warranted in the periods of history in which maritime resources seemed to be inexhaustible. But the use of increasingly sophisticated techniques of sea- hunting and fishing, and the building of increasingly bigger fleets, with a greater capacity to extend their activities to areas far removed from their countries of origin, brought about an irrational and wrongful exploitation of the riches of the sea.\n178.\tThat is why the principle of the freedom of the seas, which must continue to be considered untouchable for maritime and air transit, must be limited so far as the exploitation of resources is concerned.\n179.\tIn order to conserve and exploit for the benefit of the peoples of the coastal States the riches of the adjacent seas, in South America the thesis emerged that 200 miles should be the breadth of the territorial sea. At the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea, held at Santo Domingo on 7 June 1972, the more advanced concept was adopted of a patrimonial sea with a breadth of up to 200 miles.\n180.\tIn the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721, annex I, sect. 2] it was recognized that the breadth of the territorial sea should be the subject of an international agreement. It was also agreed that until such time, \\\"every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit of 12 nautical miles measured from the applicable base line.\\\"\n181.\tAt that Conference it was made perfectly clear that one must not confuse the territorial sea, where the coastal State exercises all the attributes of full sovereignty, with another additional and broader area, which has been called the patrimonial sea, where the coastal State exercises a sovereignty limited to the exploitation, exploration and conservation of marine resources, without jurisdiction to interfere with free navigation or with the right to lay under-water cables and pipes which any other State enjoys.\n182.\tThe 12-mile breadth is more than sufficient for the territorial sea and its purposes, which are conservation and the security of the coastal State. The complication has arisen because of the use of the concept of territorial sea for the economic defense of fisheries or the exploration and exploitation of marine resources existing in an adjacent area of the territorial sea, which can be extended up to 200 miles. Because the truth is that the jurisdiction which some South American States exercise over an area up to 200 miles, which they call the territorial sea, does not have the characteristics of full sovereignty, but is limited to the exploration, exploitation and conservation of the renewable and non-renewable resources of what was formerly the high seas. The confusion therefore arises out of giving the same name to two different things: the zone of the territorial sea, strictly speaking and there is no reason for it to exceed 12 miles and the adjacent area which can be extended up to 200 miles, where jurisdiction limited to the economic field is the only one exercised.\n183.\tIn the patrimonial sea, aircraft and ships of all States, whether coastal or not, have the right to free navigation and overflight, with no other restrictions than those that result from the exercise by the coastal State of its rights in the same area.\n184.\tInasmuch as recognizing a breadth of up to 12 miles for the territorial sea would include some straits, one must therefore enter a qualification to the effect that the extension of the territorial sea, and still less that of the patrimonial sea, shall in no way curtail the freedom of maritime navigation and air navigation over those straits.\n185.\tCosta Rica reiterates at this time its support for the principle stated by the General Assembly in its resolution 2749 (XXV) that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the territorial sea and continental shelf are the common heritage of mankind.\n186.\tThe peoples of the world expect just solutions for the many international problems which beset them. For them let us try to maintain this Organization as the most appropriate instrument to preserve peace, to bring about general well-being, and to defend freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of Portugal to the United Nations has always had the delegation of Poland as its neighbor on the left. The two delegations have always maintained mutual relations of peaceful coexistence and even of good neighborliness. In Europe, our countries are not neighbors. But the ancient history of both countries never separated Portugal and Poland in the veneration of our spiritual values, in the keen patriotism of our inhabitants and in their contribution to civilization. In like fashion nothing today separates the two nations in the aspiration, common to both, for a lasting peace and co-operation among all the peoples of our continent.\n2.\tMy delegation and I rejoice at seeing you elevated to the highest office of this General Assembly, and we most sincerely wish you, Sir, the greatest of personal success.\n3.\tThe task of the President of the General Assembly is not an easy one. The problems that arise are many and complex. They must be solved harmoniously, in strict observance of the Charter and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Thus, the President is called upon to display understanding tempered by prudence, flexibility matching firmness, and a spirit of conciliation that will not strain justice. Ample proof of these qualities was given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Mr. Adam Malik, the President of the last session of the General Assembly. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey to Mr. Malik, on behalf of my delegation and personally, our warmest greetings. I would also express the hope that this session of the Assembly, under your guidance, Sir, will contribute to greater harmony among States and peoples, a harmony which can flow only from a spirit of justice, respect for truth, understanding and tolerance.\n4.\tAt this moment when the General Assembly is starting its work there is much to concern us. In the international political arena there is a clash of ideologies, ambitions, interests and anxieties. Up to a point this is normal, for life itself signifies movement and dynamism. But crises and conflicts multiply in the world, bringing disorder, insecurity and death. We regret these facts, but it seems that not all are agreed that there can be no peace or security without order, and that there can be no order without international norms which all must obey. No one, I believe, would attribute the existing world crises and conflicts to a lack of normative regulations of harmonious intercourse among nations, just as no one would attribute the state of affairs in this Organization to any deficiency in the principles enshrined in the Charter.\n5.\tThe United Nations was established with one specific and fundamental objective in view: to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security by preventing and repelling aggression through collective action. The provisions enunciating the purposes and fundamental principles on which this Organization rests reflect the keenest aspirations of mankind and the juridical norms without which those ideals cannot be achieved: the maintenance of international peace and security; the peaceful settlement of all conflicts; the sovereign equality of all Member States; the renunciation of the threat or use of force; noninterference in the internal affairs of States; non-recourse to war, aggression and violence. The most authoritative voices in the world have proclaimed this.\n6.\tToday, 27 years after the last world conflagration, mankind is able to look with a measure of relief on important initiatives seeking to lessen the causes of tension among the great Powers. But everything that has been achieved in this vital field, where the very survival of the human species is at stake, has taken place outside the United Nations, without the latter having in any fashion influenced the march of events.\n7.\tWe enthusiastically applaud the partial successes already achieved in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the Soviet-American and Chinese-American contacts, the German-Soviet treaty,  the German-Polish treaty  and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin,  as well as the progress achieved in the preparations for a conference on security \nand co-operation in Europe. But we would wish to see the spirit of conciliation and dialog that made that important progress possible prevail in this Organization also and make it possible to solve the crises and conflicts that still exist in the world today.\n8.\tThe realities of the balance of power politics have thrust the specter of a world war farther into the distance. But they have not prevented the continued eruption of localized conflicts or the more generalized use of violence in the most varied and novel forms.\n9.\tRecent spectacular events have brought the matter of the use of violence to the general debate of this Assembly. Everything that has been said about violence focuses attention on three themes, which are at the center of all debates and controversies: violence and its legitimate causes; the primacy of the rule of law; and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.\n10.\tThe condemnation by the Charter of the United Nations of war and aggression is an absolute and all- embracing principle. It implies the primacy of peace over war, of negotiation over conflict, of dialog over confrontation. The definition on which, in a specific case, the qualification of a given party who has violated the principle and the rule of law etc. depends may be discussed indefinitely, but no one possessed of any common sense and of sound mind would be able to discuss in the abstract the primacy of peace over war. Except in cases of self-defense, individual or collective, all wars are unlawful; all wars are to be condemned; all wars are unjust. The new international order established at San Francisco sought to do away once and for all with practices and ideas which were supposed to have been definitely rendered obsolete.\n11.\tWar as a means or an instrument for the achievement of national and international objectives-whether these be territorial aggrandizement, economic expansion, the acquisition of living space, greater security for a State or group of States, the elimination of injustices in third States, the liberation of supposedly oppressed minorities or majorities, the supremacy of a race or religion, the advancement of an ideology or social system considered superior was condemned once and for all.\n12.\tBut that did not eliminate the causes, conditions, elements, objectives, doctrines and ideologies which in the past had provoked aggressions and armed conflicts, and which, moreover, had always been invoked by aggressors and warmongers to justify their actions. In the present-day world there persist almost everywhere, perhaps with even greater intensity, different ideologies, opposing systems, conflicts of interest, territorial claims, unjust situations, gross inequities in the level of development, discrimination and oppression, persecutions, violations of the rights of individuals and of groups. Which State in this Organization has not already been the object of an accusation, or been in opposition or in conflict with another State or group of States in any one of those areas? Which will be exempt from them in the future?\n13.\tBut no divergence of systems, no opposition of ideologies, no conflict of interest, no wish for justice or reform, no desire whether sincere or fictitious-for liberation can legitimize the use of force by one State or group of States against another State or group of States. Today, the world conscience does not accept this; nor does the Charter of our Organization permit it.\n14.\tNevertheless, the final and unconditional condemnation of war and aggression does not signify general passivity or the maintenance of the status quo in all areas. It may be said, however, that this condemnation marks a turning- point in history, which has given mankind a new confidence in itself and renewed faith in the possibility of achieving justice and progress through peaceful means. Contemporary man draws from the most profound meaning of the great currents of history lessons of a new philosophy of peace and non-violence which must inspire and impregnate the international order of today.\n15.\tThe great conquests of man were not the fruit of a victory at arms. Greek philosophy came to dominate the Roman conqueror. The law born in Rome came to be accepted by the invading barbarians. The Napoleonic Code and the principles of 1789 survived even after Waterloo. If such was the case in the past, today, in this second half of the twentieth century with the advance of science and technology ensuring as never before the circulation of ideas, communication between men and the opening up of all societies to mutual influences-can we entertain any doubts about the triumphant power of thought, the overwhelming contagion of freedom, the virtues of economic development and the expansion of culture in modifying the behavior of men and correcting social injustice?\n16.\tBut unorganized violence has succeeded the violence exercised by States, even though it is often fostered and directed by them. Under the guise of wars of liberation, of struggle against oppression, of fighting against imperialism and against capitalism, once again attempts are made to give a semblance of legitimacy to violence and aggression. It is significant that in a debate on the question of terrorism the voices raised in an attempt to legitimize the use of violence as an instrument of the alleged justice of the causes invoked resurrected obsolete doctrines of a \\\"just war\\\".\n17.\tIn an intervention of the purest medieval flavor, the representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics spoke of terrorists who subsequently become heroes. He thereby wished to conclude that the international order must accept and support terrorism in certain cases that is to say, only in those cases which serve the interests and designs of the Soviet Union. Has the representative of the Soviet Union also thought of the heroes of Prague and Budapest, and the statues which one day will commemorate in those capitals a just and legitimate struggle against a foreign oppressor? Will not the same reasoning lead him to find in the historical evocation of the heroic warriors of Holy Russia arguments to impart legitimacy to the use of force in the service of the objectives of modern Soviet imperialism?\n18.\tThe condemnation, prevention and repression of violence and terrorism must be general and unconditional if they are to become rules of law. They cannot become enmeshed in the doctrinal and ideological disputes that divide States. If the international community really intends to free humanity from the scourge of terrorism and violence, it cannot accept these loose distinctions between just and unjust terrorism, legal and illegal terrorism, between terrorism that has been recognized by the Organization of African Unity and terrorism that has received no recognition.\n19.\tWhich shall be the good terrorists and which the bad? Those whom a precarious and temporary majority in this General Assembly regard as such at a given moment? And if at the following session, or a few years later, the alignment of combinations of interest and votes in this Assembly were to change, would not then the bad terrorists be hailed as heroes and the good ones regarded as criminals? What guarantees can the adoption of such a doctrine offer the international community? What judge in any country of Europe, Asia, the Middle East or America could condemn a terrorist with a clear conscience if the qualification of an act of terrorism is to depend on the opinion of the majority of this Assembly at a given moment?\n20.\tThe weeding out of violence and terrorism must be based on the supremacy of the rule of law. But this law, in order to be valid, must be general. The principle of the universality of law is a fundamental achievement of civilization, and a basic legacy of the culture of the peoples of the world. It is a principle that is essential to social life, both national and international. But it is a cold principle. It is not compatible with emotional appeals to crusades and holy wars, with confraternities of continent-wide or race- wide armed blocs, or with resolutions approved in Rabat, Addis Ababa or Dar-es-Salaam.\n21.\tDiscrimination in the application of law, domestic or international, is an odious and revolting practice. It destroys all the moral and juridical foundation of the law, deprives it of all validity, and incites its violation, giving legitimacy to such violation.\n22.\tPortugal has been one of the victims of such discrimination. Principles deemed valid in certain cases are denied in Portugal's case. Rules applied to other countries are cast aside with contempt where Portugal is concerned. But the violation of this principle is infinitely dangerous for all. No one knows who will be tomorrow's victim. Man's memory is short, but that of history is inflexible and inexorable.\n23.\tWhen, 11 years ago, a merchant ship was the victim of an act of piracy in the mid-Atlantic, an act that took the lives of peaceful members of its crew, there was no reaction on the part of the international community, and many viewed that crime with sympathy, simply because the victims were Portuguese.\n24.\tThus was the door opened to aerial piracy. Those who today are inclined to consider anti-Portuguese terrorism as legitimate may perhaps tomorrow have to employ from this rostrum the same dramatic eloquence with which, at the current session, acts of aerial piracy were denounced in order to defend rules designed to protect the lives of nationals of their own countries attacked by the liberation movements which the majority of United Nations Members then considered legitimate.\n25.\tBut no rule has been the object of such flagrant discrimination in its application as the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States Members of the United Nations.\n26.\tThe principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States is enshrined in the political Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and has guided our policies in the most diverse situations. It would not be too much to ask other States which upon joining this Organization solemnly undertook to comply with the provisions of the Charter to apply to our country this same principle, the spirit of which is enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter, which speaks of practicing tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbors. We sincerely and deeply regret that in Zambia President Kaunda should maintain a fierce tribal discrimination, perhaps the worst kind of ethnic discrimination.\n27.\tWe are very much concerned with the fate of the Bembas and the Lumpas. We also hope that the economic policies of President Kaunda will not prevent the Zambians from acceding rapidly to the fruits of economic advancement. We firmly hope too that the majority of Zambians will come to enjoy in the future the self-determination to which they have an indisputable right and of which they have been unjustly deprived.\n28.\tHowever, despite these feelings, we have not arrogated unto ourselves the right of intervening in the internal affairs of that country. Neither have we sheltered, instigated or supported terrorists acting against it, nor have we proclaimed the inevitability of war against that African country. We scrupulously respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all our neighbors. But we consider that this attitude must be reciprocal.\n29.\tFor the last 11 years Portugal has been the victim of armed attacks unleashed by groups, organized, commanded, armed and based on foreign territory. The action of these groups, which indiscriminately attack the civilian populations and the authorities of our African Territories constitutes illegal terrorist activity. The support given to them from abroad, without which their actions would be impossible and would have ceased long ago, represents a flagrant violation of international law and of the principles and rules of the United Nations Charter.\n30.\tNotwithstanding this situation Portugal has displayed extreme moderation and a spirit of conciliation, by refraining from any retaliatory action, and renouncing the exercise of the right of self-defense, which would afford it the possibility of destroying the bases from which these armed attacks are launched. Portugal has acted in this manner because of its scrupulous respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the neighboring countries, and because it has not yet lost the hope that those countries will recognize the illegitimacy of their conduct and will come 10 accept the fundamental rules of peaceful coexistence. How many Member States in identical circumstances, and for such a long time, would have acted in this fashion? I wonder.\n\\\n31.\tIt is true that several times we have been accused of violating the borders of neighboring States, of attacking \ntheir territory, of threatening their security. But if those accusations were true, why should an impartial investigation of the facts always have been rejected, as has been the case in every specific instance?\n32.\tIf the authors of those accusations were not themselves convinced, as they are, of the complete lack of foundation of these charges why should they reject the setting up of border control commissions, which we have proposed, and which we again propose from this rostrum? If the African States, our neighbors, were not certain, as they are, that we do not represent any threat to their sovereignty and 'territorial integrity, why should they reject all the guarantees they have been offered and that we are ready to give them? Why should they refuse any and all conversations, negotiations or dialogs with us in this respect, while we have many times declared, and repeat today, that we are ready to' talk with them without any prior conditions? From those facts only one conclusion can be drawn: in all this business of the relations between Portugal and the African States bordering on our territories, and of peace and security in Africa, good faith and the Charter of the United Nations are solely and exclusively on the side of Portugal.\n33.\tAttempts have been made to justify and legitimize support for the terrorist movements operating in the Portuguese Territories on the strength of the argument that they represent the majority of the respective populations and are struggling against colonial oppression and against an authority in illegal occupation of their territory. But the fact that small minorities practice revolutionary armed action and terrorism all over the world today is forgotten. Armed action is not enough to give legitimacy to a movement as representing a population, even if a majority of States hostile to the country which is the victim of the attacks so claims. A subversive movement cannot be representative of a population when it operates solely in frontier areas and under cover of safe support from foreign countries. Their total and growing dependence on foreign support takes away all representative character from the anti-Portuguese terrorist movements, which, moreover, are opposed by the overwhelming majority of the population of their respective territories.\n34.\tWe are now being accused of making use of our African nationals in the defense of their lands. We accept this accusation. It is true. Over 50 per cent of all the forces defending the Portuguese Territories are African troops. And these numbers will constantly grow. What a strange accusation! Is it a crime for the inhabitants of a territory to take up arms in order to defend themselves against attacks launched against them from foreign soil? Is it a crime for a Government to furnish them with the means of protecting themselves from being massacred? And tomorrow> when in Portuguese Guinea all those defending the Portuguese cause turn out to be Africans and the Communist brigades attacking them are all made up of Cubans and other international bandits, will it still be said that this is a liberation movement and that the former is an army of occupation?\n35.\tIn order to try to justify the illegal support given to the subversive anti-Portuguese movements, it was necessary to invent the myth of the \\\"liberated areas\\\". The so-called liberation movements supposedly have under their control extensive zones in the Portuguese territories which supposedly constitute \\\"liberated areas\\\" and which they are supposedly administering. But if these movements, as we sometimes hear in this Organization, control two thirds of Portuguese Guinea, one third of Angola and one fifth of Mozambique, how can the Portuguese armed forces constitute a threat to peace and to the territorial integrity of the neighboring States? And why do these subversive movements find it necessary to maintain their bases and headquarters on foreign territory? Why do they fear frontier control and the respect of borders as dangerous to their activities? But here is a subject where arguments of logic are less valid than facts. An authority's control over a territory is proved by the fact of its control. And this is verified by direct observation. As the Portuguese Government knows that there is no \\\"liberated area\\\" in its overseas provinces, that there is no part of any of these territories where its authority is not legitimately constituted and exercised, or where its representatives are prevented from going wherever they want, it has addressed a formal invitation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to send a mission to verify, on the spot and whenever it wishes, the effective exercise of Portuguese sovereignty.\n36.\tSince this was an important matter of fact, one which some Members of this Organization viewed as controversial, it would have been normal for that invitation to be accepted. But no, it was declined. The United Nations is not interested in verifying the existence of the alleged liberated areas. Indeed, fictitious liberated areas and imaginary sovereignties can only be verified by invisible missions!\n37.\tTime does not permit me to dwell at length on this subject. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal has published and distributed in this Organization a detailed brochure which clarifies this important matter. And if I use this rostrum to publicize this publication, it is because in this field also we are the victims of total and unjust discrimination. The United Nations Office of Public Information, in violation of the principle of equal rights for all Member States and of equity itself, is being used as an instrument of extensive and fierce anti-Portuguese propaganda. This is how this Organization's funds are spent!\n38.\tPortugal, with its whole national territory as defined in the Portuguese political Constitution, was admitted to the United Nations as a Member State in 1955. Having admitted Portugal to membership, the United Nations recognized the territorial composition of the Portuguese State, as well as the constitutional statute of all its integral parts. And under Article 2 of the Charter, all Member States have the obligation to respect this composition. The fact that some countries do not consider our overseas territories as integral parts of Portugal and that they claim that they fall under Article 73 of the Charter does not give them the right either to seek to overturn by violent means the prevailing situation in Africa, or to become the instruments for the performance of acts contrary to international law and to the Charter itself.\n39.\tNotwithstanding these indisputable legal facts, an astonishing event took place in the United Nations a few days ago. At a meeting of one of the Committees of this\nAssembly, it was resolved to admit one does not know with what status, in what conditions and with what objective the presence of individuals who acknowledge themselves to be leaders of terrorist movements operating against Portuguese African Territories. A prior proposal by some delegations to request a legal opinion from the Secretariat was rejected by the majority. In this fashion, it was admitted and acknowledged that the United Nations is an Organization without law and without regulations, that law no longer counts.\n40.\tThe existence and the credibility of the United Nations itself is at issue in such proceedings. The fundamental reasons for its existence, its most basic principles and its most essential purposes are at stake. I do not want to indulge in rhetoric or assume an excessively dramatic tone but I will say that to destroy the Portuguese nation it would be necessary to begin by destroying international law and the very structure of international society. The Portuguese nation, thanks to the courageous resistance put up by its people, has not been destroyed. But the same does not happen to be the case with the rules of international law, which are constantly being eroded as a consequence of the arbitrary process followed in this Organization in dealing with the Portuguese case.\n41.\tPortugal refuses to accept that foreign countries or an international organization at the service of an inadmissible ideological imperialism should intervene in its internal affairs or presume to determine its future.\n42.\tBut, contrary to what has been widely said, Portugal does not reject the principle of self-determination. To reject the principle of self-determination would be tantamount to denying the essential dignity of man. As long ago as 1963, in conversations with representatives of African States, under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, we tried to explain how we interpreted self-determination. And the Secretary-General, in his report to the Security Council on these talks, said that Portugal did not deny the principle of self-determination.\n43.\tThe conclusion to be drawn from the manner in which the anti-Portuguese campaign has been conducted in the United Nations is that it is sought not to secure self-determination for the populations of the Portuguese overseas provinces of Africa, but to impose on Portugal, under the pretext of self-determination, a policy which is the equivalent of having the matter determined by foreigners. It would not be a question of our populations freely exercising their choice. Rather, it would be a question of forcing our populations to accept a choice imposed by outsiders or at least of creating conditions which would leave those populations no alternative but that. The doctrine is similar to the one formulated by the Indian Prime Minister Mr. Nehru, who, on 6 September 1955, told the Upper House of the Indian Parliament that the Portuguese must leave Goa, even if the Goans wish them to remain. This, too, is self-determination in the view of some Members of the United Nations.\n44.\tAs far as Portugal is concerned, the right to self-determination is the prerogative of all men and of all societies. But it is a right that must be exercised without any outside interference even of the United Nations and through the means best suited to each case.\n45.\tPortugal is proud of the creation of the great Brazilian nation and participated in a privileged and fraternal position in the ceremonies marking the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence.\n46.\tBut Portugal has never brought into existence, nor will it ever bring into existence, white independence or black independence. The unity of the Portuguese nation is the mainstay and the guarantee of the multiracial society which we have built up in Africa. Unless it is integrated in the Portuguese nation, that multiracial society would obviously disappear. And could it be that this very result is the objective of the opponents of Portuguese policies?\n47.\tContrary to what is so often said, Portugal is not opposed to decolonization. We view with sympathy the efforts of the Governments of young independent African States to consolidate their nations a task that encompasses the struggle against underdevelopment, against foreign economic domination and against the outbreak of tribal rivalries, while at the same time ensuring the genuine political and economic integration of the great mass of their populations in accordance with the objectives and living standard desired by the elites which at present are governing these States. The Portuguese are engaged in similar tasks. We devote to these tasks our experience, our vast geographical horizons and our ethnically and culturally richly varied human elements. In the face of the decolonization movement, Portugal can well consider itself rich in possibilities and prospects.\n48.\tThe objectives and the realities of Portuguese policies in Africa compel us to reject as unfounded the criticism leveled against us in this Organization. The overseas provinces of Portugal are not and have never been dependencies of the European part of Portugal. The system of legal, political, social and ethnic values is the same throughout the Portuguese territory. That is why we find it difficult to understand that this system should be labeled as colonial, since the colonial system is essentially a system of dependency, subordination and economic exploitation of one territory for the benefit of another, under the same sovereignty. There is nothing like that in the Portuguese system. Therefore, it is not surprising that we reject the label of colonialists, because our system is, and has always been, different.\n49.\tAs I said, we have our system of values. We are ready to explain it and to discuss it. There will certainly be some points which will be accepted by our critics. For example, contrary to what was happening 10 years ago obviously through lack of information today nobody questions the sincerity of our multi-racialism or, rather, the racial equality which we practice.\n50.\tIn view of the interest of certain delegations which follow the matter closely, I should like to say a few words about the most recent developments concerning our overseas provinces. I am not unaware of the fact that the events which stir the greatest interest are those of a political nature.\n51.\tPortuguese policies have not remained static, as is sometimes erroneously believed, perhaps because they move along the lines of the orientation of the Portuguese system, which, I repeat, is based on national unity. Within this system, the Portuguese Constitution was revised last year. Many changes were brought about, the most important ones relating to our overseas provinces. The purpose of the constitutional revision was essentially to give effect to the Portuguese Government's orientation towards progressive autonomy for the overseas provinces.\n52.\tThe principles enunciated in the Constitution concerning the policy and administration of the overseas territories, in keeping with a policy of decentralization, are the following:\n(a)\tThe existence of special statutes for the provinces as autonomous regions;\n(b)\tThe designation of \\\"State\\\", when the advancement of the social milieu and the complexity of its administration justifies such a classification (this designation has already been granted to Angola and Mozambique while the Portuguese State of India always had it);\n(c)\tTheir own political and administrative organization adapted to their geographical situation and state of development.\n53.\tThe autonomy of each overseas province is set out in the following manner: the existence of elective governing bodies; the right to legislate; the right to ensure, through its own governing bodies, the implementation of laws and the carrying out of internal administration; financial autonomy consisting of the right to approve the provincial budget; the right to have a specific economic system appropriate to the needs of development and the well-being of the population.\n54.\tAs far as the bodies exercising provincial powers are concerned, while the Governor is appointed by the central Government, the others, that is the legislative assemblies, must necessarily be elected locally. It is the central Government's duty to watch over the general interests of the overseas Territories, to ensure their international representation and their defense and to legislate on matters of common interest. The central Government also supervises their fiscal administration and management and protects the population against threats or attempts against their individual or collective rights. This last constitutional provision is of the utmost importance and reflects a basic idea expressed by our Prime Minister, Marcello Caetano:\n\\\"If any segregationist tendencies sKould manifest themselves locally, they will be inexorably combated by the intervention of the central Government, should this prove\nnecessary. We shall not give up our intention to persevere in the building of multiracial societies and we shall not compromise as regards the maintenance of a single statute for all Portuguese, whatever their race or color.\\\"\n55.\tThus the Constitution permits an ample, effective autonomy in the provinces. The intention of the Portuguese Government is progressively to promote the enlargement of this autonomy while ensuring at the same time the participation of the entire population of each of the provinces in self-government. In keeping with this orientation a new organic law for the overseas Territories, common to all the provinces, was promulgated this year, and the approval of new statutes for each province will soon be undertaken. The provincial legislative assemblies will be made up of elected members. Their composition and the mode of election of their members will guarantee adequate representation for all citizens. The powers of the legislative assemblies, at the provincial level, will to a certain extent parallel the powers of the central Parliament at the national level.\n56.\tThe organic law opens up new opportunities for the local elites, enhances the importance of the provincial legislative organs and creates institutional cadres which go far to meet the deep aspirations of the people in keeping with the realities of the progress and political maturity of these populations. We shall pursue without faltering our policies of economic development and social progress, so that all the inhabitants of the overseas provinces may acquire the moral and technical qualifications needed for the discharge of political functions. It has been stated in these halls\u2014I do not know on what basis-that each school we build is \\\"a crime against humanity\\\". If that is so, I confess that we have committed thousands of \\\"crimes\\\" of that kind, and we shall continue relentlessly to commit many more, for we assign the greatest importance to the spread of education at all levels, seeking to take it to the most remote populations. Since 1960 we have more than doubled school attendance in all the overseas provinces.\n57.\tAnyone visiting our overseas provinces will be able to observe new works in progress in the field of infrastructures, communications, electric power, industry and agriculture. I shall mention here only the colossal enterprises of Cunene and Cabora Bassa, which, according to some, are two other \\\"crimes against humanity\\\" which we are committing. I remember in this connexion that a few years ago we were being accused of not promoting the economic development of our overseas provinces. Today this development generally surpasses the levels achieved in other parts of the African continent. But since our efforts cannot be denied, anti-Portuguese propaganda has had to change its tune, which shows that no matter what we do we shall always be the object of some criticism. It is important to emphasize that our efforts at economic and social development are being made without any external assistance, a fact that renders even more significant our levels of development and their comparison with those other Territories. In truth Portugal can legitimately consider itself to be the only country in the world with Territories in the process of development which is receiving \\\"negative aid\\\" from the international community.\n58.\tI should like nothing more than to dwell at length on the fascinating subject of the economic and social development taking place in our overseas provinces,, but time presses and I must end.\n59.\tIn order to justify the support of violence and terrorism in our African territories it is alleged that Portugal refuses to enter into a dialog and that it practices repression in its overseas Territories.\n60.\tOur defense activities will cease the moment aggression from abroad ceases. Not long ago the Portuguese Government made a solemn appeal, followed by broad and concrete measures of clemency, to all Portuguese Africans who had allowed themselves to be enticed by subversive movements to return to peaceful life and 1.0 collaborate in the progress and the development of their Territories.\n61.\tEven though we have already done so in the past, I hereby renew our invitations to African countries to send their representatives to visit our overseas provinces where they will get all the information they want about living conditions in those Territories. We are ready to start a dialog with them concerning our concepts, our realities and our plans.\n62.\tWe have also expressed our readiness to conclude with the African countries non-aggression pacts and agreements for the peaceful solution of any existing bilateral problems. I again renew that offer.\n63.\tSimilarly, I renew our offer to our neighboring countries to set up, by mutual agreement, joint border control commissions.\n64.\tI also renew the invitation addressed to the Secretariat of the United Nations, in the terms and conditions already communicated to them, to send qualified observers to Portuguese Guinea so that in the light of day and in comfort and safety they may verify in all parts of the Territory they might wish to visit who it is that exercises effectively the powers of administration. At this time I extend the same invitation for visits to the States of Angola and Mozambique.\n65.\tThe preparatory work for a European conference on security and co-operation will begin shortly. If such a conference is considered possible and desirable in Europe, where there are different political, economic and social systems, why could not the same principles as are at the basis of that conference apply to Africa? Could there be any interest in fostering conflicts in Africa so that the continent might fall prey more easily to economic and ideological neo-colonialism?\n66.\tWe offer to all African countries our entire co-operation and collaboration in the great tasks whose implementation in Africa and in other continents should be of interest to the United Nations in this decade of the 1970s: peace, economic development, social advancement, the elimination of all forms of discrimination and unjust inequalities among men. All the resources of our Territories will be available for collaborating towards these ends.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a pleasant duty for me to congratulate you on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Upper Volta on your brilliant election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You are eminently qualified for the post. There is no doubt that, thanks to the wisdom and experience for which you are known, the work of the present session will be crowned with success. I would assure you that, in the accomplishment of the delicate task that has been entrusted to you, you may fully reply upon the collaboration of my delegation.\n18.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, who as President of the twenty-sixth session gave us the benefit of his wisdom and rich experience.\n19.\tI would also address the warmest congratulations of my Government to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has taken office in an unstable world in which violence and injustice and the disparity in development between States constitute the most urgent threats to the future of our civilization. The United Nations needs men who have faith in it, and Mr. Kurt Waldheim is such a man, as was his predecessor, U Thant, to whom I wish to pay a tribute for his great work as Secretary-General of this Organization for a whole decade.\n20.\tMay I likewise on behalf of my delegation pay a tribute to the memory of the late Paul-Henri Spaak, who was President of the first session of the General Assembly. He was a great statesman who unceasingly proclaimed his faith in the United Nations.\n21.\tIn considering the agenda of the present session, what surprises and astonishes us most is the presence indeed, L might say the permanent presence of a large number of items that have already been examined by this Assembly at a number of previous sessions. This state of affairs rapidly leads us to pessimism and to doubt, because what can one truly feel if not a sense of failure in the face of the paucity of practical results obtained by the United Nations over the past few years in its fundamental task of maintaining international peace and security? The trouble-spots that subsist or break out, the injustices born of colonial domination or racial discrimination, the feeling of frustration of peoples who have the painful impression that they have been left out because of the wastage brought about by war, military domination and the arms race these are the melancholy realities that lead us to pessimism.\n22.\tUpper Volta and a large number of small and medium-sized countries are and always will be available to turn the United Nations into an institution in the service of peace, justice, progress and the freedom of peoples. The experience of the past few years has shown that it is these small countries which the great Powers often for uncharitable or dubious purposes like to designate by the term \\\"irresponsible majority\\\". It is these small and medium-sized Powers that are the sap of the United Nations. In them can be found the faith and enthusiasm that presided over the birth of our Organization.\n23.\tIf today the United Nations has in various circumstances given the impression of an ineffective, even passive, organism, it is because after a quarter of a century of participation in the Organization that enthusiasm has worn off some of its Members, which may be understandable. But what the small Powers such as Upper Volta have difficulty in understanding and accepting is that great Powers are trying to divert the United Nations from its true vocation to the exclusive defense of their own interests.\n24.\tThis state of affairs does not, of course, lead us to question the importance or utility of the United Nations, because, apart from the forum it represents for the examination of the problems of our times, this Organization remains invested with a historic responsibility based upon the need to build a world where fruitful relations between human beings and Governments depend on peace, the recognition of fundamental human rights, the freedom of peoples still under colonial domination, and a constant quest for economic and social progress. Of course, the obstacles blocking the attainment of that noble purpose are numerous and sometimes unforeseeable. The composition of this Assembly, which reflects a complex world, is not the least of these.\n25.\tAt this session this Assembly will see the confrontation of ideologies and interests. Unanimity will be difficult to achieve on a large number of questions. Nevertheless let us have the courage to rise above ourselves. Let us see to it that the United Nations does not become a synonym for failure, as was the defunct League of Nations. The Charter is an appeal addressed to all the peoples of the world, asking them to work together in order to build peace and international security.\n26.\tWe must acknowledge that at the beginning of this session an analysis of the facts does not allow us to show any optimism. Indeed, throughout the world tragedies are being played out, sowing suffering, mourning and ruin among innocent populations. By an irony of fate violence and injustice take place in the poorest continents.\n27.\tWhat, then, can one say concerning the persistence of colonial situations in Africa? The General Assembly and the Security Council have had to consider colonialism in Africa for a number of years. Numerous resolutions, and in particular resolution 1514 (XV), on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, have been adopted without the proponents of colonialism yielding on any point. They have refused to abandon positions they have inherited from past systematic exploitation of the African continent. The international order the United Nations defends should not accept this situation. Everything should be set in motion by the world community to eradicate any domination in Africa and elsewhere.\n28.\tIn referring to colonialism, it is especially to Portugal that we turn once again. Portugal's will to maintain itself through repression in Angola and Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) makes no sense whatever today. It is erroneous and Utopian for Portugal to believe that it will withstand the struggle for national liberation on which the populations of these countries have embarked.\n29.\tWhat we find most distressing is that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] which on numerous occasions have proved their devotion to the sacred principle of the freedom of peoples provide considerable assistance to Portugal, thus making it possible for it to pursue its colonial war.\n30.\tIt seems to me that the time has come for Portugal to enter into a healthy discussion with those who have risen in order to recover their freedom and dignity, so as to find solutions to problems which weapons have thus far been unable to solve.\n31.\tTo the States which grant their support to Portugal, we say that they are wrong to do so, because this people is clinging to a lost cause: moribund colonialism. From the United Nations, over and above the resolutions, we now ask for concrete action in favor of the liberation movements in colonized Africa because these are proceeding from victory to victory and control vast expanses of their territory which had been under foreign domination.\n32.\tFor our part, we affirm once again that we shall not cease to work for the total liberation of the African continent from the colonial yoke, both in the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ and as well as in this Assembly.\n33.\tNow, I come to southern Africa: colonialism and racism constitute a threat to international peace and security in that region.\n34.\tIn Rhodesia we were going to say in Zimbabwe-it is almost seven years since Ian Smith and his band defied the international community and the United Kingdom by deliberately choosing illegality. In the face of the unfortunate ineffectiveness of the international action, still being undertaken by the United Kingdom, the white racists of Rhodesia are gradually giving hatred and racial separation the status of a system, aided in this by South Africa and Portugal. The black population of Rhodesia has clearly manifested its rejection of white domination by turning down the Anglo-Rhodesian \\\"proposals for a settlement\\\" of November 1971.  In view of the impasses, the honorable solution for the United Kingdom and for all concerned would consist in convening as soon as possible a national constitutional conference with the participation of the authentic political representatives of the Rhodesian people to resolve together the problems of Rhodesia. As for the international community, it can make a positive contribution to the restoration of legality and justice in Rhodesia by stringently applying the sanctions decided upon by the Security Council; we are aware that unfortunately this is not the case, inasmuch as results show that the sanctions decided on by the Council as far back as June 1968 in its resolution 253 (1968) have been a failure and have thus far been unable to bring down the Ian Smith regime. My country regrets that a super-Power-the United States of America a permanent member of the Security Council, is setting a bad example by purchasing chrome from Rhodesia.\n35.\tIn the case of Namibia, a mission was entrusted to the Secretary-General by the Security Council in its resolution 309 (1972) adopted at its meetings in Addis Ababa in February. That mission has now been extended. My country is not accustomed to passing a priori judgment upon the efforts of the Security Council concerning any given situation. Nevertheless, the known facts, in particular the conduct of the policy which is that of the \\\"national homes\\\", cannot prevent us from having doubts concerning the real desire of South Africa to co-operate with the United Nations.\n36.\tIt goes without saying that, independently of the present mission of the Secretary-General-which is one attempt among so many others-the international community must continue and intensify its efforts to help, by appropriate means, the Namibian people to reach independence in unity and in territorial integrity.\n37.\tIn South Africa still, human rights continue to be flouted through a system that has been universally condemned, and I am referring to apartheid. That doctrine of white supremacy is absurd and we shall condemn it ceaselessly. It is unthinkable that in the midst of the twentieth century individuals should invoke racial supremacy in order to oppress others. Recent history has shown the grave dangers for the peace and the future of mankind inherent in such doctrines. International opinion has condemned apartheid This Assembly has declared that that system is a crime against humanity. The racist authorities of Pretoria have embarked upon a vast campaign of propaganda in order to rid themselves of their guilt in the face of this unanimous condemnation. The failure of that campaign proves that the policy of racial discrimination practiced by South Africa is indefensible. The responsibilities vested in this Organization require of all its Members a responsible attitude towards the problem of apartheid; in other words, the acquiescence, nay, the complicity of certain great Powers members of the Security Council with respect to South Africa give the peoples of Africa grounds for concern.\n38.\tLately, however, there have been some encouraging events in the world. First of all, within this very Organization, the presence of the People's Republic of China is a major step towards the universality prescribed by the Charter. TTiis event is demonstrably a prime mover in the international detente of which the visit of President Nixon to Peking is an example. In Asia we were pleased to note the historic decision taken by the two Koreas in order to bring about the peaceful and independent unification of that country divided, as it has been, for almost a quarter of a century.\n39.\tFurthermore, in Europe the ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and between the Federal Republic and Poland, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, pending the conference on European security, are also so many additional elements of international detente. But we cannot overlook the fact that the clash between the ideologies and the ambitions of States in that region led to two world wars, and we must say how encouraged we are by the new atmosphere of detente and co-operation which is emerging there.\n40.\tIf all peace-loving nations have seen a glimmer of hope in these events, there are still serious problems facing the international community.\n41.\tIn addition to incomplete decolonization, we now have centers of tension and crises, all of which represent particularly dangerous situations throughout the world. For five years the Middle East has attracted the attention of world public opinion. For five years we have heard mention of the peaceful solution; and yet, thus far, no solution for peace has been found. We must state again that it is not realistic to challenge the existence of a State, regardless of which it is, in that region; furthermore the acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible and must be condemned. However, the more time passes, the more difficult the problem becomes to solve; peace must be achieved as soon as possible. Thus, we have always been convinced that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is still a sound basis for the settlement of the conflict. We at the OAU have also tried to make our modest contribution to the implementation of that resolution. Unfortunately, the Committee of African Heads of State, the 10 wise men of Africa, encountered the same obstacles as the Jarring mission, namely, the refusal by one of the parties to accept the terms of resolution 242 (1967).\n42.\tIn South-East Asia, the same tragedy is being played out. The populations of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos are at one and the same time the protagonists and the victims of a tragedy which is beyond their control.\n43.\tWe are particularly conscious of Viet-Nam, where an entire generation has known nothing but war and all the miseries in its train. The road to peace is still long, but we must admit that any solution to Viet-Nam must rest on the choice by the people of Viet-Nam of the political system that they desire without foreign pressure or interference.\n44.\tThe Indian subcontinent was shaken a year ago by a fratricidal war; it is encouraging to see now that peace has been restored in that region. We pay a tribute to the wisdom of the parties to that conflict which allowed the Simla Agreement of 3 July to be concluded.\n45.\tThe building and strengthening of international peace and security are closely linked to the achievement of progress towards general and complete disarmament.\n46.\tThis Assembly last year took up eight points relating to disarmament, and that is a good indication of our concern over this problem. But we must admit that a certain discouragement and lassitude has taken over our minds in the light of the meager practical results obtained in the conferences, documents and statements made. In the meantime, the two super-Powers and I am thinking here of the United States and the Soviet Union continued quantitatively and qualitatively to develop and improve formidable weapons, and the smaller countries are perfectly justified in wondering fearfully to what ends these weapons will be put. Hence we welcomed with relief the Agreement for a limitation of the strategic arms race, arrived at in Moscow in May 1972 between the two super-Powers.  We should like to believe that that Agreement is the first step in a deescalation that will banish once and for all the prospects of a nuclear war. We would also hope that the two great Powers will not rest on their laurels but will continue to ponder the question of disarmament because as we hardly need to remind you the survival of our civilization is at stake.\n47.\tThe survival of our civilization is not only threatened by the arms race but also and perhaps even more so by disparities in economic development. In this field, the responsibility for the effort to be be made lies first and foremost with the developing countries. Unfortunately, in many sectors this effort is checked by foreign forces which are entirely outside the control of the developing countries. The success of the International Development Strategy lies in the capacity of the poor nations to control these external forces, and the aim of international co-operation is to assist them to achieve that control. We appeal particularly to the wealthy countries, which represent 25 per cent of the world's population but which own 80 per cent of its wealth, to become aware of the role they have to play in the economic future of the developing countries. In this respect, the third session of UNCTAD, held at Santiago in April and May, is the best yardstick for measuring the evolution which has taken place since the second session at New Delhi in 1968. With some chagrin we are forced to recognize that the economic and trade system of the world is far from having undergone the qualitative changes indispensable to the establishment of a new system which would be more equitable towards the third world, and is thus less likely to assist their efforts towards economic and social development. The third session at Santiago has indeed showed that in trade matters the intention was to reject out of hand the requests of the developing countries for a total liberation of exchanges in their favor, for a share in the market for commodities competing with those of the developed countries and for a price policy through international agreements.\n48.\tThe developed countries preferred to refer all these matters to the trade negotiations to be held in 1973 within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], whereas the experience of the Kennedy Round has clearly shown that at that level the main action consists of mutual concessions between the wealthy countries to the detriment of the interests of the third world.\n49.\tUpper Volta remains convinced that as long as an appropriate solution is not found to these questions within UNCTAD, the international community, in particular the developing countries, has no chance of achieving the targets set in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], because, in fact, the developed countries would continue to take back through trade more than they give through technical and financial assistance and the imbalance of the operation will remain in their favor.\n50.\tTo illustrate this bad faith, we only have to mention the lack of agreement on coffee, the uncertainties about a sugar agreement and so on. In this connexion Upper Volta, like its neighboring countries, was disagreeably surprised one morning in August to note that we had been forced to purchase a kilo of sugar at 110 CFA francs as opposed to 80 CFA francs, which had been the price the day before. Our countries are therefore nothing but pawns in the hands of the financial magnates, and the indignant populations are powerless to stop this exploitation. Such plunder must cease, at all costs.\n51.\tOn the financial level, the participation of the third world in seeking solutions to the present monetary crisis seems to be an accepted principle; we are gratified at the recognition albeit a tardy one-of the need to give the third world a voice in negotiations on a problem which affects it just as much, if not more, than it affects the wealthy countries.\n52.\tWith regard to the supply of public and private resources for development, the developing countries have expressed their disquiet at the net reduction of the total volume of capital flow and the failure to reach the target of 1 per cent set by the Strategy. There have been very few actions aimed at improving terms for the granting of aid and, in particular, for \\\"untying\\\" aid.\n53.\tFurthermore, the cost of debt servicing has increased very rapidly, thereby decreasing the importing capacity of the developing countries. Upper Volta hopes that UNCTAD will set up an organization to investigate ways and means of lightening the debt load of the developing countries.\n54.\tThe connexion between special drawing rights and supplementary financing of development has yet to be determined, and the reason for this is the lack of goodwill of the wealthy countries.\n55.\tConcerning the special measures to assist the least developed countries and the additional measures to assist land-locked countries, I think some gratification can be expressed on the results achieved. However, that is but a document that is worth only the value the signatories place on it. In other words, the measures envisaged to assist the less advanced countries have to be implemented for the international community to decide whether it can state objectively that this was one of the rare successes of the meetings at Santiago.\n56.\tWe do not need to reiterate our position on the different aspects of these special measures. We have already done so in many forums these past years. The international community in general, and the developed countries and the international institutions in particular have before them a document which is the result of mutual concessions and which is accepted by all. It is now a question of translating these declarations of intention and the acceptance of the resolution into specific and immediate actions.\n57.\tThus, if after more than 25 years, the United Nations can claim credit for a large number of achievements, this Organization still has serious shortcomings: the persistence of colonial regimes, the bastions of racial discrimination, the fact that many crises are kept out of the United Nations or solved outside it, inequality in economic and social development of peoples-all show that the United Nations have not always or not yet lived up to our hopes. In this connexion we do not believe it fair to blame the Charter and to connect the ineffectiveness of the United Nations with its review. No human undertaking is perfect, and the Charter cannot be an exception to this principle.\n58.\tWhat stands in the way of our Organization acting in a dynamic and effective way is the lack of will on the part of certain Member States to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and other organs.\n59.\tUpper Volta believes in peace and in the need for international security and we should like to reiterate our confidence in the immense possibilities of this Organization through the concerted action of all its Members. It is true that today the general interest continues more often than not to be subordinated to selfish interests. But we have the duty to rise above all this and to be worthy of the mission which the peoples of the world have entrusted to us, namely, to work towards the achievement of an era of peace, justice and equality among men.\n"

It is an election that constitutes the best guarantee for success in the conduct of this session of the General Assembly.\n145.\tSince this is the first opportunity that the Revolutionary Nationalist Government of Ecuador has had to make known its views to the General Assembly, I should like in general to indicate our main goals.\n146.\tThe Government of Ecuador wishes to effect a profound economic and social transformation of the country and to overcome the present state of backwardness and poverty in which the great majority of the people live; and we intend to do this by establishing social justice, which will ensure wide participation by all the national sectors and regions by bringing into the mainstream of the life of the country all those who have been on the fringes and by encouraging an increased and maximum utilization of the natural resources in order to achieve national objectives.\n147.\tMy Government hopes to achieve these objectives through responsible and planned action. This will obviously call for vigorous activity on the part both of the State and of private enterprise, but there will of course be a guarantee of individual rights, defense and encouragement of the rights of workers and respect for capital and investments so long as they carry out their social function. Ecuador shares the desires and aspirations of Latin America and the third world, and offers co-operation in the fulfillment of the objectives of the United Nations.\n148.\tEcuador, which from the very beginning of its independence has been known for its love for peace and justice, is deeply concerned over the fact that, despite the years that have elapsed and the efforts made, there are still in existence dangerous centers of friction that belie the purposes expressed by nations when they created this Organization, which was to do away with acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace and encourage friendly relations on the principle of legal equality among States.\n149.\tIt is true that if we glance back at the past and go through the pages of history where law was the law of the strongest and where acts were arbitrary, it appears to be just to recognize that the achievements of the United Nations in the few years of its existence are valuable and the balance positive. But even this is not entirely satisfactory in the light of the hunger for calm and security which the peoples of the world are experiencing, peoples who wish to live free from fear and worry, working their land or carrying out their duties without the specter of misery hovering over them and protected from the scourge of war. We must eliminate once and for all and proscribe forever the resort to force as a solution of disputes or conflicts, for that is why we have raised the peaceful solution of controversies to an ineluctable principle.\n150.\tBut there appear to be interests that threaten these aims and undermine these principles in order to keep conflicts alive, very often artificially, and viciously creating situations which lead to breaches of the peace because, by using such confrontations, they obtain economic or political advantages or they can test new instruments of war, while in their egotistical plans they set no store by human life or the sufferings of displaced populations who are bereft of their homes and cities. But this can no longer continue. General indifference or cold complacency must yield place to active condemnation, to energetic protests, to clearly defined positions which will reveal the existence of a clear and definitive desire to disavow or repudiate such acts, a feeling that must gain ground until it is shared by all the world and so becomes the symbol of our times and replaces the fatal complacency that was the hallmark of earlier ages. To that end we must work and in this crusade we must make every effort so that in the immediate future we will perfect an attitude more in keeping with the principles that must distinguish us as eager to live in peace as good neighbors, concerned only with encouraging progress and raising the standard of living of citizens all over the world.\u2003\n151.\tAt most we might say that within this balance of terror created by the new and modern means of mass destruction we have been able to avert another world-wide conflagration, but other conflicts are kept alive or break out that are still grave disturbances to world peace even though localized. After many years of suffering and endless misery, in a true war of extermination, Viet-Nam is still fighting, tom by sorrow, sacrifice and death. It is imperative that that situation end. At least, it is encouraging to know that conversations which might well lead to the end of that brutal war are being started.\n152.\tThe Middle East, with its already too long-lasting problems, quite justifiably has attracted very special attention from the international community. We must admit that the United Nations has shown deep concern for that complex situation and has devoted much of its time to the discussion and adoption of resolutions in order to solve the problems in a manner that is just and satisfactory to all parties concerned. I cannot fail to refer to the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which we believe constitutes a basis for the solution of the problem. It is the resolution that led to the Jarring mission, which is still trying to bring together the wills of the parties to the dispute. Among countries with such a long historical tradition, countries the splendor of whose cultures has been a source of inspiration for the development of all Western culture, it is most sad that the play of the interests of the super-Powers should maintain a climate so unconducive to constructive dialog. Ecuador condemns the unleashing of acts of violence and of force wherever they may occur because we recognize the supremacy of law and therefore urge a peaceful solution and a just settlement according to the unchanging truth that war creates no rights, but that the solution must eliminate from relations among peoples the threat or the use of force.\n153.\tEcuador reaffirms the right of Israel to a recognized and secure existence where its great, hard-working and enterprising people can live its life in safety and with faith in its future. We believe also that the Arab nations have the right to recover their own territories.\n154.\tAs far as my Government is concerned terrorist practices are to be condemned whatever their origin. For that reason my country has always condemned-and we repeat today most energetically that we are against-any attack on the integrity of States as well as against human persons. My country officially proclaimed a few days ago that \\\"terrorist acts have deserved and will always receive from the Government of Ecuador a most energetic repudiation.\\\" Consistent with that formal declaration, Ecuador is convinced that, as soon as possible, there should be laid down international norms that will prevent and punish acts of this nature.\n155.\tConfronted as we are by these painful facts, we are, however, encouraged to find that there are positive events that promise a reduction of tensions and the beginnings of constructive dialog. We are gratified that the great Powers have initiated contacts that have made possible the \\\"new balance of prudence\\\", as the Secretary-General has called it in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l, p. 1]. This dialog will doubtless make it easier to arrive at the desired understandings and the more active co-operation from which mankind expects so much. There is always a common denominator which makes understanding and coexistence possible even in the case of contrasting views.\n156.\tFrom this standpoint and thanks to the agreements arrived at last year among the four Powers, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic are coming closer to understandings, on the basis of one nation and two States, and these will exert a favorable influence on Central European peace and will contribute significantly to the holding of the planned conference on European security, which will doubtless in turn be another step towards the consolidation of world peace.\n157.\tIt is also most encouraging that South and North Korea have started a constructive dialog, which has already led to agreement on certain points, as shown by their Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 [A/8727, annex 1].\n158.\tAll this is most auspicious and promises that gradually we may be able to fulfill one of the fundamental bases of the world Organization that is, universality. If thus far many factors have hindered that universality, it now is true that we can glimpse substantive changes that will make of this Organization the parliament of all the peoples of the world.\n159.\tThe existence of colonial systems and regimes is an affront to the principle of universality. This is a matter that has warranted and will continue to receive special attention on the part of the Ecuadorean Government. By historic tradition and democratic conviction, we have always opposed any political system that denies basic principles such as those of self-determination and self-government, to which all peoples of this world have a right. Consistent with that position, in all international organizations and at every stage through which this problem has passed in the United Nations, we have expressed our rejection of colonialism, which hampers the freedom of peoples, is a point of obvious friction among members of the international community and harbors dangers to international peace and security. My Government is convinced that the age of colonialism must once and for all be outlawed. That is why we would support any step that would lead to the political independence of the peoples of the Territories that are still under the colonial yoke and have still not been given an opportunity to express themselves freely. We recognize their right to become free and independent nations pursuant to the terms of the Charter and the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations.\n160.\tContinuing with my list of imperfections which unfortunately still beset humanity despite the passage of centuries and the evolution of ideas and concepts, we must mention two stains that are still on the nations' conscience. They are racism in general and its specific form apartheid. My delegation believes that these two phenomena are not only anachronistic but also a violation, of elementary legal tenets, because it is, absurd that human beings should be differentiated on the basis of the color of their skins or that they should be discriminated against because of their race, the religion they practice or the language they speak. \n\nSurely more specific and effective action must be taken to put a final end to those practices that contradict and belie the letter and spirit of the Charter.\n161.\tWhen speaking of the protection of the inalienable rights of man, we might well link these with scientific and technological progress and their economic and social repercussions. The wide gap between the developed and the developing nations, far from narrowing, daily becomes greater, emphasizing the differences between the two groups. And instead of these facts attracting the careful attention of the wealthy nations, it would appear that those nations have adopted an annoying disdain not in keeping with human solidarity or the obligation incumbent on the super-industrialized nations to channel constant and increasing assistance from the rich to the poor. While the former enrich themselves by almost geometric progressions, the latter become proportionately poorer. My country thus believes that the correct application of human rights and the respect and consideration all human beings deserve dictates that scientific and technological progress should be placed at the service of the less favored peoples so that the benefits of science will assist them too, as it has assisted others, substantially to raise their standard of living. Particularly in agricultural countries, it is necessary to modernize the cultivation systems so that the fields will yield in proportion to the effort made and thus benefit the entire community. The lack of scientific training and technological means has delayed the changes in structure that would enable these countries to keep up with present progress and meet present needs, and therefore the poorer countries face this new obstacle to their progress. But there, too, lies the responsibility of the technologically advanced countries to provide them with assistance in keeping with such requirements. To give an example, the present situation in my own country is highly interesting because we have started exporting oil, which was discovered a short time ago in the subsoil of our Amazonian region. It is our just desire to take full advantage of that wealth for the benefit of the entire Ecuadorean people, but in this as in other fields it is urgent that adequate technology be transferred to allow us to make maximum use of our natural resources and to assist the legitimate owners of this \\\"black gold\\\".\n162.\tTo the lack of technology in our developing countries, we add the lack of the financial means for planning and implementing our programs for development in our fight against poverty, unsanitary conditions, disease and illiteracy. Thus the contrast becomes even more obvious when, in the light of so many needs, we know that the arms race has been neither contained nor stemmed. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General has purposefully stated: \\\"In fact, the arms race has spiraled to a level higher than ever before ... total world expenditure for these purposes has risen to about $200,000 million annually\\\" [A/8701lAdd.l, p. 3]. We know that this is one of the most important questions confronting the Organization. In its solution, many adverse factors must be overcome. But we also recognize that, because of that very fact, it must be tackled with decision and honesty in order to find a solution in keeping with the security which all hope for and which would be compatible with the co-operation that binds us all. It is, I know, not a matter that can be solved overnight. It is both urgent and necessary that good will be shown and that open minds be brought to bear so that, with sincerity and an understanding of the responsibilities, the way to tackle and solve the problem can be devised.\n163.\tIn its resolution 2833 (XXVI), the General Assembly expressed the vital interest of the international community in finding effective means whereby to achieve general disarmament and-for obvious reasons, of course-nuclear disarmament. With full knowledge of its historic responsibility, the United Nations will this year again devote itself to considering this question when dealing with agenda item 26, on a World Disarmament Conference.\n164.\tOne of the fundamental postulates of my country is that Ecuador is a peace-loving nation, one that condemns violence. We have therefore been gravely concerned over the arms race that is one of the features of many of the nations of the world and therefore we wish to stress the importance we attach to the consideration of the disarmament item. My Government is fully aware of the complexity of the problem whose solution will be the result of a series of efforts and proposals on which all parties concerned will have to have agreed previously, beginning by the establishment of trust in international relations and belief in the value of international justice. My country also recognizes that these will be long and arduous negotiations with not a few setbacks, but we consider that, by the same token, it will be possible to achieve success if there is the will to reach understandings that will be beneficial to all mankind. We cannot begin at the end and therefore we recognize that we will have to deal prudently with the subject in order to arrive at a negotiated solution to the problem of disarmament. From all I have said it can be gathered that my Government considers it indispensable that the World Disarmament Conference should be held because doubtless it will be an historic milestone on the difficult road to the strengthening of tolerance in order to achieve harmonious coexistence among all peoples of this planet.\n165.\tIt is only just to recognize that some progress has been made regarding the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, despite the fact that the tests of these devices still continue, either in the atmosphere or underground. Ecuador has repeatedly spoken out against explosions and nuclear experiments that the super-Powers have carried out without weighing the danger of radioactive fall-out and the destructive effect of such explosions. My own and 15 other countries of the hemisphere are parties to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America because of this concern; that Treaty created an organism to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction from our continent and to implement the resolutions, declarations and purposes that define the position and the policies of Latin American nations on this important question. The concern- that Ecuador has shown regarding the continuation of nuclear weapons and our awareness of the dangerous consequences to mankind of these tests have led my country at this time, from this General Assembly, to make a determined appeal to the great Powers to put an end to such nuclear explosions and tests and rather devote those immense resources of both moneys and techniques to research which, placed at the service of man, will cure his diseases and help him in his economic and social development and assure him of an existence more in keeping with his dignity.\n166.\tThe same guiding idea of protecting man in all his aspects and manifestations inspired and dictated the position of Ecuador in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which was held in June of this year in Stockholm. My country is deeply concerned over the problems of the environment. The more we know of these problems and the better we understand them, the more we are aware of their gravity and the urgency of finding an adequate solution to them. Convinced of this, Ecuador gave whole-hearted support to the holding of the Stockholm Conference since we were determined to try to blaze new trails in the history of mankind with the hope that we might find adequate formulas that would harmonize accelerated development which characterizes this century and links us with the environmental problems, as well as the highly noble task of shortening the distance which so greatly separates the super-wealthy from the poor countries of the world.\n167.\tOur view was and is that we must endeavor to find the ways and means to true international co-operation, without tutor nations and without subject nations, since that would contradict the spirit and the letter of our Charter-co-operation of a nature such as to assist the so-called third world, through additional resources, to combat and eradicate the environmental problems of under-development, such as slum conditions, ill health, pollution, malnutrition, contamination of the environment and the gradual destruction of ecology, all of which force millions of persons to live in conditions that can only be termed subhuman.\n168.\tThe Stockholm Conference opened a door to hope. The General Assembly now has incumbent upon it the responsibility of channeling that thought expressed by the international community and thereby to strengthen the achievements of the Conference and thus make reality of the motto \\\"Only One Earth\\\" that ruled the debates among the participants.\n169.\tIn contrast with the obsolete concept of the extension of sovereign rights over the sea solely in order to ensure the defense of a nation, there arises the truly constructive and dynamic concept of co-operation as a function of the economic and social development of peoples. And thus the proclamation of the right of States to establish the limits of their sovereignty over the seas adjacent! to their coasts in accordance with their own peculiar geographical, geological and ecological characteristics and the need for the rational utilization of their resources constitutes one of the most significant steps in the formulation of the new law of the sea. At the same time it is a positive achievement on the part of the less-developed countries to obtain for their peoples, eager as they are for progress and improvement, those means which nature placed at their disposal and which, generally speaking, in the past were exploited and utilized to increase the power and wealth of maritime nations that had nothing to do with the seas in which that wealth lay.\n170.\tEcuador, in accordance with these principles and consistent with the norms of maritime policy which were agreed to in 1952 with Chile and Peru in the Santiago Declaration  exercises a sovereignty whose outer limit lies at 200 miles from the base-line, and we are happy that the principle that was voiced by the countries of the southeastern Pacific was the point of departure of a wide-scale movement that today has supporters and co-operation among nations from all continents.\n171.\tLamentable incidents which have occurred because of the stubborn illegal action and misuse by foreign fishers who follow an old practice of exploiting the wealth of others have once again shown that to guarantee and to protect the interests of the coastal States a mere declaration of preferential or exclusive rights does not suffice. The exercise of the sovereign power of the State is necessary, especially so since the sea-and with the sea I include the water, the soil and subsoil, and their renewable and non-renewable resources-constitutes a single unit that cannot be destroyed and therefore in its integral wholeness belongs to the coastal State that possesses eminent domain.\n172.\tThe life of relations among States evolves rapidly towards new concepts and new goals compatible with the progress both of law and science. To cleave to the old concepts and to try to formulate a law of the sea without departing from the obsolete classical lines would be an insurmountable barrier to the establishment of norms which are a vital need for the international community today. Unlimited respect for the norms that safeguard order, peace and the security of States and that preserve the resources necessary for the subsistence and the progress of the peoples are not incompatible with the exercise of the rights of the community as far as transit, navigation, communication and international co-operation are concerned.\n173.\tThus the rights of States generate the duties of the international community and that relationship, because of the existing interdependence, in turn imposes obligations which the State cannot avoid and which constitute its duty to the community.\n174.\tFor all these reasons, Ecuador contends that the new orientations of the law of the sea, with the extension of the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the coastal State to a limit of 200 miles, fits perfectly with the requirements of the international community and allows a just relationship between what the State proclaims for itself, with the need to preserve the maritime resources, and with what interdependence requires for a better development of international life. The Ecuadorean sea is open to international communications and, far from isolating itself from the world, is a valuable element of relationship and cooperation, although we firmly oppose any act or abuse violating the interests of the people and the essential rights of our State. This same concept governs the exercise of sovereignty over the air space above the adjacent sea to a limit of 200 miles.\n175.\tIn a spirit of frank understanding and in order to contribute to a better presentation of the new norms of the law of the sea, reaffirming the respect for the sovereign rights of States and the value of the duties flowing from interdependence, my country will participate in forthcoming regional and world conferences, since we are convinced that the results to be achieved at such conferences will be beneficial to the strengthening of peace and will ensure closer co-operation among nations and the steady and speedy progress of the less developed nations, which have in the sea the ways and means of achieving better standards of living for themselves and progress for their people.\n176.\tThe existing trade systems and the monetary and financial machinery were established after the Second World War with very little participation on the part of developing nations. These were articulations designed primarily to encourage the economic growth and recovery of the developed nations. That objective has now been achieved. After 25 years a certain number of countries have become industrially and technologically super-developed, while the majority of mankind, which had little to do in the programming of the present financial and trade system, is facing the very grave problems of under-development and is living in a way that is incompatible with the present stage of civilization or the norms of coexistence and justice set up in the last few years.\n177.\tLately, a number of developed countries have confronted grave problems flowing from their excessive accumulation of wealth and have been forced to modify the present monetary and financial system, seeking new balances and altering the fragile rules to which the developing countries were still trying to adjust themselves in their struggle for justice and social welfare. As part of that same struggle, the countries of the third world some time ago stressed the need to transform the present, unjust structures.\n178.\tWe therefore came to a moment of grave significance in the history of international economic relations. For different and varied reasons, there still is a wide consensus on the part of both developed and developing countries that reforms should be made in the present trade, financial and monetary systems. My country believes that the best way of trying to harmonize these interests is through sincere international negotiations on an equal footing and with the widest participation of all peoples of the world. We contend, further, that it is up to the different bodies and organs of the United Nations to play a basic role in this process of negotiation. We trust that at the present session of the General Assembly a decisive awareness of this matter will grow and that the world Organization will be led to carry out its full responsibilities.\n179.\tThe solutions to be found should be wide-scale. Mere palliatives will not be acceptable, still less slight paternalistic concessions on the part of the developed nations. I say this because I recall a number of proposals or formulas put forward in the case of the law of the sea in UNCTAD and when dealing with the problems of the environment.\n180.\tOn behalf of my country, I must recall that there are very important conceptual bases and principles for international co-operation, just as there are a series of hopes and proposals submitted by the developing countries, all of which must be utilized as soon as possible in the different international organs.\n181.\tOne of those principles that warrants emphasis is the need for an equitable distribution of the benefits of trade and of co-operation among all countries, and particularly the developing countries.\n182.\tThe approval at the third session of UNCTAD of special measures to benefit the least advanced of the developing nations and of the land-locked developing countries was a very just and appropriate decision, but within that very context it is necessary that the United Nations should give the same importance to problems that beset the less advanced of the developing nations of each region.\n183.\tHere again, I wish to repeat our whole-hearted support of the initiative of the President of Mexico regarding the drafting of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States, to which UNCTAD resolution 45 (III) refers. Scattered in different instruments and resolutions there are a number of principles governing international trade relations and the problems touching economic development. We believe those principles should be codified for international acceptance in a charter, similar to that which was adopted by UNCTAD in its resolution 46 (III).\n184.\tOn maritime transport a number of recommendations and decisions were adopted regarding the improvement of port facilities, the development of merchant marines by developing countries, combined international transport of merchandise and economic co-operation in marine transport. Ecuador is giving an effective impetus to the development of its merchant marine and therefore has in the last few months, in accordance with the international principles governing this question, put into force a law reserving certain freight for Ecuadorean vessels which we consider vital to the interests of the country.\n185.\tWe must stress the fact that we cannot speak of freedom when surrounded by poverty, or of justice when close to two thirds of mankind lives in subhuman conditions. Therefore, my country reads into the words \\\"freedom\\\" and \\\"equality\\\" necessarily an economic growth and social progress that will assure dignified standards of living for all peoples. It is obvious, therefore, that international action must be directed towards tearing down such obstacles through co-operation for development, with all necessary resources and, under soft and preferential conditions, so that the developing countries can set in motion their mass programs to deal with those problems. Therefore, although Ecuador gives the United Nations organs much support, from this rostrum I am happy to note that my country considers UNCTAD and the United Nations Development program to be instruments of such special importance in the fulfillment of the objectives of our Organization that they require more political support and greater resources for the future.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to start by echoing the congratulations which my colleagues have extended to you on your assumption of office as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to you and to your country.\n99.\tAs this is the first time that I have addressed the Assembly since the election of the Secretary-General, I should like to take this opportunity also to salute him. He has proved in the last nine months our wisdom in electing him and he has brought to this Organization the same dedication and the same talents he gave to his own country as diplomat and Foreign Minister.\n100.\tThere is an arresting phrase in the Preamble to the United Nations Charter. It bids us all \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\". The United Nations was born from the death and destruction of two world wars in this century in which it was proved beyond any doubt that there is no longer any gain, economic or political, to be won from aggression. Those wars started in Europe. It is not therefore surprising that we have concluded in Western Europe that there is no future for any country in trying to achieve its economic or political aims by the use of force, and we are combining to remove the past rivalries in Europe and the causes of them. It is only when that lesson, which we have painfully learned, gains universal support that we shall have fulfilled the precept of this Charter which requires us to live as good neighbors. We long ago decided that collective action was necessary to meet any potential aggressor. We organized accordingly and, although at great cost, Western Europe has enjoyed physical security. As long as there is a threat we will sustain the necessary effort.\n101.\tBut, in addition to defense, national leaders have two responsibilities which must run in harness. The first is to achieve for their people a continuing improvement in the standards of education and living and the second is to guide their country's policies so as to contribute to harmony in international society. Civilization for man can thrive only in a climate of peace.\n102.\tAt this point of history, therefore, the public experiment in partnership being conducted by the enlarged European Community is of prime importance. Western Europe, late in the day but better late than never is putting into practice for the common good a philosophy which embraces full economic and political partnership. We are doing so for two overriding reasons: to outlaw the wars which have twice brought the continent to its knees and to enhance by a customs union the prosperity of the member States. We do not intend to lose our national identities but to merge our complementary personalities for the greater good of all. These developments must be of profound significance in the context of the wider world.\n103.\tWere the Community to confine its benefits to the compass of its own membership, it would be missing its opportunity in terms of the general health of the world community. An inbred and introvert community could indeed invite trade wars and stimulate selfishness. For the United Kingdom, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, any form of narrow European isolation would be totally alien to our whole philosophy. But there is no question of any such thing. No one contemplates that in the European Community. The call for the policies of the good neighbor in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations finds an echo in the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome, where the purpose of the Community is stated thus: \\\"Desirous of contributing by means of a common commercial policy to the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade\\\" and \\\"intending to confirm the solidarity which bind Europe and overseas countries, and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations\\\".8 So the Community has explicitly shown that it is pursuing the same objectives as the United Nations, a fact of undeniable importance when it is realized-as perhaps it seldom is that the Community conducts 41 per cent of the trade of the world and that Europe's contribution will be of great importance in the discussions of, for example, international monetary reform.\n104.\tIn each of the last three years the total flow of resources from Britain multilateral and bilateral, private and public to developing countries to help them raise their standard of living has been over the target of 1 per cent of our gross national product. The existing members of the Community have already played a notable part in this international effort. But I believe that the European Community as a whole can make a much more effective contribution by co-ordinating the efforts of individual member States in a conscious, co-operative program for the development of the developing world. The deliberations of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTAD/ in 1972, in which we were glad to play a leading part, serve to remind us how complete is our interdependence. We must find more satisfactory solutions to the problems to which UNCTAD has drawn such graphic attention. Europe, too, can make a telling contribution to solving the accumulating problems of the twentieth century, which may be grouped under the heading \\\"the environment\\\". I am glad to announce that, subject to parliamentary approval, the United Kingdom will contribute up to \u00a3 2 million over a five-year period to the proposed United Nations Environment Fund, depending on the response made to the $100 million target.\n105.\tIn all these ways, the enlarged European Community will pass the test of neighborliness which is set in the preamble to the United Nations Charter, in terms both of its own membership and of its future relationship with the rest of the world.\n106.\tCan we in Western Europe extend the area of confidence and hope, a theme to which Mr. Schumann, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France, spoke yesterday [2041st meeting/ with eloquence and general acceptance? For that we shall need in Western Europe the active response of the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe when the conference on security and co-operation in Europe and negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions come to be staged.\n107.\tWe must face the facts even when they are unpleasant. Since the last World War the confrontation over the years between the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led to an almost total loss of confidence. Western Europe had no desire for this, but the fact is that neighborliness, once confidence is broken, cannot be recreated in a day.\n108.\tProgress in detente has by any standard of tolerance been painfully slow. Nevertheless, there have been modest gains. The test-ban Treaty  holds; the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have placed a limitation on anti-ballistic missiles; the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and between the Federal Republic and Poland are a contribution to stability, as the Polish Foreign Minister has himself just declared; the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin can do much for the security and well-being of the city's inhabitants. This is a notable contrast to the days when Berlin was threatened by isolation and the need for an airlift. We should mark that contrast. Negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and its East German neighbor are at last making some progress. And in this improved climate, which I think most of the speakers have marked in this debate, a European security conference may be able to identify and to exploit other areas which can be used for the common benefit both of Western Europe and of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. It will not be easy. Where social and economic systems are so different and where the gulf is so wide between the Soviet interpretation of the free life and that which is practiced in the West, it is best to try for limited objectives. But we must, if life is to be tolerable, replace the negative conception of coexistence with a fabric of trust. We willingly put our hand to that task in Western Europe and look forward to this first meeting an event in itself on a common platform of countries that are members of the Warsaw Pact Organization and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to be joined by the European neutrals. Mutual and balanced force reductions present a daunting problem because there are so many facets, military and geographical, which go to make up what is known as the balance of power in Europe, and indeed the balance of power in the world. So far it is a fact of life that it is the military balance on which the present peace rests, and that is likely to be so for some time to come. It will be our objective in all these discussions to find new approaches to neighborliness with the East, consistent with the physical security of our respective peoples.\n109.\tThe Secretary-General, in the wise introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/'8701/ Add.l], has rightly drawn attention to the important signs of detente among the great Powers, signs which include the developments which I have just described. But the Secretary-General equally rightly pointed out the contrast between these signs and the persistence of conflict in several key areas of the world and the failure, both of the Governments concerned and of the international community, to find acceptable solutions to the underlying causes of the confrontation.\n110.\tAlthough there are signs of rapprochement in Europe and indeed in Asia, there remain historic areas of continuing hostility. The danger in these places is that deadlock will be tacitly accepted as the best for which anyone can hope. That is the last doctrine which this Assembly can accept. The Secretary-General's statements and actions since he assumed office bear witness to the fact that he has no patience with the passive acceptance of deadlock. To resolve the Middle East conflict we at the United Nations made a start by framing Security Council resolution 242 (1967). My Government continues to adhere firmly to that, resolution. It will be commonly conceded, I think, by all my colleagues who are here, that we will not arrive at any alternative framework which would command a comparable measure of consent. It is better, therefore, to stick to it. This resolution provides the essential basis of any just and durable settlement primarily because it acknowledges the essential requirements of the parties, first for withdrawal, and secondly for security.\n111.\tMy Government has consistently supported the mission of Mr. Jarring, the Secretary-General's Special Representative appointed under the resolution. I very much hope that in the months ahead no opportunity will be missed to work towards an end of the present confrontation with the long-drawn-out misery of the refugees which it entails, and also the ever-present threat of war.\n112.\tIn the last few months there has been a dramatic change. Egypt has dispensed with Soviet military support. It should be recognized that this step towards depolarization is an opportunity to resume the quest for a peaceful settlement. It may be fleeting, so it should be seized. Nor should we be deflected, from this aim by the cycle of violence and reprisal which has been given fresh impetus in recent weeks.\n113.\tMr. Rogers, Secretary of State of the United States, drew our attention on Monday [2038th meeting] to many instances of the world-wide problem of terrorism and violence. This is a disease to which many of us in this Assembly have fallen victim. We have our own special problem of indiscriminate terrorism in Northern Ireland. In 1971 in this Assembly I drew urgent attention to our responsibilities for the climate in which the terrorist operated his beastly practice. I said: \\\"Sooner or later, uncompromising confrontation leads to violence [1944th meeting, para. 86.] I also said, \\\". .. time works for the anarchist\\\". [Ibid.] I then drew the attention of this Assembly of nations to the situation which seemed certain to develop, and here you will forgive me if I quote once more: \\\"... anarchy superseding the law of nations and with it the inherent challenge to all governmental authority.\\\" [Ibid., para. 87.] This is exactly what is happening now. I continued with a quotation from my statement at the 1838th meeting: '\\\"We must call on those who have taken up arms to lay them down ... even though they claim to be carrying them in the name of justice.' \\\" [Ibid.]\n114.\tNow we are up against many situations in which terrorists are meting out destruction to the innocent in the name of some hideously distorted interpretation of justice. We have wasted time in these last two or three years. Terrorism must be stopped so that law and order in the world society will not be totally undermined-and we all know this in this Assembly.\n115.\tThe Secretary-General was right to recommend this subject for inclusion in our agenda [A/8791 and Add.l], and I am glad that the Assembly has so included it [item 92]. This question must be vigorously pursued. We in Britain will support drastic measures to stop this rot, and we welcome the initiative of Mr. Rogers! I think we must recognize that the essence of the success of any action lies in the collective application of the remedies. It is only through the international community that effective measures can be taken to end the hideous cycle of terror and violence. That is the lesson all of us in this Assembly have to accept and to apply.\n116.\tThere are certain practical steps we can all take. First, on the question of hijacking, States which have not yet become parties to the Conventions of The Hague  and Montreal  should move with all possible speed to do so. We should also do all we can to bring into effect further measures to close every haven to the hijacker and the saboteur. The United Kingdom, at the recent meeting of the Legal Committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization, has worked actively to that end. Secondly, there are three main areas in which we should make urgent progress in dealing with the problem of international terrorism. We must agree on further obligations which States should assume in regard to the prosecution and surrender of perpetrators of terrorist acts. We should decide on further controls which could be imposed to prevent the movement of terrorists from one country to another. We should do everything possible to increase co-operation among national police and security forces by encouraging the exchange of information and by taking other measures to prevent these acts and to apprehend their perpetrators. These and other measures should be considered without delay, but I repeat that action, to be effective, must be collective. We shall make our full contribution in the discussion that has already begun at this session of the General Assembly.\n117.\tThe good-neighborliness to which we are summoned by the Preamble to our Charter applies to\\\" us all without exception. It is not limited by geography or race. The Ugandan Government's action in expelling Ugandan Asians and confiscating their assets, without clear and unequivocal assurances of full and prompt compensation, illustrates the degradation to which intolerance can bring its disciples. This is an outrage against standards of human decency, in the face of which this Assembly cannot remain silent. These Asians have had their homes in Uganda, some of them for generations. They are now being ejected and stripped of most of their belongings and of their savings accumulated over many years. My Government, in spite of the fact that Britain is a small, overcrowded island, had made arrangements whereby Asians from East Africa holding British passports were coming into Britain in an orderly flow over the years. As far as Uganda is concerned, this agreed program has been thrown out of the window, and the Asians have been given a time limit of 90 days in which to leave. There are now only 42 days left. President Amin has said that if the Asians have not left before that deadline he will put them into \\\"camps\\\". We do not accept that that deadline has any justification in law or in morality. The Government of Uganda is responsible for the proper treatment of those who have lived in that country for many years, and putting them into \\\"camps\\\" is contrary to all accepted standards of civilized behavior. We have an obligation to take into Britain those who are British nationals and have nowhere else to go. We will keep our word, and we will keep the law. But the law is not everything. There are human problems, rights and feelings which should have equal consideration. The Ugandan Government should be called upon to change its policy and treat these people with humanity and not with contempt. Injustice must be condemned wherever it rears its ugly head, whether it is perpetrated by Europeans or Africans or Asians or whoever. Every country in the Assembly, therefore, should use its influence to insist that this injustice should end.\n118.\tI am making two direct and simple requests to you as members of the world community assembled here. The first is to show your good-neighborliness by sharing some of the practical problems of resettling these unhappy people. I am exceedingly grateful and pay a tribute to all those who have come forward with offers of help. The second is that you should all join in calling upon General Amin to extend his arbitrary and inhumane deadline of 90 days and to allow the Asians expelled to take their belongings with them. These are two simple, humane concepts. My delegation will today request that this question should be added to our agenda as an urgent and important item.  We ask that the Assembly debate this matter without delay and we are ready to submit a draft resolution-for this inhumanity which creates refugees is of international concern. I trust that it will be overwhelmingly accepted, because, should this Organization fail to do so, there is no one to whom any person, whatever the color of his skin, can turn for common justice. This is the basis of my appeal to all of you today.\n119.\tIn conclusion, therefore, I believe that when we speak or write we should constantly remind ourselves of those words in the Preamble to this Charter: \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\". Our minds admit the sense of this precept, but our acts fall far short of it. We must be vigilant and careful for our fellow men and act with urgency if we are to gain that peace with justice which all our people so intensely and insistently demand.\n"

        "file_text": "Comrade President, in making my first speech from this rostrum, I should like first of all, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and on my own behalf, to extend cordial congratulations to you on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you success in carrying out your noble task, and I am certain that under your guidance the present session of the General Assembly will take new, concrete steps towards the affirmation and practical attainment of peaceful, constructive relations between peoples a goal towards which Poland has made its contribution together with the other socialist countries.\n84.\tI should also like to welcome the Secretary-General, Kurt Waldheim, and to take this opportunity at the opening\tat the twenty-seventh session, the first session since his\tI election to that high post, to wish him success in his demanding work.\n85.\tAt a time when the most authoritative representatives of States Members of the United Nations have an opportunity to speak from this rostrum and to set out the position of their Governments on the principal problems of the present day, we should like to state that we join a number of previous speakers in noting with satisfaction that the process of detente is one of the most significant and encouraging factors of the present moment in history. For that reason, we associate ourselves with all those who laid stress on the favorable trends in international life that have appeared since the end of the twenty-sixth session.\n86.\tIndeed, we have witnessed events which only a year I ago appeared far off and improbable. Exceptionally important agreements came into force within a brief period during the current year, summit meetings were held between the leaders of great Powers, and historic treaties were signed. Of course, these events cannot be regarded as s accidental or coincidental. We are deeply convinced and I should like to stress this-that what is involved is a natural development, the result of the growth of the forces of peace and their unyielding struggle for detente and the strengthening of peace and international security.\n87.\tIn noting the importance of the favorable developments which have occurred during the year, one cannot but\tI stress their link with the consistent and active foreign\tpolicies of the socialist countries, particularly the Soviet Union, which has for 50 years been pursuing an unwavering\t policy of peace, mutual understanding and co-operation. It was because of that policy that such useful steps were taken as the coming into force of the treaty of 12 August 1970 between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and the Treaty of 7 December 1970 between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany, the Quadripartite Agreement, of 3 September 1971, on West Berlin and the agreements concluded on 8 December 1971 by the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany and with the West Berlin Senate. This put an end to an extremely serious problem which had been troubling\ninternational relations in Europe for many years.\n88.\tThere can no doubt that the talks held in Moscow, the Basic Principles of Mutual Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States signed in the Soviet capital on 29 May 1972  and the concrete agreements reached in the field of strategic arms control  are also beneficial to the cause of strengthening peace. \n89.\tAnother encouraging factor has been the contacts initiated in a key area of the Far East, where the possibility has arisen of achieving direct mutual understanding between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea. An important agreement on bilateral relations has been reached between India and Pakistan, and this is a step forward towards the establishment of a lasting peace on the Hindustan peninsula.\n90.\tAll these events bear witness to an increasingly pronounced trend in international life towards the establishment of new relationships between States and an improved outlook for the peaceful settlement of longstanding disputes, without the use or the threat of force. There are thus encouraging prospects for new efforts to achieve a further detente, to prevent a revival of the cold war, to eliminate existing hotbeds of conflicts and to strengthen international security and peace throughout the world.\n91.\tIn this positive process, great importance naturally attaches to the question of convening a European conference on security and co-operation, which would be an extremely significant contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and international security. I believe that today no one can deny that the socialist countries' initiative evoked a wide and favorable public response not only in Europe but throughout the world. This initiative revitalized the political activities of European States, produced numerous contacts and useful exchanges of views between statesmen, and facilitated and accelerated the development of various types of closer co-operation in all spheres of public life.\n92.\tThere is no question that the achievements of this year have established the necessary objective preconditions for the convening of the conference, which is now an urgent matter facing the peoples of Europe. It is essential to take advantage of the favorable political climate prevailing on the ancient continent in order to hasten and strengthen this process of clearing the air.\n93.\tIn addition to the need to convene a European conference on security and co-operation, there are pressing issues like the normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, including recognition that the Munich Agreement was invalid ab initio, and the admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations. There is no question that the settlement of these issues would give new and powerful impetus to an even more rapid improvement of the political climate on the continent and throughout the world.\n94.\tThe admission of the two German States to the United Nations is undeniably one of the most urgent steps that could be taken to strengthen security in Europe, and it would be in the interests of all European States and the entire world community. This would be a significant contribution to the cause of strengthening the United Nations itself by reinforcing one of the basic principles of the Charter, the principle of universality.\n95.\tThe argument that a settlement of this question is dependent on the establishment of normal bilateral relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany does not stand up under examination. It runs counter to the logic of present developments in Europe. The immediate admission of the two German States to the United Nations would provide a decisive stimulus to the establishment of a climate of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborliness between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and would contribute to a solution of the problems which are impeding the establishment of normal relations between them.\n96.\tAs a representative of a socialist country whose foreign policy has at all times been inspired by the principles of peaceful coexistence, I should like to deal specifically with the favorable development of the situation in the Balkans. For almost three decades, the Bulgarian Government has been making every effort to support, develop and strengthen friendly and good-neighborly ties with the Balkan countries and to contribute to an improvement in the political climate in that area. I should like to express my satisfaction at the fact that our country's efforts are appreciated and welcomed by other Balkan States. The favorable signs and tendencies pointing towards mutual understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation between the States of the Balkan peninsula are becoming a permanent, encouraging trend which all Balkan peoples have an interest in furthering.\n97.\tIn its attitude towards the favorable results of the visits, meetings and contacts which have taken place between high-ranking representatives of the Balkan countries and which have provided opportunities for the discussion of problems of mutual interest as the President of the State Council, Todor Zhivkov, has emphasized several times the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to be inspired by the same unchangeable principles and will, as before, be ready at all times to follow this path, to contribute actively to a further affirmation and strengthening of the spirit of mutual understanding and trust in the Balkans.\n98.\tHowever, I cannot but express here my concern at the attempts of certain circles in the West to provoke and promote tension in areas in close proximity to the Balkan peninsula. Their purpose is to disturb the tranquil atmosphere which the peoples of the Balkans are so anxious to maintain and improve.\n99.\tThe main problem and, if I may be permitted to say so, the object of universal concern in the thoughts and feelings of peoples is the question of strengthening international security and maintaining peace. There is no need to point out how real and justified are people's fears of a new international conflagration and its disastrous consequences. It is an elementary truth that only in conditions of lasting peace and security can the extremely complex problems facing mankind be solved.\n100.\tThat is why the international community gives priority to questions connected with the strengthening of peace and security. It is also the reason for its sensitivity to anything that directly or indirectly relates to security. Clear proof of this can be seen in decisions adopted at the last two sessions of the General Assembly the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] and the resolution concerning its implementation [resolution 2880 (XXVI)].\n101.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is profoundly convinced that the problems of international security are of central importance in the work of the present session. The United Nations, which was created in order to watch tirelessly over world peace, does not and cannot have any greater task than that. The States Members of this Organization must and given a spirit of goodwill- can breathe life into these extremely important documents.\n102.\tThe twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is called upon to make a valuable contribution to the effort to strengthen international security and prevent military conflicts by making progress, in particular, towards solving the most important problem of all that of the non-use of force and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. The new Soviet proposal on the \\\"non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [A/L.676] is therefore a timely and extremely important initiative. In calling upon all States to renounce the use of force by any means of warfare, the Soviet Government is affirming one of the most important and fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, renunciation of the use of force is inseparably bound up with the permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons, the most powerful means of mass destruction.\n103.\tThe draft resolution submitted by the Soviet delegation is a concrete and timely step towards the practical implementation of this proposal. The Bulgarian delegation firmly and whole-heartedly supports it and believes that its consideration and adoption by the General Assembly would open the way to giving its provisions binding force in accordance with Article 25 of the United Nations Charter and would promote the further strengthening of international security.\n104.\tAt the same time, this should not be construed as an infringement of the right of any nation to Individual or collective self-defense or as a renunciation of the use of force against aggression in the struggle of oppressed peoples for national independence or self-determination. Moreover, a positive solution of this problem would give new impetus to the recent trend towards reducing international tension and limiting the arms race.\n105.\tThe logic of international developments creates a direct, indissoluble link between the problems of disarmament and the entire complex of problems relating to security.\n106.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has always supported and continues to support all useful initiatives in the field of disarmament. By taking part in the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament meeting at Geneva, it is making its contribution to the adoption of a number of concrete decisions and draft treaties and conventions. From our own experience, we know well the difficulties and obstacles which stand in the way of such decisions. For that reason, we cannot agree with those who under-estimate the agreements that have already been achieved. The Bulgarian delegation takes the view that new impetus should be given to the disarmament negotiations and that it is essential to take advantage of every opportunity to join efforts in promoting the widest possible international discussion of this crucial question.\n107.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the broad program for disarmament negotiations proposed by the Government of the Soviet Union in April 1971 as well as the Soviet proposal at the twenty-sixth session for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference [A/8491] at which this question so vitally important for mankind-would for the first time receive the most thorough consideration in all its aspects with a view to achieving the great ultimate goal: general and complete disarmament under strict international control. In its reply to the Secretary-General's letter on this [see A/8817, annex], the Bulgarian Government urges the immediate establishment of an appropriate preparatory organ for the World Disarmament Conference so that the Conference will be convened in the near future-in 1973, or at all events not later than 1974.\n108.\tAs we are all aware, events have occurred in recent months which bespeak a desire to improve the international situation in other parts of the world. I refer to new developments on the Korean peninsula, which are reflected in the joint communique issued by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea on 4 july 1972 [A/8727, annex I]. This positive development shows that the socialist countries are correct and justified in the urgent demand they have made in the United Nations General Assembly by the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and the withdrawal of United States troops from the peninsula in order to enable the people of Korea to solve their problems themselves [A/8752/Add.9]. It also shows that the resolutions adopted in the past on the question of Korea do not reflect the desires of the people of Korea and are a major obstacle to the establishment of contacts between the two parts of the country. Today, the real issue is that of eliminating outside interference. The United Nations should assist the people of Korea in realizing its clearly expressed desire to decide its own fate. One can only deplore the fact that, through the efforts of those same forces which for many years have been obstructing the peaceful unification of Korea, consideration of the question of removing the principal obstacles to the reunification of the country has once again been deferred this year.\n109.\tThe agreement on bilateral relations signed by India and Pakistan is an important step towards establishing normal relations and laying the foundations for a lasting peace and good-neighborliness on the Hindustan peninsula. This sound policy being pursued by two major Asian States is a significant contribution to the task of improving the political climate in southern Asia.\n110.\tThe admission of Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations would further help to promote the process of establishing a genuinely peaceful atmosphere in that part of the world and would also be an affirmation of the principle of United Nations universality. Like any sovereign State, Bangladesh meets all the requirements for membership in the world organization, and no one has any basis for disputing its right to become a Member. The delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is convinced that the United Nations General Assembly will take the only correct decision and support Bangladesh's request for admission to the United Nations [A/8754].\n111.\tBeing concerned about the maintenance of peace and bearing responsibility for it, States Members of the Organization cannot and do not have the right to remain silent about the most acute and most urgent crises and conflicts of our time.\n112.\tThe war in Viet-Nam is continuing, with use being made of everything that modern military technology has to offer. The annihilation of the peaceful, defenseless population is arousing righteous indignation and outrage throughout the world. The interventionists are attempting to do what is clearly impossible to destroy the will and the unparalleled courage of the heroic people of Viet-Nam.\n113.\tThe Bulgarian people, who have always maintained solidarity with the just struggle of Viet-Nam and the other peoples of IndoChina, support the demand for the unconditional cessation of the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the blockade of its ports, as well as the demand for the withdrawal of all United States armed forces from that area in order to permit the peoples of IndoChina to determine their own fate. After 10 years of military operations, it has become quite clear that the war will be ended not through escalation but only through negotiations on the basis of the proposals put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam.\n114.\tAnother constant source of alarm and anxiety in the world is the situation in the Middle East. As events of the last few weeks have shown, a storm can blow up there at any time, producing a dangerous crisis with unforeseeable consequences. The United Nations has been involved in the search for a just and peaceful solution of the problem, and the anxiety with which the matter has been viewed here over a period of many years is justified. A huge majority of States Members of the United Nations are rightly insisting that Israel should accept full responsibility for the increasing tension which now exists. By their refusal to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and their entire policy of expansion, aggression and disregard for the rules of international law, the Israeli leaders are frustrating the efforts of this international organization, undermining its authority and sabotaging the mission of the Secretary-General's representative, Ambassador jarring.\n115.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria has always insisted that Israel should desist from its dangerous policy of provocation in this highly tense area and that, in order to facilitate Ambassador Jarring's task, Israel should finally begin to implement Security Council resolution 242(1967). We believe that the present General Assembly session will once again demonstrate to Israel that it cannot expect to obtain, and will not obtain, foreign territory as a reward for committing aggression and flouting the Charter and the authority of the United Nations.\n116.\tWe unreservedly support the efforts of the Arab States to eliminate the consequences of Israeli aggression and the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for the restoration of their rights. At the same time, we repudiate the terrorist acts committed by certain elements in the resistance movement. Such desperate and reckless acts as the incident in Munich harm chiefly the cause of the Palestinian people and are used by Israel in the interests of its aggressive Zionist policies.\n117.\tA number of important questions are on the agenda of the current session. My delegation regards all of them as very significant and will set forth its position in the appropriate Committees. However, I should like to state from this rostrum that we oppose today, as we have in the past, all attempts of any kind to revise the United Nations Charter. I wish to emphasize again that the reason for the shortcomings of this international Organization should be sought not in the Organization itself but in the policies of those countries which, now as in the past, are not observing the United Nations Charter and are violating its fundamental principles.\n118.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches great importance to the question of preparing a convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting. This question has immediate relevance and deserves to be considered in a properly serious and careful manner.\n119.\tThe United Nations is also confronted with the task of resolving a number of important questions relating to economic co-operation, including the problem of accelerating the economic development of the recently liberated peoples.\n120.\tWe believe that in the struggle for a new and just international division of labor which will take account of the interests of all States and ensure favorable conditions for rapid economic development, the United Nations should play an important role and take a firm position on the side of the developing countries.\n121.\tWe are profoundly convinced that the United Nations is also .called upon to play a historic role in carrying out the program of action for the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], including, first and foremost, its application to the peoples of Guinea (Bissau), Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia in their struggle for the final elimination of the criminal policy of apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination.\n122.\tThe position of the People's Republic of Bulgaria on all these questions has been set forth on more than one occasion in the appropriate organs of the United Nations and is well known.\n123.\tIn concluding my statement, I should like to express my delegation's conviction that the current session, in giving serious and thorough consideration to the items on the agenda, will take into account the important present stage in the development of international relations and will give new impetus to the trend towards acceleration of the process of detente and the strengthening of international security. In doing so, the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly will help to ensure that the positive factors in contemporary political life tip the scales of history and that mankind advances even closer to the realization of its great objective: the establishment of lasting peace and security throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "General debates have traditionally been occasions for stock-taking, for reflecting upon the state of the world and of the United Nations, and for giving voice at this universal forum to the needs and aspirations of mankind. As we approach the end of this particular general debate, we find the balance sheet a sobering blend of hope and concern.\n153.\tThe two super-Powers have taken an important step to control the nuclear armaments race by agreeing to quantitative limits on strategic nuclear weapons. Yet their competition for qualitative supremacy in nuclear weaponry continues, precluding substantial reductions in their armament budgets. And while expectations of progress towards disarmament are prominently projected, there is a significant silence on the use of the immense savings that would accrue from disarmament.\n154.\tThe great hope of the poor countries, repeatedly expressed in this Assembly over the years, that a substantial part of savings from disarmament should be committed to development aid thus remains a remote, if not indeed an illusory, hope. The link which the developing countries have sought to establish between the two major undertakings of the United Nations in the 1970s the Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade  remains tenuous at best.\n155.\tThe welcome detente in Europe has undoubtedly reduced international tensions on that continent, one which has the dubious distinction of having produced two world wars and still has the potential to ignite a third one in this century. Yet nuclear proliferation continues in Europe, and one of Europe's leading countries has persisted in conducting nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean in disregard of the United Nations ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere and under water and in defiance of world public opinion and the indignant protests of the countries in the area, which rightly argue that, if such nuclear tests are as harmless as they are claimed to be, there is no reason not to conduct them in the Atlantic Ocean, or for that matter, off the famous Riviera, where they might serve as an additional tourist attraction.\n156.\tNext door, in the Middle East, not only has peace remained out of reach but the jockeying among the great Powers for positions of advantage and influence in the continuing crisis has not abated. Nor have the sales and supplies of arms to the combatant countries been stopped. This is a factor worth pondering in connexion with the proposal, laudable in its avowed purpose, for the non-use of force in international disputes. Does this proposal simply mean that the great Powers should refrain from attacking one another directly? Should it not, rather, be carried a step further and taken to mean that the great Powers should not abet the use of force by lesser Powers through the convenient device of selling or supplying arms to them? In other words, is it not about time that the great Powers, unable to attack one another directly without mortal danger to themselves, ceased to practice wars by proxy, by using the third world as a cockpit for their persisting ambitions for regional or global hegemony?\n157.\tWe have noted the developing detente in Europe, but what of other regions peace being all the more indivisible now in our ever more tightly interdependent world?\n158.\tLatin America is in the throes of a social revolution which is unfolding within the framework of its deeply ingrained sense of solidarity, its cherished traditions of justice and responsible order and its strong desire to make its full contribution to international peace and well-being.\n159.\tAfrica continues its uncompromising struggle against apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination, hand in hand with its struggle, no less uncompromising, against the remaining strongholds of colonialism. These are struggles to which the Philippines, with its own experience of nearly four centuries of colonialism and of exploitation by foreign Powers, cannot remain indifferent; indeed we have time and again manifested our solidarity with our African friends on these fundamental issues, which touch the very heart of the United Nations Charter.\n160.\tWhat of our own region of Asia? In Asia, too, signs of detente have been detected. An auspicious beginning has been made towards a peace settlement between India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has been recognized as an independent nation by many countries, although, regrettably, it has not yet been admitted into the United Nations. South Korea and North Korea are embarked on a fateful dialog that could conceivably lead to the agreed and peaceful reunification ardently desired by the Korean people. China and Japan have reached agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations, a step of far-reaching significance. But the tragic war in Indochina continues, with no just end as yet clearly in sight. Great Power moves to fill expected vacuums of power in the Asian region persist. There is no assurance that Asia can soon achieve the conditions of peace and stability which it so sorely needs and which found poignant expression last year in the Declaration issued at Kuala Lumpur by the Foreign Ministers of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - that their countries were \\\"determined to exert initially necessary efforts to secure the recognition of and respect for South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers\\\".\n161.\tIn the last several years the Philippines has increasingly emphasized its participation in regional groups organized in accordance with the Charter, most notably in the sphere of economic, social and cultural co-operation. There have been significant shifts in orientation in the two most important regional groupings of which we are a member. In the Asian and Pacific Council there is fresh emphasis on economic development, brought about by new developments in Asia, principally by the developing detente and the consequent realignment of forces in the area. In ASEAN, more decisive initiatives are being undertaken to promote closer regional collaboration. Early this year ASEAN took a giant step forward in its co-operative endeavors. It approved a plan for the liberalization of trade on a selective basis and another plan for industrial complementation on a similar selective basis.\n162.\tHeretofore ASEAN had been a collection of separate co-operative endeavors. Although these areas of cooperation were and are important in themselves and have proved a great practical benefit to the region in such diverse fields as the development of tourism, the utilization of available technology and cultural exchanges, the economic agreement recently concluded is bound to be regarded as the hub of ASEAN activities. It is perhaps sanguine to speak of a common market in connexion with South-East Asia at this point in time, but the complementation plan drafted with the help of the United Nations may correctly be viewed as the fore-runner of an important scheme for regional economic integration. If it succeeds, it will doubtless become a landmark in Asian economic cooperation and it will have its particular contribution to make to the world economic situation.\n163.\tThe five member countries rely on ASEAN and will do so in the future to a degree which none of them had anticipated. Unless the international economic situation improves markedly for the developing countries, the members of ASEAN will feel increasingly that the maximum opportunities for co-operation with the rest of the world could best be achieved through regional rather than individual national efforts. Looking towards this possibility, ASEAN has begun exploratory conversations with the European Economic Community with the objective of improving the deteriorating market for its export commodities.\n164.\tThus, ASEAN is proof that the habit of co-operation can be fruitfully developed, even among countries with diverse traditional backgrounds. Less than six years after its founding, ASEAN is beginning to develop a personality of its own and to exert a modest force in Asian affairs. A few years ago the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN countries agreed to try to help in mediating the Cambodian conflict. This year the same Foreign Ministers, in a move expressive of their deep concern over the war in Viet-Nam, proposed a formula which the parties to the conflict could consider as a means of breaking the impasse in current negotiations. We shall do so again, taking into account the objections voiced by the parties principally concerned, in the belief that the Asian voice is not irrelevant in a war being fought on Asian soil which causes a grievous toll in Asian lives.\n165.\tThe modest achievements of ASEAN are a source of pride to its member countries, which regard them as reassuring auguries of more important future accomplishments; ASEAN's progress could be enhanced and accelerated in the hoped-for climate of peace and stability for Asia to which I have referred.\n166.\tModest innovations recently undertaken by the United Nations have, in the view of my Government, been worth while. We are referring specifically to the reinstitution of periodic meetings of the Security Council and to the meetings of the Council held in Africa. Occasional such meetings in various parts of the globe can help to highlight and bring new efforts to bear on the problems of the region. In this connexion, the Philippine Government suggests that the Security Council should give consideration to a meeting in the near future in Asia. Asia is in a state of flux and change, and yet at the very time when there is so much new promise in Asian affairs the region remains beset by enormous problems. The effort to come to grips with both the difficulties and the new opportunities could be raised to a new level, where new perspectives could be brought to bear, in our view, by a meeting of the Security Council in Asia.\n167.\tPeace and non-interference by outside Powers these are two of the things beyond price which the developing countries of Asia need today: peace, because in the absence of the danger of aggression we can devote more of our resources to the pressing task of development to fulfill our peoples just desire for a better life; non-interference by outside Powers, because externally inspired and supported subversion is still one of the most serious problems confronting the developing countries in Asia.\n168.\tIn the Philippines this particular problem reached a state of extreme gravity last month and impelled President Marcos to invoke the authority vested in him by the Philippine Constitution to proclaim martial law. The President's immediate purpose was to safeguard the Republic of the Philippines from violent overthrow by subversive groups operating with external support. But he has also seized the opportunity to set in train urgently needed measures to eliminate the inequities in Philippine society by means of a thorough reform and restructuring of social, political and economic institutions that had not been sufficiently responsive to the urgent need for social justice. Significantly, one of the very first decisions was to declare the entire Philippines a land-reform area.\n169.\tThe seriousness of the Philippine situation was aggravated by the occurrence last July of the worst flood disaster in Philippine history. Over an area in which the average rainfall was 100 inches, 75 inches of rain fell in one single week, and the rainfall lasted for three weeks, flooding almost the entire vast fertile central plain of Luzon, which is known as the \\\"rice bowl\\\" or \\\"rice granary\\\" of the Philippines. Highly productive rice farms, sugar land, fish ponds, houses, infrastructures and industrial complexes- even the metes and bounds of private property were obliterated or damaged to an extent which may set back our development efforts for three to five years. The flood victims numbered more than 2 million persons out of the disaster area's total population of 7 million; but statistical figures alone cannot really measure the immensity of the human cost of the calamity.\n170.\tIt was in the wake of the widespread material devastation and human suffering caused by that unprecedented flood disaster that the subversive groups in the\nPhilippines intensified their attempts to sow panic and undermine the conditions of law and order indispensable to effective reconstruction work, leaving President Marcos no alternative but to declare martial law.\n171.\tAt this point, I should like to place on record the profound gratitude of the Government and people of the Philippines for the assistance given to the flood disaster victims which we received from all quarters and not only from Governments with which we have diplomatic relations, but also from countries with which we have not as yet established such relations, such as the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, both of which gave us generous and welcome assistance.\n172.\tThe International Red Cross and its affiliates, true to an old and honored tradition, responded immediately with emergency aid. So did the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEFJ with its ready supplies, its action-oriented approach, and its wealth of experience in coping with emergency situations. The World Food Program, the Economic and Social Council, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] also rose admirably to the occasion, and the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, Ambassador Farouk Berkol, faced with his first major challenge, acquitted himself in commendable fashion and vindicated the wisdom of the Assembly in establishing his Office last year. The Secretariat staff and many individual contributors, in a spontaneous gesture of sympathy, collected a substantial contribution, which the Secretary-General himself transmitted to the Philippine National Red Cross through the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.\n173.\tI have referred in some detail to the various United Nations agencies that extended assistance to the Philippines in its hour of need, because it illustrates the great constructive potential of the United Nations in assisting countries to cope with natural disasters. The Philippine delegation hopes to enhance this potential with a new proposal, following up the initiative it took at the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly on the role of the World Meteorological Organization [WMOJ in \\\"discovering ways and means to mitigate the harmful effects of... storms and remove or minimize their destructive potentials\\\". Our new proposal will take the form of a draft resolution entitled \\\"International action on the mitigation of the harmful effects of storms\\\". Its principal aim will be to bring about integrated action through increased cooperation and co-ordination among the WMO, the UNDP and the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator in the field of United Nations natural disaster assistance, particularly the prevention, prediction and control of natural disasters.\n174.\tWe hope that this Philippine proposal will attract a good number of other sponsors and that it will merit the unanimous approval of this Assembly.\n175.\tTerrorism is on our agenda [item 92], and rightly so. Criminal acts of individuals or groups of individuals against the innocent can never be condoned by the international society, and every possible resource must be mobilized to end and prevent them. Thus, it will be remembered, the\nPhilippine delegation last year exerted itself particularly in the effort to develop effective means to end the hijacking of aircraft, and the Republic of the Philippines is at present taking extraordinary measures to meet similar threats at home. To the extent that acts of terrorism are irrational and aberrant reactions to resolved international differences, they should now be excused, and must be condemned. But we must at the same time accept the responsibility of renewing our efforts to solve these disputes. We cannot claim to be blameless until we have exerted ourselves to the utmost to solve these disputes.\n176.\tThe United Nations, of course, has an immense potential for constructive work in every field of international activity, and it is one of the most lamentable facts of our time that this potential has never been fully used. The great Powers have never given to the United Nations the full measure of faith and support which it needs and deserves in order to attain the great goals of the Charter. During this general debate this Assembly hall has resounded again and again with commendatory references to vital prospects of detente, historic summit meetings, bold initiatives to inaugurate an era of negotiation in lieu of confrontation, and actual agreements on nuclear weapons control. And all of these, sad to admit, have come to pass outside the United Nations auspices. When it should be playing a central role in the efforts to achieve one of the primary aims of the Charter, the United Nations has been shunted off to to the periphery of major developments in the field of international security.\n177.\tA great opportunity was missed in the first year of the United Nations, when the great Powers failed to unite in support of the Charter's aims \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" and \\\"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained\\\". They indulged, instead, in the dangerous and sterile cold war.\n178.\tWhat a vastly different world we would now have if the great Powers had channeled even a modest portion of the immense resources which they expended on the cold war to the United Nations in order to achieve the Charter's aim \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\", thereby giving substance to the other primary aim of the Charter: \\\"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\\".\n179.\tIs it still possible for the United Nations to have a second chance to fulfill its function of effectively helping to achieve the goals of the Charter? The latest report of the President of the World Bank Group, Mr. Robert McNamara, suggests that it is almost too late. In his address to the recently concluded meeting of the World Bank Group he said and members of this Assembly should listen carefully to his words:\n\\\"With the [Official Development Assistance] only half achieved, the poorer nations have almost no hope of attaining the 6 per cent growth target. That will condemn them to so slow an economic advance over the decade that hundreds of millions of individuals within these countries will be able to detect virtually no improvement whatever in their desperately low standards of living. Their per capita incomes will rise by no more than two dollars a year.\\\"\nThose are the words of Mr. McNamara. I quote him again:\n\\\"Projected to the end of the century only a generation away that means the people of the developed counties will be enjoying per capita incomes, in 1972 prices, of over $8,000 a year, while these masses of the poor... will on average receive less than $200 per capita, and some 800 million will receive less than $100.\\\"\nIn other words, the infamous poverty gap is widening at an accelerated rate and the poor, developing countries are in fact on the verge of living in a global ghetto, with all the ominous implications of such a situation, one of which the President of the World Bank spells out in these fateful words:\n\\\"If the rich nations do not act-through both aid and trade to diminish the widening imbalance between their own collective wealth and the aggregate poverty of the poor nations, development simply cannot succeed within any acceptable time frame. The community of nations will only become more dangerously fragmented into the privileged and the deprived, the self-satisfied and the frustrated, the complacent and the bitter. It will not be an international atmosphere conducive to tranquility.\\\"\nAnd Mr. McNamara emphasizes: \\\"The developed nations, then, must do more to promote at least minimal equity in the distribution of wealth among nations.\\\"\n180.\tIn this context the decline in international cooperation for development has ominous implications not only for the prosperity but also for the prospects of a stable and enduring peace in the world. The decrease, actual and proposed, in the budgetary support of some countries for the United Nations and its family of agencies is discouraging enough. But even more disheartening is the prospect that voluntary contributions of some affluent countries to such vital United Nations agencies as UNICEF and the UNDP may either stagnate or also be reduced.\n181.\tAs one of the \\\"founding fathers\\\" of the United Nations, I sincerely hope that these apprehensions will prove to be groundless. All the great new issues developing in the United Nations underline the undeniable oneness of the human family, the inseparable unity of mankind's destiny on this fragile, finite and vulnerable planet earth.\n182.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, which achieved great success despite the formidable difficulties it had to overcome, brought home the sobering fact that we have only one earth and that we must act as one community to safeguard and nourish its life-support systems.\n183.\tThe declaration by the Secretary-General on 20 September 1972 that 1974 will be observed as World Population Year is a cogent reminder that the earth's resources are limited and that population planning is indispensable to the preservation of the human species and the enhancement of the quality of life in the world. The Philippine delegation is gratified at the outstanding success of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities in effectively conveying this message and is prepared to give its full support to the World Population Year's program.\n184.\tThe preparatory meetings for the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea pointedly remind us that sea and ocean resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are part of the common heritage of mankind.\n185.\tThe imperatives of preserving human life and enhancing its quality in a relatively small, crowded earth with finite resources are pushing us inexorably to consider seriously the necessity of subordinating narrow nationalistic self-interest to the larger requirements of mankind. The United Nations is an indispensable instrument in this inherently difficult, perhaps slow, and certainly painful, transition.\n186.\tThe United Nations is here; it is ready and eager to serve; and it is at our disposal. Let us give it a second chance to play the central role in international affairs that the Charter intended for it. As we have repeatedly proposed, let us amend the Charter, if risible, in order to make the United Nations more effective and more responsive to the needs and the problems of today. It is axiomatic that the General Assembly provides the opportunity only for the most general assessment. The kind of deliberate consideration required to a change in the Charter can only take place in a proper body constituted for that purpose. The Government of the Philippines is ready to join in recommending that a proper forum be established by the Assembly for a careful consideration of those specific suggestions which have been made or will be made in more detail by Member Governments and qualified experts. A small but broadly representative body would sift in orderly fashion the various suggestions put forward and develop a picture of the range of agreement which exists. Those suggestions commanding broad support would be acted upon in due time for two major deliberative organs of the United Nations.\n187.\tSupport for a considered examination of the world Organization's Charter and an evaluation of its effectiveness in meeting the new challenges of today has come from widely diverse quarters from Member States large and small. There is a wide-spread commitment to examine with care whatever specific proposals may be advanced. This is true, for instance, of the reply of the United States [ A[8746/Add. 1], a major founding Member, and also true of the vigorous statement made here in this Assembly by the People's Republic of China [2051st meeting], which is the newest major Member of our Organization to assume its seat.\n188.\tIn the meantime, let us make full use of the United Nations as it is and give it our complete support. Now is a propitious time to begin. We have an energetic, perceptive, resourceful President of the General Assembly, who has already shown himself to be worthy of the example set by his most distinguished predecessors, the latest being the eminent Indonesian statesman, Foreign Minister Adarn Malik.\n189.\tAnd as the successor of our highly esteemed former Secretary-General U Thant, whose sterling worth is indicated by his success in holding \\\"the most impossible job in the world\\\" for over 10 years, we are most fortunate in having Mr. Kurt Waldheim, a man of outstanding vision, integrity and moral courage. Mr. Waldheim is that rare combination of a man of wisdom and a man of action a Secretary-General who is not afraid to take initiatives, to offer his good offices, to practice quiet diplomacy or to speak out clearly and frankly when in his judgment his duties under the Charter require him to do so. He has our full confidence and support.\n190.\tTo sum up our general debate, each year as we gather here to review the problems and the prospects in international affairs, we cannot help being struck by how radically our world has changed in one year's time. What was seen as tentative and problematical in one year has become the immediate reality of the next. A year ago we were preparing for the conference on the environment in Stockholm. Today, following the enormous success of that conference, we have a new and deeper appreciation of the individuality of the earth's biosphere that thin envelope that alone supports life, not just human life but all life. We have acquired in one short year a more profound under-standing of our fundamental interdependence.\n191.\tIn the political realm, in the relations between nations, we have witnessed a no less astounding and vital leap forward toward accommodation an accommodation which, again, has the same roots, conscious or not, in a growing awareness of the essentially of the interdependence of man if we are to have a viable future at all.\n192.\tEach of these vital issues seems to illustrate once again how we are moving into an era of collective responsibility for the globe and its peoples. While maintaining the rich cultural heritage and unique individuality of nations and races, we must by conscious effort surmount the narrow parochialism of unilateral national action whenever it impinges on the well-being of the world as a whole. It is in this light that my Government chooses to view each action taken by our world Organization, holding the firm conviction that with each step will come the insight that will guide us yet further in the harmonization of human affairs.\n"

        "file_text": "On 22 May of this year a change of historic significance occurred in my country: our political status was altered to that of a Republic. At the same time the name of the country, which under Portuguese occupation of the maritime provinces in the fifteenth century had been changed to Ceylon, was dropped and we resumed the name of Sri Lanka, by which my country was referred to in the ancient chronicles and in Valmiki's epic, the Ramayana. The change of name from \\\"Ceylon\\\" to \\\"Sri Lanka\\\"  or \\\"the Resplendent Isle\\\", to give it its closest English translation was not merely a romantic evocation of the past: it was a recognition of the value of our cultural heritage and an affirmation of our cultural affinity with our neighbors in South and Southeast Asia, where the Ramayana is a literary and cultural masterpiece of imperishable value. Therefore, today-for the first time\u2014I address you, Mr. President, and this Assembly as the permanent representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations.\n142.\tThe change of Constitution, which took place on 22 May and made us a Republic, severed our link with the British Crown-a link which had lasted for 157 years but Sri Lanka remains within the Commonwealth and will continue to maintain and even endeavor to strengthen the friendly relations that have existed between our country and Britain. This is the spirit that Walt Whitman had in mind when he spoke of that fervent element of manly friendship that is more binding than treaties.\n143.\tMr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Sri Lanka and on my own behalf, I extend to you our cordial felicitations on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. In congratulating your country and you, we are also congratulating the General Assembly on having selected a President who has already given ample evidence of his adroitness and ability in steering the work of the Assembly and especially in the delicate handling of highly contentious issues. A session that started in a tempest of dissension and acrimony has, through your able captaincy, been placed on an even keel. The weather may turn inclement once again, but at least we feel sure that we are in safe hands. My delegation will at all times be ready to extend to you without reservation its fullest co-operation.\n144.\tAs your predecessor we had an eminent Asian, Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, to whom we owe a word of deep appreciation for the manner in which he directed the work of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. That session witnessed the triumph of justice and reason over prejudice and partisanship with the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and thereby brought us closer to the ideal of universality, which is an indispensable condition for the fulfillment of the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n145.\tFor the first time after about nine years we are without the serene personality of UThant, our former Secretary-General, whose shining attributes of compassion and unassailable moral and intellectual integrity captivated the minds and hearts of all those who had the privilege of being associated with him during his tenure of office. With an endearing humility of spirit and a total lack of ostentation, speaking with courage and acting with discretion and restraint as the occasion demanded, he made a lasting imprint on international relations.\n146.\tWe had an opportunity last year [2031st meeting] to welcome his successor, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose long experience in foreign affairs and international relations will prove an invaluable asset to the Organization. Mr. Waldheim has already demonstrated a sturdy independence, an unflinching initiative and an unfaltering determination to exploit to the limit the scope and authority of his high office. Anyone who displays a vigorous initiative in an organization of such diverse and conflicting interests and policies faces the risk of criticism, often of a captious and destructive nature. I am sure it will not take long for the Organization to realize that It owes as great a duty to the Secretary-General as the Secretary-General himself owes to the Organization, and that duty is to co-operate in a constructive manner in the pursuit of the high ideals to which we have pledged ourselves.\n147.\tSince we last met, there have been many dramatic changes and developments in international affairs and international relationships which cannot but enhance the prospects of international peace and security and help mitigate or eliminate the tensions that have afflicted the world ever since the end of the Second World War. Along with the numerous speakers who have preceded me in this debate and who have made reference to those trends, we welcome the improvement in the relations between the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and Poland and the Soviet Union on the other, through the signing of the Warsaw treaty  and the Moscow Treaty,  and also the progress towards the establishment of a fraternal understanding between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. These measures, and the complementary stage of the same process that would be a conference on European security and co-operation held between the western and eastern parts of Europe and including the United States of America and Canada, an important element of which would be an agreement on a mutual and balanced reduction of forces in that \\\"art of the world, are a tribute to those national leaders who have worked tirelessly for their realization. We applaud these efforts and are gratified by the success that has so far attended them and express our sincere wishes for their final consummation, which would make Europe the envy of the rest of the world and an example worthy of emulation. We would only hope that, while justifiably and understandably concentrating on the improvement of relations between themselves, the architects of European security will not consider themselves relieved of any responsibility for assisting in the creation of similar conditions of peace and stability in other parts of the world and that they will do their utmost to remove the causes of violent conflict and almost incurable enmity in the Middle East, to end the fratricidal war in former IndoChina and also to eradicate the vicious practices and repressive policies that are still pursued by white minority regimes and Governments in Africa and by the Government of Portugal in its African Territories.\n148.\tIn Asia, too, there have been developments in recent times which augur well for the future. The decision of the Governments of China and Japan to establish diplomatic relations with each other will erase the grim and sombre memories of past antagonisms and will, by bringing to an end 35 years of hostility and estrangement, provide the foundation for political, economic and cultural co-operation between two of the most powerful countries in Asia. My delegation would like to pay a tribute to the leaders on both sides for their bold and imaginative statesmanship and especially to the Government of China for its magnanimous gesture in waiving all claim to war reparations. History has shown that peace with penalty is only a respite for revenge. We are confident that in this instance the Chinese Government's decision will prevent a repetition of Europe's unhappy experience after the First World War.\n149.\tAnother development of profound importance is the declared intention of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Japan to commence negotiations leading to a peace treaty between the two countries. The success of these negotiations must have a powerful impact on the political and economic future of Asia.\n150.\tThe leaders of China and the United States are to be congratulated on their endeavors to resume friendly contacts between their Governments and peoples endeavors which were punctuated in dramatic manner by what I believe was the first visit of a United States President to China. Equally welcome and praise worthy are the signs of increasing co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in spheres of common interest and especially in regard to the control of armaments.\n151.\tThe exchanges that have been taking place between North and South Korea through the medium of the Red Cross organizations of the two divided parts of that country will, we hope, be the starting-point in a process that will lead to a final composition of their differences and ultimately bring about the reunification of that country.\n152.\tThese moves towards reconciliation between former foes show a proper respect for the principles of the Charter and disclose a healthy attitude of enlightened self-interest on the part of those concerned. They will help promote conditions conducive to co-operation, stability and progress in Asia.\n153.\tThe Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 between President Bhutto of Pakistan and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India contains the principal elements that can put an end to the mutual suspicion and sullen hostility that have separated India and Pakistan ever since the partition, provided the implementation of the Agreement accords with the spirit of its terms. Given such conscientious implementation of the Agreement, not merely will the risk of future armed clashes be avoided, but there will be a definite assurance that any disagreement that may arise hereafter will be settled amicably and that lasting friendship and enduring co-operation will replace the implacable enmity of the last 25 years. Nothing, therefore, should be allowed to defer such a final implementation of the Agreement.\n154.\tIt is to be hoped that the same spirit will prevail so that a firm and lasting friendship may be established between Pakistan and Bangladesh. For our part we have, like the vast majority of Members of the United Nations, extended diplomatic recognition to Bangladesh and have supported its admission to the specialized agencies. We, therefore, support its application for admission to the United Nations [A/8754S/10759J. We are, however, far from satisfied that the initiative taken to include this item in the General Assembly's agenda under the general title \\\"Admission of new Members to the United Nations\\\" [item 23] is in the best interests of Bangladesh, as it might have exactly the opposite effect from what the proponents of the item intended. The very procedure is of dubious constitutionality. Unfortunately, it is a mark of human frailty that the ends we seek to achieve are too often imperiled by the means we choose to adopt. The interests of Bangladesh would be best served at this juncture if the efforts of the international community were concentrated on removing the obstacles to the establishment of good relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh and on effecting a reconciliation between the two countries which must result inevitably in not merely the recognition by Pakistan of the existence of Bangladesh but also recognition in the full diplomatic sense.\n155.\tWe would draw particular attention to Security Council resolution 307 (1971), which \\\"calls upon all those concerned to take all measures necessary to preserve human life and for the observance of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and to apply in full their provisions as regards the protection of the wounded and sick, prisoners of war and the civilian population\\\". We trust that, if there are impediments, legal or practical or even political, which obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Conventions regarding the repatriation of the prisoners of war, they will be speedily removed, due regard being given to articles 118 and 119 of the third Geneva Convention.  At the same time, we hope that the 30,000. Bengalis who belonged to the Pakistan armed forces and the approximately 10,000 Bengali administrative personnel now in Pakistan will be permitted to exercise their option to build their future in Bangladesh and help in the reconstruction and development of that country.\n156.\tWe make these observations, not in any spirit of criticism, but from a desire to see peace and friendly relations established and maintained throughout the entire subcontinent. We are inclined to believe that this result could be achieved if the parties concerned were left to their own devices without any interference from outside other than encouragement and assistance in attaining agreement.\n157.\tThere are many here, we are aware, who treat the prisoner-of-war issue as the crux of the problem, rather than the recognition by Pakistan of Bangladesh-however devoutly we may wish such recognition to be accorded. It would not be consonant with the spirit and the letter of the third Geneva Convention of 1949 to make the recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan a condition of the release of the prisoners of war. The third Geneva Convention is patently clear on the conditions that should govern the release of prisoners of war. At the same time we must point out that the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations cannot be made subject to the release of the prisoners of war.\n158.\tOur appeal to all the parties concerned would be to work for a settlement the principal and indispensable elements of which would be the release of all prisoners of war, excluding those liable to trial for crimes committed in the prosecution of the war, and the repatriation by Pakistan of the 30,000 Bengalis who were members of the Pakistan armed forces and of the approximately 10,000 Bengali civilians in Pakistan, most of whom are administrators, provided they wish to return. There is a third element, the mutual recognition of Bangladesh and Pakistan, which we would commend to them. If agreement is reached on these measures, if action to implement them is synchronized and if there are reliable guarantees -against the breach of the obligations assumed under such an agreement, the main obstacle to the creation of peace and harmony throughout the subcontinent would be removed. The Simla Agreement has already provided a favourable climate for a final solution, and other outstanding issues such as the question of assets and liabilities, which have been satisfactorily resolved in the past on the Indian subcontinent, should present no insuperable problem.\n159.\tThe war in IndoChina continues a war without mercy and a war without end-heaping misery and devastation on an area already bled white by more than 30 years of continuous warfare and ruined and devastated by a policy of relentless bombing surpassing in scale anything experienced during the Second World War. Is it not possible to profit by the lessons of history and to accept the reality that the human spirit, in the defense of what it considers to be its legitimate rights, is indomitable and indestructible and that no weapon has yet been discovered that can reduce it to submission? An entire people may be flattened into eternity, but that spirit will survive. We hope reason and realism will prevail.\n160.\tAlthough the world had been led to believe that a search for a military solution had been disclaimed, it does not appear to have yet been abandoned. What is needed is an immediate cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a fully representative Government of national unity which will have both the political will and the capacity to repair the havoc of war and release the people of Viet-Nam from the terror that has haunted them for three decades.\n161.\tWe in Sri Lanka view with increasing anxiety and concern the present state of relations between the Soviet Union and China and the lack of progress towards a reconciliation between China and India. The misunderstandings that separate these nations, whose cordial relationship with one another once offered the brightest hope for Asian progress and unity, must be overcome without the least delay, not merely in the interests of the Asian continent alone, but in the greater interest of international peace and security, thereby releasing the energies and resources of their peoples for the more constructive task of economic development.\n162.\tIn the Middle East a tenuous ceasefire has been rudely disturbed by a sudden eruption of acts of terrorism and violence directed against innocent persons and these acts have served as a pretext for savage reprisals no less grotesquely brutal and terroristic than those which they seek to punish. The United States Secretary of State, Mr. William Rogers, showed admirable statesmanship and fair-mindedness in his treatment of this explosive question when he addressed the General Assembly /2038th meeting]. His objectivity and perceptiveness were in luminous contrast to the approach of others to a problem that should take both humanitarian and political factors into account.\n163.\tThere are too many inclined to imagine that terrorism began in Munich. We have no hesitation in condemning terrorism, irrespective of those who resort to it, but if we are genuinely interested in putting an end to terrorism, and not merely in seeking in a spirit of partisanship to make political capital of acts of terrorism, we must examine, and strive to extirpate, the causes of terrorism and the situations which drive men to such acts. The causes are despair and frustration- despair at ever getting justice from the Organization chiefly responsible for the injustice. Despair of this type is no different from lunacy and finds expression either in melancholy brooding or in insensate violence. The several hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have lost their homes, who daily witness the demolition of their houses and the expropriation of their property with meaningless offers of compensation and without the dimmest hope of proper restitution, have been forgotten by the Organization responsible for their fate and their plight.\n164.\tAs Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories, I have been deeply disturbed by the attitude of many Members of this Organization when the reports of the Special Committee are considered, Members who think it fair and proper to abstain in the vote on draft resolutions protesting unmistakable and proven violations of the human rights of the population of the occupied territories, but who suddenly find themselves roused out of their torpor by the senseless savagery displayed at Munich and at the Lod airport. Had this Organization acted in a responsible manner, the events at Munich and Lod would not have stained the pages of contemporary history. To the credit of the Secretary-General, it must be stated that at the first opportunity he did bring the question before this Assembly [A/8791 and Add.lJ, but the record of the voting at the 2037th meeting on the eminently fair, reasonable and objective amendment moved by the representative of Saudi Arabia [A/L.673], which chose to put the problem in its proper perspective and to focus attention on the causes of terrorism rather than on the condemnation of individual acts, clearly shows that what is still needed is a more widespread sense of impartiality and justice in the treatment of this problem. Thanks to the representative of Saudi Arabia, we shall now be able to go to the root of the problem and to deal with it in a manner which we hope will prevent future Munichs and Lods.\n165.\tWe have already referred to the vicious practices of apartheid in Africa and Portugal's ruthless suppression of the freedom movement in its African territories. There are disturbing signs that on the most specious of pretexts, but prompted solely by material considerations of economic advantage, certain Western Powers, in reckless and unconscionable disregard for moral principle or legal obligation, are providing encouragement, solace and support to the regimes and policies of the white minorities in Africa, which have been universally condemned. Nobody could have taken seriously the argument that a denial of foreign investment to South Africa would only injure the interests of the black Africans.\n166.\tWe have on our agenda again this year the items relating to the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [item 35] and a World Disarmament Conference /item 26]. In addition, we have a new item assigned for discussion in plenary meetings and entitled \\\"Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [item 25J.\n167.\tThe Secretary-General's report [A/8775 and Add. 1-4] does not disclose any original suggestions from any State regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, nor has the Security Council itself so far succeeded in presenting a report on performance, though drafts have been presented which are no more than a restatement of our obligations.\n168.\tAs for the World Disarmament Conference, we do not object to the participation of all States in the discussion of this vital subject, but it is an admission of the failure of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, after all these years of its existence and after an enlargement of its membership, that it is now considered necessary to hold a world conference on disarmament. The approach to disarmament continues to be materialistic rather than moralistic: the approach of reducing armaments and outlawing certain types of weapons of mass destruction rather than examining the circumstances that impel countries to engage in an arms race and the causes of war and making an effort to eliminate them. Yet another preposterous fallacy is that nuclear testing is regarded essentially as a matter of pollution; hence the excitement displayed at the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment over atmospheric tests. We work ourselves into ecstasy over the two super-Powers' treaty limiting the number of anti-ballistic missile systems that they may retain and their agreement on limitations on strategic offensive weapons. The limits that those Powers still permit themselves for the development and the further sophistication of nuclear weapons will not reduce in the least the threat of annihilation that faces the world as long as nuclear weapons are held by any State or States. Possessing the capacity to destroy each other and even the world several times over, the super-Powers cannot expect the world to be overwhelmed with relief over agreements which merely curtail the multiple lethal capacity that they already possess. We would suggest that what we need is a world conference on the removal of the causes of war through the total elimination of injustice and the adoption of positive measures for the removal of social and economic inequalities between nations. That is the true meaning of peace and progress.\n169.\tAs regards the materialistic approach to disarmament, we have consistently maintained that the only guarantee of the avoidance of a nuclear war lies in a program of action to which all nuclear Powers would be irrevocably committed and which would comprise the following measures: in the first instance, a categorical undertaking by the nuclear Powers not to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States, combined with an unequivocal and total renunciation of the right to use nuclear weapons; second, the conclusion of a complete or comprehensive test-ban treaty by the prohibition of underground tests; third, the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons and the freezing of the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons; and fourth, the gradual dismantling of the total apparatus of nuclear terror.\n170.\tWe have no right to condemn any country which conducts atmospheric tests, especially if it has only an embryonic nuclear armory, while we leave others free to conduct underground tests to add to an already existing nuclear armory of phenomenal proportions.\n171.\tWe must express our disappointment at the failure of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to produce a draft agreement on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their elimination from the arsenals of all States. We recall that there was an implied assurance on the part of those major Powers that were pressing for the adoption of the Convention on bacteriological weapons last year that, if it was adopted, we could expect to be rewarded with an agreement on the banning of chemical weapons this year. We cannot but help observing that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has not kept faith with the General Assembly.\n172.\tOur general approach to the question of international peace and security and to disarmament, which is that it must seek to remove the causes of war, dictates our attitude to the question of the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. There is an appealing touch of idealism in the contention that if the question of the non-use of force calls for prohibiting the use of weapons of all types, all States will be in a position of equality and none will receive unilateral military advantages. We cannot but agree with the proposition, as stated in the Soviet memorandum regarding the inclusion of this item in the agenda [A/8793], self-evident as that proposition is, that the prohibition of the use of both nuclear and conventional weapons is fully in keeping with the principle of ensuring an equal measure of security for all States. But it appears to us that in the conditions that exist in the world today such an approach is lacking in realism. We very much wish that the assumptions underlying it were justified. Those who advance this proposition must ask themselves, why is it that States wish to arm themselves either with nuclear or conventional weapons or both, and how could the prohibition of the use of such weapons be reconciled with the right to produce and possess them and, further, what exactly is meant by an equal measure of security for all States? We can exhaust all the resources of rhetoric in the discussion of such questions on such premises and assumptions, but we forget that, even if all men are supposed to have been born equal, all nations are not, and never can be, equal in power or capacity.\n173.\tWe feel a sense of dismay that countries which appeal to us to refrain from the use of force in international relations and the overwhelming majority of us here have never used force in international relations find it difficult to agree to the one positive and constructive proposal that could promote international peace and security even in the absence of high-sounding declarations, and that is the creation of zones of peace. The fact that at the 2022nd meeting only half the members of this Assembly voted in favor of the 13-Power draft resolution-which became resolution 2832 (XXVI)-presented last year on the initiative of my delegation and the Tanzanian delegation for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace shows how remote we are from reality when we welcome anti-ballistic missile agreements and the limitation of strategic offensive arms, but view with suspicion and apprehension a proposal for the exclusion of a sizable section of the world from the arms race, a proposal which seeks to free that area from the military presence of the powerful nations.\n174.\tWe shall do our utmost at this session to secure some progress in regard to the proposal for declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace and hope that those who have a genuine interest in the strengthening of international peace and security will support our endeavors.\n175.\tAt the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Georgetown, Guyana, in August this year, which was attended by 59 countries as members, a Declaration was adopted in which the Foreign Ministers, noting with satisfaction the adoption by the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, \\\"considered that this initiative of third world countries and non-aligned states was a significant contribution to the strengthening of international security and that its implementation would greatly reinforce the emerging structures of world peace and help create conditions for progress towards the goal of general and complete disarmament. Moreover, they were of the view that the implementation of this Declaration would strengthen the conditions of peace, security and co-operation in an important region of the third world\\\", and agreed to co-ordinate their action at this session of the United Nations. \n176.\tThe Georgetown Conference also noted that \\\"the Mediterranean is increasingly becoming an area for the display of rival military forces\\\" and \\\"welcomed the initiative taken towards convening a conference of non- aligned Mediterranean countries and those anxious and ready to work towards making the Mediterranean a sea of peace and co-operation among the peoples of the area\\\". \n177.\tSo far as the proposal for declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace is concerned, our ultimate objective is the removal of all foreign bases from the territories of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean; but our first step must be to secure the exclusion of great-Power rivalry and the great-Power military presence from the Indian Ocean, without denying any littoral or hinterland State the right to maintain a military potential that would satisfy the minimum requirements of its security and guarantee it freedom from external interference.\n178.\tAlong with other non-aligned countries present at the Georgetown Conference, we expressed our satisfaction at the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 27 November 1971 by five South-east Asian countries, which \\\"expressing their determination to secure recognition of and respect for Southeast Asia as a Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality, free from any form of menace or interference by outside Powers . . . welcomed this move as a positive development and called upon all States to respect these objectives\\\". My Government supports the Kuala Lumpur Declaration without reservation.\n179.\tLet me now turn to those problems that affect the daily lives and the general well-being of our people, namely, the problems of trade and development. The most significant event of the year was the third session of UNCTAD, held in Santiago, Chile. Once more the hopes of developing countries to secure from UNCTAD, in pursuance of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)}, specific and positive commitments from the developed countries to measures and policies designed to improve the trading prospects of developing countries and the volume, conditions and terms of financial aid for their development were disappointed.\n180.\tThe address to the third session of UNCTAD by Mr. Robert S. McNamara, President of the World Bank the first occasion on which he addressed such a conference-contains some illuminating, if depressing, statistics. The President drew pointed attention to the fact that in the poorest countries of the world, those with a per capita gross national product of less than $200 but comprising 67 per cent of the population of the world, per capita income during the First Development Decade grew at a rate of only 1.5 per cent annually and that, although the developed countries, in adopting the Strategy for the Second Development Decade and in order to meet the targets for growth, agreed that external aid to be provided in the form of official development assistance should reach 0.7 per cent of the gross national product by 1975, the contribution from the wealthiest nation in the world, the United States, whose gross national product is roughly half of the total gross national product of the developed countries, showed a steady decline from above 0.5 per cent in the early years of the last decade to 0.31 per cent in 1970, with the prospect of a further fall to about 0.24 per cent by 1975. The President of the World Bank came to the disturbing conclusion that the total flow of official development assistance for the first half of the Decade was likely to reach approximately 0.35 per cent of the gross national product, or only half the target for the Decade.\n181.\tOther statistics quoted by the President of the World Bank demonstrate even more startlingly the gaping chasm between the standards of living of the developed countries, with a quarter of the world's population, and the standards of living of the remaining three quarters of the world's population that live in the developing countries. The average per capita income in the developed countries, as the President of the World Bank pointed out, is approximately $2,400 per annum compared with the figure of $180 in the developing countries; by 1980 the per capita income in the developed countries is expected to rise by approximately $1,200 compared with an increase of less than $100 in per capita income in the developing countries, even given the attainment of the growth target set for the Second Development Decade. The President of the World Bank also pointed out that at constant prices the total gross national product of the developed countries is expected to rise from $2,000 billion in 1970 to $3,000 billion by 1980 and that if the developed countries have to raise the present level of official development assistance, which stands at 0.35 per cent of their gross national product, to the target of 0.7 per cent which they have set themselves, they need transfer to the developing countries only 1.5 per cent of the increase in their gross national product, or $15 billion, leaving the balance of 98.5 per cent of the increase, or $985 billion, to meet their own internal needs. It is almost like an excess profits tax or sumptuary tax of 1.5 per cent, which they can comfortably afford and the benefit of which they will receive as the purchasing power of the beneficiaries of their aid increases.\n182.\tThose statistics, even if the figures of assistance reflect only official development assistance, show how far removed promise is from fulfillment. The developing countries must rely overwhelmingly on official development assistance, as private development assistance does not always favor the social aspirations or appreciate the economic policies and political problems of the recipient countries.\n183.\tIt is in the light of these realities that the achievement of the third session of UNCTAD must be judged. The question of stable prices for primary commodities, on which the majority of developing countries depend to a disproportionate extent for their earnings of foreign exchange to finance their development schemes, received cavalier treatment at that session. Some slight success was achieved in regard to the scheme of supplementary financing to provide facilities better, more dependable and more timely than those existing at present through the International Monetary Fund in order to rescue the development plans of developing countries from the dislocation and disruption that could be caused by unforeseen declines in their export earnings. With the support of the United Kingdom, Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, the developing countries secured a resolution which calls for the preparation of a scheme, including an assessment of its cost, which would enable the international community to agree to provide the resources to finance the scheme. \n184.\tThe third session of UNCTAD also failed to achieve any real progress in regard to the proposal for establishing a link between special drawing rights and aid for development or in regard to the acceptance of the principle that the major share of the next issue of special drawing rights should go to the developing countries. Once again, the United Kingdom's more progressive attitude helped to secure a recognition from the Conference of the need for the subject of the link to be given the most serious attention, and for the International Monetary Fund to be requested to study and report as early as possible, with a view to the possible implementation of a viable scheme. As I remarked in a different forum, I hope this will not go down in history as the missing link.\n185.\tIn regard to the reform of the international monetary system, some slight satisfaction was obtained by the developing countries like a crumb from the rich man's table-in the form of the representation of the developing countries in the group to which the task of making proposals for the reform of the international monetary system was entrusted, the Committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues.\n186.\tTo sum up, the third session of UNCTAD gave the developing countries some little hope, but no help. In approaching the future the developing countries would do well to take serious note of the fact that the contemporary economic scene is dominated, and will for some time be dominated, by four economic giants. There is the new phenomenon of the international economic cartel, regionally organized and best exemplified by the European Common Market, which as from January 1973 will grow in size, capacity and influence with the accession of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland. The other three giants are the world's most powerful economy, that of the United States, the formidable economy of Japan, with new prospects opening up to it through improved relations with its most powerful neighbors, and, at the other end of the scale, the closely-knit, State controlled economies of the socialist countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Those which are left are the developing countries, known as the \\\"Group of 77\\\" but actually consisting of about 95 countries, with little prospect or means of co-operation except in their appeals to the developed nations.\n187.\tSri Lanka's experience in regard to the problem of commodity prices and the maintenance of a proper equilibrium in its terms of trade is almost without parallel. For nearly two decades we have suffered a steady and persistent deterioration in our terms of trade, which fell from an annual average of 142 for the period 1952-1956 to an average of 88 for the period 1968-1970. While at first the deterioration was due chiefly to the rapid rise in import'prices accompanied by stagnation in export prices, the problem has been accentuated more recently by a sharp drop in rubber prices. As regards our foreign reserves, the average deficit rose from 69 million rupees for the period 1952-1956 to an average of 1,003 million rupees for the period 1968-1970. It is little comfort to us to be told that we must tighten our belts. What we need is the means to tide us over our difficulties and the external finance to keep our industrial sector operating to full capacity so as to prevent increasing unemployment.\n188.\tForeign assistance in appropriate quantities on easy terms and at the moment of need is vital to our survival. The most striking example of such assistance and one which on behalf of my Government I must acknowledge with profound gratitude is the munificent aid received by my country at a critical period last year from the Government of the People's Republic of China, which gave us a freely convertible foreign-exchange loan of $25 million, free of interest, with repayment spread over 12 years after a grace period of three years. The features of this loan taken together make it unique in the history of foreign aid. Again this year, during the course of the state visit to Peking of my Prime Minister, Mrs. Bandaranaike, the Government of the People's Republic of China gave further and convincing evidence of its generosity and good will towards developing countries and its determination to adhere to the policy of foreign aid which it commended to the participants at the third session of UNCTAD.\n189.\tWhile singling out the People's Republic of China for special mention, and that for good reason, I should like on behalf of my Government to express our sincere thanks to the members of the Aid Ceylon Consortium and others who do not belong to it for the help that they have given us in the past and continue to give us. We are not unmindful of the official assistance given to us on very liberal terms by Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom-a true mark of Commonwealth solidarity that transcends all other differences.\n190.\tDuring its spring and summer sessions the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction succeeded -in making sufficient progress, especially through the adoption of a list of subjects and issues [A/8721 and Corr.l, para. 23] to be brought before the third United Nations conference on the law of the sea, to justify the General Assembly in preparing for the contingency of a formal inauguration of the conference some time next year while the General Assembly is in session and to ask the Committee to utilize the provision made for two sessions in the spring and summer of 1973 to advance its preparations for the conference.,\n191.\tDiscussions in the Committee during the past two years have made it transparently clear that agreement on the various issues which will come before the third conference on the law of the sea will be attainable only if there is a willingness to revise the archaic interpretation of the existing doctrine of the freedom of the high seas, which does not provide for equality of opportunity in fact, but only in theory, and if the extent of the demand for the adoption of the concept of an economic zone or patrimonial sea is appreciated. Inflexible adherence to the practices hitherto permitted and the privileges hitherto enjoyed by a relatively few major maritime Powers under their anachronistic interpretation of the doctrine of the freedom of the high seas will need to be replaced by a more just and equitable adaptation of that doctrine to suit the economic realities of the modern world. The conference should become not a confrontation between the major maritime Powers and the rest of the world but rather an occasion for the mutual accommodation of their interests and needs, subject to the paramount consideration of reducing the existing economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries.\n192.\tWe do not want the weak to inherit the earth. All that we ask is that the powerful should help the weak to build a world in which an increasing measure of social justice between nations can be realized, so that in the remaining .years of this century the United Nations can succeed in redeeming the bleak record of its first 27 years.\n"

        "file_text": "Comrade President, on behalf of the Polish delegation and on my own behalf I wish to offer you heartfelt congratulations upon your election to the high post of President of the present session. Your election is viewed by the Polish delegation as an expression of the appreciation by the United Nations of the peaceful and constructive work of the Polish People's Republic at the international level.\n55.\tMay I now be permitted to present Poland's position on some of the key issues facing the international community today.\n56.\tAt the present session of the General Assembly, Poland can note with satisfaction the favorable direction in which the international situation is developing in Europe. This direction was determined by such events as the coming into force of the Treaties between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany,  the four-Power agreement on West Berlin  and the agreement concluded on this question between the two German States on 17 December 1971 and that concluded between the German Democratic Republic and the Senate of West Berlin on 20 December 1971.\n57.\tThe recognition of political and territorial realities which resulted from the defeat of the Third Reich reflected in those agreements provides a good point of departure from which the situation can evolve towards detente and a basis for the strengthening of security and for the consolidation of peaceful co-operation.\n58.\tThis is all the more important in so far as in the past, owing to historical factors, a number of antagonisms were built up in Europe which culminated in two World Wars in the course of this century. After the Second World War, along the line where the two largest military and political blocs of the contemporary world meet-the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization- there were recurring and dangerous tensions, to mention only those relating to West Berlin.\n59.\tOf the European antagonisms, the centuries-old German-Polish conflict engendered by the eastward pressure of German aggressive forces was especially acute. It was no coincidence that the Second World War began with the aggression launched by the Nazi Reich against Poland.\n60.\tPoland's western frontier on the Oder and the Lusatian Neisse established by the Potsdam Agreement of 1 August 1945 eliminated the territorial consequences of the expansion of German imperialism and created possibilities for shaping relations in Central Europe on a new foundation. Poland's neighbor, the German Democratic Republic, had drawn the correct conclusions and recognized that frontier in the Zgorzelec Agreement of 1950, which created the foundation of relations of real friendship between Poland and the German Democratic Republic. In the Treaty on the Bases for the Normalization of Relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, too, recognized this frontier as inviolable, thus providing a final settlement of the question of the recognition of Poland's western frontier in accordance with international law and thereby creating a basis for the normalization of relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany. The recent establishment of diplomatic relations between the two States constitutes another step in this direction. This agreement proves that there are no international problems so complex as to defy solution by negotiation if all the parties concerned have a will and determination to find a solution.\n61.\tThe fact that the question of frontiers has been settled once and for all is a historical victory for the positions held by the Polish people. It is also a victory for the cause of peace inasmuch as any attempt to infringe upon our territorial integrity would constitute a threat to peace in Europe and in the world. It is also a victory for all those nations and Governments that have been providing us with their moral assistance and direct support in our efforts to gain recognition of the Polish western frontier. I wish on behalf of the Polish people to offer our warm thanks to those nations and Governments.\n62.\tThe normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic is now becoming the order of the day. Complete normalization of their relations should be achieved as soon as possible on the basis of the generally accepted standards of international law. It is now a glaring anomaly that the German Democratic Republic should still be discriminated against. It is becoming perfectly obvious that no major European problem can be solved effectively without the participation, in accordance with the principle of equal rights, of that socialist German State, which lies in the very heartland of Europe and has a vast economic potential. Poland is of the opinion that conditions are now ripe for the simultaneous admission of the two German States to the United Nations.\n63.\tThe speedy normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and Czechoslovakia is also necessary.\n64.\tThe favorable political developments in Europe which I mentioned earlier facilitated the commencement of\n7 Agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the Republic of Poland regarding the Demarcation of the German-Polish Frontier, signed at Zgorzelec on 6 July 1950 multilateral preparatory talks on holding a European conference, with the participation of the United States and Canada, which could start constructing a lasting system of security and co-operation throughout the whole of Europe.\n65.\tPoland's special involvement in, and active work for, European security stems from her historical experience. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, for nearly a century and a half, Poland was deprived of independent existence as a sovereign State. Subsequently, after 20 years of independence, it fell victim to Nazi aggression, and paid an extremely high price to regain its freedom and independence. For Poland, then, security and the opportunity for international co-operation are of basic importance.\n66.\tBut there still exist certain political forces in Europe which stake their future on the continuation of tensions and artificial dividing-lines. Such a development in European relations, however, is contrary to the universal desire of peoples for the peaceful coexistence of nations, since wide segments of the people in all European countries, as well as among their ruling circles, are beginning to realize that all European States, regardless of the differences in their systems, have a common interest in striving for peaceful and secure development, There is a growing conviction that to safeguard these common fundamental interests in existing conditions is not only necessary but also practicable through our common efforts and a constructive program of action.\n67.\tThe Soviet Union, Poland and other socialist countries have long been proposing such a program. A number of documents issued jointly by the socialist States, and in particular the latest document adopted in Prague last January by the Political Advisory Committee of States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, elaborated further on this program and made it more concrete, thus providing a platform for a more lively dialog which has confirmed the desirability of convening a European conference on security and co-operation.\n68.\tIn our opinion, conditions have now been created in Europe for the establishment of a system of commitments to safeguard the inviolability of existing frontiers and ensure respect for the territorial integrity of all States, the non-use of force and the elimination of the threat of its use in inter-State relations, while confirming the principles of the equality and sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\n69.\tAt present conditions are ripe for the acceleration of steps to expand co-operation among all European States in the fields of economy, science, technology, culture and protection of the natural environment. However, such co-operation will be fully beneficial only when the old model of relations based on the armaments race and a balance of fear between opposing military and political blocs is replaced by an all-European system of collective security.\n70.\tMuch still remains to be done in the field of the expansion of free trade in Europe. The abolition of import-export restrictions is one of the first steps that must be taken towards this goal.\n71.\tThe two integrated economic structures which are developing in Europe the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community-being the result of an objective process of economic integration do not by themselves constitute an obstacle to inter-European co-operation. However, impediments arise when, for political reasons, West European integration implies discrimination against non-member partners and the disruption of the natural inter-European ties. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, in its forms of economic integration, is free from any discriminatory practices vis-a-vis non-member partners. We expect the member States of the European Economic Community to respect such principles inasmuch as it is only such all-round co-operation that can gradually bring about changes in psychological attitudes and in the minds of people, thus closing the gap of mistrust between them. Such co-operation would also facilitate progress in the field of disarmament, leading to the allocation of major means for the settlement of the urgent economic and social problems of our planet.\n72.\tPoland desires to contribute most constructively to the new era beginning in Europe and to the vision of the future of Europe which is now emerging.\n73.\tFor many years now Poland has been building relations with numerous West European States on the principles of peaceful coexistence. Relations between Poland and France are developing very well indeed. The traditional ties of friendship linking our two peoples are being transformed into ever more constructive co-operation in many fields, benefiting both Poland and France. Similarly, Poland is shaping her relations with the Nordic States, with which for quite some time we have been engaged in a useful dialog regarding European issues and with which we have enjoyed advantageous co-operation which is developing well in the fields of economy and culture and in other areas of interest.\n74.\tGuided by our concern for the security and peaceful development of Europe we have begun the process of normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany relations which are severely affected by the tragic historical experience of the Polish nation. We were gratified to see the positive evolution of the policies of the Federal Republic of Germany and the contribution of the Brandt Scheel Government to the detente in Europe, expressed in the recognition of realities indispensable to the present and future development of interState relations in central Europe. This, despite the retrograde forces of opposition which are active in that State, justifies our approaching with confidence the settling of the bilateral problems which confront us in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Treaty concluded by our two States.\n75.\tWe wish to expand dynamically, as in the past, our relations with Italy, the Benelux countries, neutral Austria and other European countries as well.\n76.\tI have been discussing these matters primarily in the European context. One of the reasons for this approach is my belief that the comprehensive form for co-operation in resolving numerous problems within the framework of the European continent can and should play a positive role in stimulating co-operation with States in other parts of our globe, and first and foremost with the developing countries.\n77.\tWe attach major importance to the systematic cementing of political, economic and cultural bonds with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Mindful of the ambitious developmental aspirations of those countries we shall help them to the best of our abilities by providing them with assistance and shall share with them the experience we have acquired in the process of overcoming our inherited economic backwardness and in the course of our present dynamic development.\n78.\tIn Latin America, Asia and Africa many countries continue to be subjected to various forms of political and economic pressures devised to dissuade them from effecting progressive internal reforms and from pursuing independent foreign policies. Poland will, as it has been doing up till now, consistently favor the position that the legitimate rights of all countries and peoples of those continents should be respected.\n79.\tWe are also expanding our relations with the United States. The recent visit to Warsaw paid by Mr. Richard Nixon, the President of the United States, was an important development in Polish-American relations and no doubt has contributed to the expansion of our mutual relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n80.\tAlso, recently, we have noted that further progress is being made in various fields owing inter alia to the talks held several days ago between the representatives of the Governments of Poland and of the United States. Poland, a socialist State consolidating its alliances and common activities with the countries of the socialist community, wishes to expand its relations with the United States in the interests of strengthening peace and security and of developing co-operation between States having different socio-political systems.\n81.\tThe detente in international relations achieved during the recent period is an iron-clad This is first of all a great achievement by the Soviet Union and the entire socialist community through the program of peace adopted by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and consistently implemented by the Soviet political leadership. The detente in international relations is also an achievement by all those realistic forces in the world which have for years now been treating the concept of peaceful coexistence as the sole basis for the development of international relations ensuring peace and security.\n82.\tIt was with great satisfaction that Poland welcomed the fact that as a result of the talks between Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other Soviet leaders, and Mr. Richard Nixon, the President of the United States, the principles of peaceful coexistence were accepted as a basis for the relations between the two great Powers.\n83.\tPoland also acclaims the agreements achieved on the question of the limitation of strategic nuclear armament's and hopes for the further and fruitful continuation of the talks on the limitation of strategic armaments and hopes for the further and fruitful continuation of the talks on the limitation of strategic armaments in order to make progress in the direction of the elimination of this most dangerous of weapons.\n84.\tI wish to express our full support for the proposal put forth recently by Andrei Gromyko, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, on the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [A/8793].\n85.\tWe fully endorse the initiative to convene a world disarmament conference. At present there are proper conditions for the convening of such an authoritative forum and for ensuring that its debates would produce positive results.\n86.\tThe implementation of those initiatives would constitute another step towards the attainment of the fundamental goal of nations and of the United Nations, that is to say, the strengthening of security, the consolidation of peace and an expansion of international co-operation.\n87.\tThe principles of peaceful coexistence and equal co-operation among countries are indivisible and cannot be applied selectively only to certain countries or to certain regions alone.\n88.\tThe echoes of bombs being dropped on towns and villages in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, on South Viet-Nam and on other countries in IndoChina arouse condemnation and protest in Poland and serve to strengthen solidarity with the peoples of IndoChina, who are waging a heroic struggle for their freedom. Because of its membership in the International Supervisory Commission for IndoChina, Poland also demands that an end be put to the war in VietNam and favors a peaceful solution to the conflict in accordance with the proposals submitted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of VietNam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.\n89.\tHighly alarming is the intransigence with which Israel continues to refuse to implement Security Council resolution 242(1967). We believe that the Arab territories occupied by Israel must be returned to their rightful owners. Only on such basis can the conflict in the Middle East be resolved and conditions created for the safe existence and development of all States and nations of that area.\n90.\tIn the course of recent years we have been witnessing increased terrorist activities in which innocent people lost their lives. I wish to emphasize that Poland condemns acts of violence and terror as they poison the international atmosphere and increase international tensions. We are in favor of effective steps to prevent such acts. However, the slogan of combating terrorism cannot be used to restrict the right of peoples to struggle against aggressors occupying their lands, nor can it be used to serve the policies of colonialism, racialism and discrimination. In condemning and combating terrorism we should be aware that the source and root cause of terrorism are the practices resorted to by invaders, colonialists and racists and it should be precisely the root-causes that we should seek to eliminate.\n91.\tPoland attaches major importance to the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Problems relating to our participation in the work of the United Nations were discussed in the useful talks we had with the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, during his recent visit to Poland.\n92.\tWe feel that the United Nations should concentrate on the consolidation of peace and international security. The Organization should also continue to play an active and inspiring role in the development of international co-operation in economic and social matters. Our Organization can and should play an important role in making peaceful use of the achievements of the scientific and technological revolution. The war against hunger calls for intensified efforts by the United Nations. Our Organization can contribute to the goal of making rational use of the resources of the seas and oceans for the benefit of the whole of mankind. The problems of the use and exploitation of outer space require further regulation. And, last but not least, the need for the preservation and proper protection of the natural environment of man is ever more universally felt.\n93.\tSuch is the catalog, far from complete, of problems which in the near future will be absorbing the attention of our Organization.\n94.\tPoland is deeply convinced that the United Nations meets all the conditions for coping with these tasks. This conviction stems from the evaluation of the past activities of the United Nations. The balance-sheet of the Organization's work is positive in principle. But this does not prevent us from seeing the shortcomings which we have observed on more than one occasion, and which we continue to observe, in the activities of the United Nations.\n95.\tPoland, which has consistently defended the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter, wishes to emphasize once again that the path towards improving the activity of the United Nations lies, not in a revision of the Charter, but in a fuller utilization of the constructive possibilities provided by its provisions. One of the fundamental conditions is the implementation of the principle of the universality of our Organization.\n96.\tIt is also of essential importance to maintain administration within reasonable limits and to remedy the Organization's financial situation, in order to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations.\n97.\tWe believe that when these conditions are met-and also given the active role and assistance of the Secretary- General, who with great energy has begun discharging the tasks entrusted to him our Organization will not fail to live up to the hopes placed in it by mankind. Poland, as heretofore, is ready to contribute actively to resolving the important issues confronting the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in electing you to preside over its twenty-seventh session, the General Assembly has asserted its confidence in you and no choice could have been more justified. This is a further recognition of your great country, with which Algeria enjoys privileged relations of friendship and co-operation, a country that has constantly been respected at each milestone in the history of man. But it is also a tribute to your personal worth.\n269.\tIn your delicate post you succeed Mr. Adam Malik, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, a sister and friendly nation, as close to our hearts as it is distant geographically. We would venture to tell him again how proud we were to co-operate with him and to express our admiration for the invaluable contribution he made to the prestige of the Organization.\n270.\tFor the first time, a familiar figure is absent from our debates. U Thant stepped down with all the modesty and simplicity to which he had accustomed us. However, we cannot forget his great contribution to the Organization, and we take this opportunity to express to him our gratitude for the constant devotion with which he served the cause of peace and understanding among peoples.\n271.\tAlgeria is gratified that the General Assembly elected, to succeed U Thant and to continue his work, the new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whom we wish to assure of our friendship and whole-hearted co-operation. Mr. Waldheim has, we know, one of the most difficult of all tasks, but he will bring to bear the qualities of heart and mind which we know him to possess, for by the force of circumstances he is called upon to share our worries and assess the scope of our real problems. We know in advance that we can count on his understanding and sympathy. And because we are aware of the weight and complexity of his responsibilities, he can be sure today as at all times that we will support him and assist him when we can.\n272.\tThe last session of the General Assembly began under the symbol of hope and understanding, but the year that has elapsed has only confirmed the apprehensions then voiced at length from this rostrum. In fact, at a time when a healthier atmosphere seemed progressively to prevail in the relations among the great Powers, increasingly serious crises were affecting other parts of the world.\n273.\tWithout prejudging the true motivations of the great Powers in overcoming the obstacles of the cold war, we had hoped that the evolution of the world would take a new tack, where the fundamental principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations would finally be fully implemented, to the benefit of the international community as a whole.\n274.\tUnfortunately, everyday reality dispelled that illusion. Everything contributed to strengthening that ambiguous tendency in international affairs which develops on two levels: on the one hand, the priority given to the harmonization of relations among the more advanced nations; and on the other, the complacency when it is a question of settling crucial problems confronting the peoples of the third world and bearing on their very survival and the elementary respect for the human person.\n275.\tThis is a basic contradiction. It undermines an international system which we are trying to free of the sequels of the post-war period. The initiatives taken to this end are confronted with the tacit acceptance of the law of the strongest and the rewarding of aggression. Furthermore, aggression seems to have a chosen arena inevitably and always the third world.\n276.\tThe changes during the last few years in relations between the East and West indicate a promising period of evolution. These changes, because they have done away with the difficulties of confrontation and favor the appearance and strengthening of new poles of attraction, should have encouraged a true democratization of international relations.\n277.\tThe conference on European security and co-operation, which is seen as the embodiment of this evolution marked by its first step, the agreement on Berlin, has been followed by the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet- United States summit conference, and the partial agreements on strategic weapons, surrounded by a framework of scientific and trade co-operation. Furthermore, the establishment of a dialog between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China and the establishment of new relations between China and Japan all create conditions conducive to a detente in Asia.\n278.\tThus we are witnessing everywhere a change in the outmoded structures on which world balance earlier rested. The process started in Europe will, of course, have repercussions on international relations as a whole. Such a change in the framework of discussions among partners belonging to different social, economic and political systems will obviously raise complex problems. However, the agreements which must necessarily be arrived at should not be oriented towards a redistribution of responsibilities whose consequences will once again be borne by the third world. Such a fear is all the more justified since the European detente might be reflected in an increase in tension around Europe, and, more specifically, in that Mediterranean which, because of permanent Zionist aggression, appears to be the favorite battlefield for confrontation between the two super-Powers.\n279.\tBeyond the military alliances and their implications, the rivalry of the super-Powers keeps an area where they do not belong in a state of growing tension because of the movements of war fleets, the strengthening of bases, political pressures and economic blackmail.\n280.\tBeing a Mediterranean country and naturally concerned at what happens around it, being a non-aligned country which does not look forward to a mere equidistant between the two extremes since it is concerned about everything that touches justice and peace, Algeria works constantly for agreements among States that seek to guarantee their security and safeguard their independence within the framework of a regional solidarity that might discourage greed and attempts at foreign domination. Basically our efforts are directed towards peaceful purposes and co-operation.\n281.\tWithin these prospects the policy of fraternity and good neighborliness pursued by Algeria with all countries of the Maghreb, since it has eliminated factors of dissension, constitutes a significant contribution to the detente in the western Mediterranean region. The involvement of traditional interests between the countries of Western Europe and the countries of the Maghreb ought to lead the former to a more correct assessment of the price paid by countries to maintain an independence that was so dearly bought by all despite the changes in the world and through the complex play of interests and to maintain a rhythm of development which has made Algeria into a dynamic and serious nation. The necessary definition of new relations between a Europe that is eager to reconstruct itself and Algeria will serve as a test for future relations not only between the European Economic Community and North Africa, but also between the more advanced nations and all those that are doing their utmost to eliminate the aftereffects of colonial domination.\n282.\tIt appears that our twenty-seventh session has opened in an atmosphere of particular excitement. Among and around us our debates have suddenly acquired a certain resonance. In other circumstances we might well have rejoiced at the renewed attention given by public opinion to our work here and drawn the reassuring conclusion that once and for all we had overcome the indifference and skepticism which thus far had been shown the Organization. Exploited for emotional and doubtless painful reasons, certain phenomena of the national resistance of a people have been isolated from their true motivations, from their objective context, from their primary causes. What is called terrorism and what, under other skies and in other circumstances, has stood for the very symbol of the vitality of a number of peoples represented here, peoples once oppressed by colonial domination, has now by some unknown conjuration of fate become a shameful stigma and naturally-according to some-a manifestation of barbarism. Therefore, when it is a question of countries which have suffered war for decades, where technological power has become the very instrument of violence, when it is a question of countries which suffer from colonialism and racial segregation, by some chance part of international public opinion seems unable to see things clearly or to differentiate between the aggressor and the victim of aggression. Need I stress again that in the world of today revolutionary violence, wherever it appears, is only the condemnation of international society and of the unjust order which prevails? Thus terrorism is not an evil in itself. It seems rather to be a symptom of the diseases afflicting the world of today. It is these diseases that we must dig out if we want, once and for all, to establish a balance that will be freed of fear and violence, because it will be based on justice among men.\n283.\tNo one is so great as to stand up as an apostle of violence, but no one can be so strong as to condemn violence when it is placed at the service of justice and freedom. Unfortunately, the world will be dominated by violence for a long time to come: violence in the behavior of States, violence in the behavior of individuals. And mankind seems to be condemned to live in constant fear. Yesterday it was fear of a nuclear confrontation between the super-Powers which might have degenerated into a general conflagration and thus wipe out the human species in one fell swoop. Today it is terror caused by peoples pushed to the limit of patience who, doomed to a slow death, to genocide, to disappearance, to diaspora, might well drag the rest of the world into their holocaust. That is assuredly a mature stage of the diseases of contemporary society, which highlights the urgency of devising a cure. We have, of course, been asked to adopt immediate measures to fight against I know not what sort of international terrorism. Could we then simply wipe out the symptoms of the disease without resolving to eradicate the taproots? If the problem of violence can itself raise, indeed justify, controversies and arguments, then the struggle for national liberation, the resistance of a people, remains today as in the past not only a right but a legitimate and sacred duty. In this specific case, to be imperative and fair, revolutionary violence is the justification of existence itself.\n284.\tCan we merely speak of violence without thinking first of the situation in the IndoChinese peninsula? There, American intervention has reached unprecedented intensity and dimensions. Meanwhile, in its declaration of 11 September 1972, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam submitted proposals which were both new and constructive. Without doubt they represent an appreciable contribution to the effort it is making to achieve a just and lasting solution of the VietNamese problem. In proposing the creation in South Viet-Nam of a provisional government of national concord with three equal and united components entrusted with handling matters during the transitional period and organizing truly free and democratic general elections, the Provisional Revolutionary Government has again given proof of its will to find a solution to the internal problem of South Viet-Nam that will guarantee the right of self-determination to the Viet-Namese people while at the same time offering the United States and its allies a chance to put an end to their political and military commitments in honurable conditions.\n285.\tObviously this would allow the vicious circle to be broken, and although the Algerian problem of 10 years ago and the VietNamese problem of today are not really comparable from the point of view of origin, nature or scope, nevertheless the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government are reminiscent of the procedural agreement that was arrived at in Evian with our French partner; that agreement enabled the administering Power to disengage itself with honor and the Algerian people freely to decide its future by means of a referendum of free and democratic self-determination organized by a provisional executive body. Thus Algeria achieved sovereignty and became a country deeply attached to its national independence but open to the widest international co-operation.\n286.\tIn the same way, in Cambodia, peace is still conditioned by respect for the sovereignty of the Khmer people through the return to legitimacy represented by the Royal Government of National Union of Prince Sihanouk, which effectively controls the country and, accentuates daily the isolation of the Phnom Penh regime, the maintenance of which is assured only by the presence of forces of aggression. Furthermore, it is clear that the Government of Prince Sihanouk is the sole authentic representative of the Khmer people and it is as such that the non-aligned nations re-established its rights among them during the Georgetown Conference. That decision is a prelude to the victory of the Khmer people; it will lead the United Nations to consider the problem of the representation of Cambodia at the right time.\n287.\tSimilarly, in Laos, the solution dictated by events as well as by law remains linked to the constitution of a government of national union, as guaranteed by the Geneva Agreements of 1954, which assure to the patriotic forces of that country their rightful and legal place.\n288.\tStill on the continent of Asia, so beset by tribulations and war, the beginning of the dialog between North Korea and South Korea has come as a reminder and a warning to our Organization. We should give all initiatives taken towards defining the principles for the peaceful reunification of Korea free from any foreign interference the immediate attention and support they deserve. By encouraging the process which is now under way the United Nations will undoubtedly recover its prestige, tarnished during the quarter of a century during which it has served as a disguise for the intervention of the imperialist American forces and their allies. Be that as it may, the United Nations must no longer act as a cover for a military presence which it cannot control, or keep alive a commission which manifestly can never carry out its mandate.\n289.\tThe dangerous evolution of the situation in the Middle East lies at the very root of the passions which have been unleashed. Should we really be surprised that things have reached such a pitch when the effects of the Israeli aggression still exist, when the Arab territories are still occupied and the decisions of the Security Council remain a dead letter, despite the remarkable efforts of Ambassador Jarring? The time spent in the search for a peaceful settlement has only resulted in the aggravation of the consequences of the 1967 aggression. Israel has made good use of that time for its policy of conquest and provocation, carrying out a systematic zionisation of all the Palestinian lands and occupied territories belonging to sovereign States Members of the United Nations.\n290.\tAssured of impunity and benefiting from the support of the United States of America, Israel arrogantly spurns anything that does not fit into the framework of its expansionist policy. In these conditions, what can the international community do but assume its responsibility to ensure the application of its decisions? What else can the Arab peoples do but fight for the liberation of their national territory? What else can the Palestinian people do but struggle everywhere and by all possible means to reaffirm its existence, impose recognition of its national identity and recover its usurped homeland?\n291.\tBe that as it may, it is to turn one's back on reality to imagine that a settlement can be found in a balance of forces or by horse-trading in the demarcation of frontiers. Aware that they play a part in world affairs, the Palestinian people know today that no just and lasting peaceful solution can be devised without them, and certainly not against them. The international community also bears a weighty responsibility in that situation, but it, too, can contribute to making a settlement easier by taking into account the legitimate claims of the Palestinian people. The problem is far from simple. But that surely is not sufficient reason for ignoring it. It is not only the fate of an entire people that is at stake: it is stability and peace in that crucial region of the world.\n292.\tThe meetings held by the Security Council in Africa gave rise to perhaps exaggerated hopes on the African continent. But the specific interest shown by our Organization in the problems besetting Africa is itself an encouragement to the movements of national liberation that are struggling against Portuguese colonial domination. For once, the leaders of those movements were allowed to explain and define the situation prevailing in their respective countries and the progress they are achieving in their just struggle. The trust that they have placed in the international community should be echoed, but not merely by pious sympathy and inapplicable or ineffectual resolutions.\n293.\tColonial domination, racial segregation and apartheid are also elements that generate trouble and violence. This is true all over the world whenever racial prejudice rears its head among men in their relations or among peoples in theirs, but the phenomenon acquires more alarming proportions in southern Africa where apartheid has been raised to the level of a governmental policy openly applied. The many condemnations of South Africa, and universal condemnation too, have done nothing to change the attitude of the regime of Pretoria, which finds in a policy so in keeping with its racist concepts, an easy and fruitful way of ensuring increased material prosperity for the white minority.\n294.\tAs far as we Africans are concerned, this situation became worse when the regime of Ian Smith set itself up in Rhodesia. It strengthened the regime of South Africa and extended to that entire region of the continent the practices of apartheid and of racial discrimination. We are aware that the international community as a whole expressed its indignation at that rebellion, that it decided to combat it and to refuse to recognize the independence of Rhodesia until the African majority enjoyed its most legitimate rights and was able to assume its rightful role in the administration of the country. But seven years have elapsed and no satisfactory result has as yet been achieved. The Salisbury regime becomes stronger daily despite the economic sanctions adopted against it by the Security Council, and despite the efforts at negotiations with it on the part of the British Government. The latest of these efforts ended in an open failure, made public in the report of the Pearce Commission.  That report made clear the fact that the Africans in Rhodesia have a clear-cut awareness of their position and the way in which their future should be decided. If any lesson is to be drawn from these constant failures, it is that the problem of Rhodesia cannot be solved by discussions with the rebels of Salisbury, but rather by giving the African people of Zimbabwe the chance to express their views and to defend their claims. It is with their authentic representatives that their future must be discussed, and it is only with their agreement that a true solution to the problem can be found. The African countries have made proposals along these lines to the Security Council. In that other question, the culpable veto of Great Britain cannot disguise, and far less minimize, its responsibilities as an Administering Authority.\n295.\tThrough the struggles for national liberation, through the joint efforts of the independent countries of Africa in the OAU, our entire continent, with determination, is continuing its work of political and economic emancipation. But Africa is still wide open to foreign interference. The entities created by the colonial Powers to ease their withdrawal within the policy of decolonization today appear lacking and not adapted to the present situation. The systems they set up at that time could naturally be swept away in the groundswell of a youth that is aware, argumentative to an extent but insistent on what it wants, if they are not corrected and revised in time, or rather if they are not completely overhauled with serious far-sightedness, taking into account the transformation taking place and the need to re-establish relations of co-operation.\n296.\tThe failure of the third session of UNCTAD has added another reason for disillusion. This frustration is all the greater since certain problems that were considered ripe for decision in Santiago still await decision.\n297.\tOne could accept as encouraging the fact that the developing countries forced recognition of the idea of their participation in the study of a new international monetary system. But in this as in other fields, the satisfactions are more formal than true.\n298.\tSurely, we can expect nothing from a situation where the overwhelming majority of the countries are kept outside the discussions and are expected to be satisfied with acquiescing in, and suffering the consequences of, the decisions adopted in their absence and, at times, to their detriment.\n299.\tIn the same way, the right of sovereignty represented by the recovery of natural resources should not and cannot be the subject of a challenge in the disguised form of insistence on huge compensations that cancel out the advantages of nationalization. Natural resources are an integral part of the national heritage. It is clear that in many cases their nationalization must lead to equitable indemnities, yet the volume and modalities of these can be fixed only by the domestic legislation of each country. Any outside pressure, regardless of its origin, where it cannot be termed pure and simple interference in the domestic affairs of a State, nevertheless betrays the existence of a neo- colonialist effort and thereby constitutes real economic aggression that international institutions must denounce unequivocally.\n300.\tTen years ago Algeria, finally liberated, acceded to sovereignty and for the first time took its seat in this august Assembly. It came in, fully confident since it knew that here it would find precious friendships that had been forged in trials and tribulations, and because they were inspired by the same aspirations that had led the Algerian people to make so many sacrifices.\n301.\tNaturally, in the history of nations, 10 years of international life can be regarded as nothing but a beginning. Yet these 10 years have been devoted, with the same faith, with the same ardor and with the same determination, to safeguarding the ideals of justice, of freedom and of peace set forth in the Charter and to promoting the economic and political progress of the Algerian people. I do not have to dwell here on the virtues of peoples. Like all others, the Algerian people has devoted itself to a constant search for its own specific path, drawing inspiration from its national realities, and to the definition of a code of ' conduct based upon understanding and co-operation among peoples.\n302.\tHaving suffered so much from war, who better than we can appreciate the benefits of peace? Having been so long kept in colonial limbo, who better than we can be attached to national independence? Naturally you can well understand the pride of my country at being selected to act as host for the next summit conference of the non-aligned nations, and this at a time when more and more important countries of the third world are represented among them. The strengthening and constant widening of non-alignment have revealed the awakened awareness of these countries and their desire to play their part in, and bear their share of, international responsibilities. If it is true that the emergence of non-alignment resulted from the separation of the world into blocs, it is equally obvious today that that political attitude is self-defining and not only by reference to some outside yardstick. Non-alignment does not lie in the choice of one position as opposed to the centers of decision that are alien to it; that would be a static position which might be justifiable in certain circumstances, but would necessarily be subject to challenge by any change in the international balance. Non-alignment today is increasingly becoming a voluntary commitment in international action and carries within it its own potential of dynamism and effectiveness. Henceforth it defines alone of force among the components of the international system, and must enjoy participation in the creation of any stable and lasting world balance.\n303.\tWithin the United Nations, the major meeting place of all nations, and together with other non-aligned nations, Algeria will continue to seek to ensure that international institutions, far from being playthings of circumstances and of the interests of the strong, must truly and objectively reflect the concern of all peoples and bear within them the safeguards for a future of justice, of progress and of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my delegation warmly congratulates you upon your election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Not only are you eminently qualified for the task, but also you are a representative of a great country which has made valuable contributions towards international peace and security, particularly in the field of human freedom and justice. I wish to assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of your heavy responsibility.\n2.\tPermit me also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, who presided over the proceedings of the twenty-sixth session with distinction.\n3.\tAlthough I had occasion elsewhere to extend our sincere congratulations and best wishes to our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, I should like to renew those sentiments. In this connexion,' I wish to reassure him of the support and co-operation of the Government of Zambia in the performance of his very important and difficult duties.\n4.\tSignificant developments have taken place since the twenty-sixth session. Recently, foreign ministers of non-aligned countries met in Georgetown, Guyana, and it was clear from the number and level of participants that the non-aligned movement has not only grown through new membership but has also increased its commitment.\n5.\tAs I pay a tribute to the Government and people of Guyana for the Excellent organization of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Georgetown from 8 to 12 August 1972, and the warm hospitality extended to participants, it is important to stress the fact that for the first time the non-aligned nations paid special attention to areas of economic co-operation. The outcome was a program of action for economic co-operation  whose implementation should, inter alia, increase self-reliance.\n6.\tFurthermore, it was evident that the non-aligned movement was becoming increasingly determined to stamp out oppression and foreign domination in all its forms and manifestations. The movement has also shown in practical terms its resolve to support those who are fighting for human freedom. Zambia, like other Member States, is proud to belong to a movement which is committed to peace, justice and progress in the world.\n7.\tThe restoration last year of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization was both a welcome and a significant development. China has consistently supported and assisted peoples struggling for their freedom. It is committed to the cause of peace. The recent normalization of relations between China and Japan, which we warmly welcome, is but one example of the genuine efforts of China in this regard. Since its emergence in 1949, after devastating and protracted wars, the People's Republic of China has developed on the basis of self-reliance. Its experience in this respect is relevant to many developing countries.\n8.\tThe contacts of Washington with Peking and Moscow have brought some change in their relations. We welcome this trend because it brings relief to many nations of the world which, for the past quarter of a century, have been very concerned about the East-West confrontation. Indeed, we welcome also the efforts towards detente in Europe and hope that these will contribute to international peace and security in our time.\n9.\tHowever, while this change on the part of big Powers is indeed\\\" welcome, it appears to create difficulties for the United Nations in its endeavor to discover its place in this limited detente, which carries some very negative elements of military superiority and big Power monopoly in the decision-making process affecting the entire human race. It is well known that monopolistic tendencies are not only contrary to the democratization of international relations and the realization of peace, justice and progress, but also to the principles of independence and sovereignty.\n10.\tIn Georgetown, Guyana, the foreign ministers of non-aligned countries \\\"expressed their solidarity with the struggle of the heroic people of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos for their self-determination. These people had been \nsubjected to the ravages of war for decades, and had suffered incalculable losses, both human and material. But the brutal war which was being waged against the people of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos had only strengthened their will. It was heartening to note that they were continuing their struggle with renewed vigour and perseverance.\\\" \n11.\tThe escalation of the United States war in Viet-Nam, which now includes the use of F-ll jet bombers, is aggravating the already serious situation in terms of untold suffering, loss of life and property in Indo-China. This is an act of United States terrorism against the Viet-Nam people and must be condemned in the strongest terms. It must be emphasized that in South-East Asia vast areas are being laid waste by the most inhuman and unparalleled use of devastating chemical weapons and defoliants contrary to the Geneva Protocol of 1925  and to the spirit of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June of this year.\n12.\tThe United States forces must immediately stop all bombing of the innocent people of Viet-Nam. We still believe that the only basis for a just and lasting peace in South-East Asia is for the United States of America to respond to the seven-point peace plan as enunciated by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.\n13.\tTurning now to the Indian subcontinent, we commend President Bhutto and Prime Minister Gandhi for their efforts which led to the relaxation of tension, culminating on 3 July in the Simla Agreement.\n14.\tZambia has always supported the reunification of Korea. In this connexion we welcome the bilateral contacts and discussions which are aimed at creating favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of that country without outside interference.\n15.\tThe Zambia delegation wishes to pay a tribute to the 10 Members of the Committee of African heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] for their efforts to help the United Nations find a solution to the problem of the Middle East.\n16.\tIt is a fact that very many Palestinians have been displaced and are without shelter. Under these circumstances, frustration, despair and bitterness are inevitable. We should try to solve the underlying cause of the problem. Often we tend to spend much time discussing the effect instead of addressing ourselves to the cause. We want peace, security and justice for all the people in the region.\n17.\tWe believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) provides a basis for the settlement of the problem, but the self-interest of the big Powers seems to' complicate further efforts aimed at reaching a just and lasting settlement.\n18.\tThe grave situation in southern Africa and Guinea (Bissau) continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security. Both the spirit and the decisions  of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Rabat, Morocco, from 12 to 15 June 1972, demonstrate that the people of Africa are resolved to free every inch of their continent from foreign domination. The oppressed people fighting for their freedom are entitled to support from the international community to enable them to achieve their total liberation. In the non-aligned movement this support is already assured, as was once again demonstrated at the Gerogetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries.\n19.\tSince my address to this Assembly last year [1945th meeting] the liberation movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) have continued to gain ground in their struggle for freedom. The liberated areas have been visited by groups of people and individuals and given support from different parts of the world. We are also aware of the experiences of the three-man Special Mission of the United Nations which visited Guinea (Bissau) last April, spending a total of 130 hours inside the liberated areas of that Territory without finding any evidence of Portuguese administration or control. Portugal must accept its defeat in these areas.\n20.\tIt is disquieting to note that some Western countries continue to make available to Portugal chemical means of warfare which are used against the African people in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Besides committing acts of genocide, fascist Portugal continues to use defoliants on cassava, sweet potatoes and other crops in many of the inhabited areas, resulting in total destruction of food crops. This has brought about serious famine in the areas affected. This kind of savagery and irresponsibility by Portugal should be condemned. Appropriate measures should be taken by the countries which supply Portugal with these weapons to ensure that it does not acquire and use them.\n21.\tI therefore wish to appeal to all peace-loving nations to increase their moral and material assistance to the liberation movements in these Territories. I am aware that a number of countries have given, and continue to give, considerable material assistance to these movements. To them I express Zambia's sincere appreciation. However, there are other countries which have thrown overboard all the principles and ethics upon which they molded their own nationhood. They have instead clung to policies of self-interest and inhumanity by aiding the forces of colonialism and racism in Africa.\n22.\tI now wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to another aspect of the liberation struggle in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). I mentioned earlier that large areas of these Territories have been liberated and are under the complete control of the liberation movements. In those areas the life of the people must continue to be sustained. These people need, and must have, adequate food, health and educational services. They also require transport facilities to ensure the effective distribution of supplies in those areas.\n23.\tI am convinced that in this field the specialized agencies of the United Nations not only have the capacity to provide these services to the liberated areas but they have an urgent and moral obligation to provide the required assistance in accordance v ;th General Assembly resolution 2874 (XXVI) and other relevant resolutions. These areas are administered as autonomous units and accordingly ought to be offered multilateral assistance by specialized agencies. For the purposes of assistance, these areas should be considered to be least developed among the developing countries, as defined by the Committee for Development Planning of the Economic and Social Council  and should, therefore, be eligible for the special measures envisaged in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n24.\tThe problem of rule by the racist illegal minority in Zimbabwe remains one which preoccupies the United Nations and the international community as a whole. I expressed the views of my delegation on this pressing question in my statement to the Security Council on Wednesday, 27 September 1972.  I should like, however, to repeat my call to the British Government to convene without delay a constitutional conference at which all sections of the people of Zimbabwe would freely express their views on the kind of government they would desire for their country. My Government will continue to support the people of Zimbabwe in their just struggle to achieve self-determination and independence on the basis of majority rule.\n25.\tThe question of Namibia continues to pose a serious challenge to the authority of the United Nations, which is directly responsible for the administration of that Territory. The grave situation created by South Africa's continued illegal occupation of that Territory demands that urgent and effective measures be taken by the Organization, and in particular by the Security Council, to end the illegal occupation forthwith.\n26.\tWe strongly condemn the Fascist and racist regime in Pretoria for its extension of the obnoxious policy of apartheid to Nambia and for the balkanization of that Territory. We are aware that South Africa's continued defiance of the Organization's decisions and resolutions has been sustained by the support of certain Western countries which have vested economic and other interests in Namibia. We condemn all these countries which continue to support and protect the South African racists. Zambia will continue to render assistance to the people of Namibia in the struggle for their self-determination and independence as a unitary State.\n27.\tA great deal of literature and information on the evils of apartheid has been made available through various news media to the world community. At the twenty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted a very comprehensive resolution-resolution 2775 (XXVI)-on apartheid, which not only is a crime against humanity but also cuts across the very fabric of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore I wish to echo the appeal that has been made from time to time to implement the various Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the elimination of apartheid. In this connexion my delegation welcomes the draft program for a decade for action to combat racism and racial discrimination presented by the Secretary-General under resolutions 2784 (XXVI) and 2785 (XXVI)[A/8805, annex],\n28.\tZambia supports fully the proposed program for the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted on 10 December 1948 by this Assembly [A/8820]. In marking this anniversary, the United Nations should consider taking effective measures against the minority racist and oppressive regime in Africa and other parts of the world which continue to violate the articles of this important document.\n29.\tI should now like to address myself to another disturbing matter which is perhaps the main factor delaying the attainment of complete self-determination and independence in Africa. I refer to the economic and military involvement of certain Western countries in areas of Africa where the indigenous people are still striving for their independence. The United States importation of chrome from Rhodesia is one of the most flagrant violations by a Member of this Organization. The action is not based on the needs of the United States for chrome, as was pointed out by my colleagues the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Sudan and the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Kenya during the Security Council debate on Rhodesia on 28 September.  The decision has undoubtedly frustrated and considerably weakened efforts to combat racism and illegal minority rule in Southern Rhodesia.\n30.\tThere are other Western countries, particularly the United Kingdom and France, which continue to sell arms to South Africa. We deplore this contravention of Security Council resolutions on the arms embargo. In this connexion, my Government has on previous occasions also spoken out against similar activities by a number of other Western countries. All these retrogressive acts must stand condemned in the strongest terms by this Organization.\n31.\tIn this respect I want to pay a tribute to individuals and organizations in some Western countries that have recognized the justification and the legitimacy of the struggle taking place in Africa and are doing everything possible to influence their Governments to cease these callous acts. To them I offer my appreciation and every encouragement.\n32.\tIt is particularly disquieting to note that the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ, held in Santiago, Chile, in April and May of this year, did not bring about any significant openings in the field of trade. Resolutions were passed in the hope that they would contribute to the economic development of the developing countries. Time and again resolutions presented by the Group of 77 developing countries were either watered down beyond recognition or rejected outright by the developed countries. That kind of attitude should not be allowed to persist. In the presence of political goodwill, no obstacle is insurmountable.\n33.\tIt must be pointed out, however, that the non-aligned countries and other developing countries are aware that the prime responsibility for their economic development rests with them. Accordingly, at the Georgetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, an action program for economic co-operation among non-aligned countries was drawn up. The measures included in the program are many and cover fields such as trade, finance, investment, research, the transfer of technology and institutional arrangements for economic co-operation and co-ordination. The purpose of the action plan is to strengthen the non-aligned movement economically and raise the standard of living of its members.\n34.\tGeneral and complete disarmament under effective international control remains the most imperative and urgent need of our time. the disheartening arms race is still far from being controlled. It is a major contribution to mounting tension in various parts of the world and it certainly is inimical to international peace and security. Needless to say, the development and the production of nuclear weapons threaten the existence of man and his environment.\n35.\tIt is in the light of this grave situation that we must act quickly, not only to halt the senseless and wasteful arms race but also to Catty out measures for the complete destruction of the weapons of war already in the arsenals of States. If we genuinely want peace for ourselves and for future generations, we have no excuse for not providing its only irUe guarantee: general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\n36.\tThe position of Zambia and other non-aligned countries is reflected in clear terms in the Lusaka Declaration and more recently in the Statement on International Security and Disarmament adopted by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries and issued in Georgetown, Guyana, in August 1972. We take note of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826(XXVI)i annexJ. However, Zambia would like to see concluded as Soon as possible a convention on the total prohibition of chemical weapons and their elimination from the arsenals; of States. While we welcome the recent partial agreement reached between the United States and the USSR of the limitation of strategic arms,  we note with regret that the agreement does not include any limitation of qualitative improvements in the nuclear weapons of the two Powers. We would like to see the early elimination of all nuclear stockpiles in the world.\n37.\tSince matters of international security affect all of us, we strongly believe that all nations of the world should participate fully in the discussion of such matters. We therefore welcome the proposal to convene a World Disarmament Conference, at which we hope all States, nuclear and non-nuclear, will participate as equals. In our view, the basic aim of that conference should be to make a positive effort to achieve progress toward general and complete disarmament, and primarily towards the banning and destruction of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.\n38.\tI should like to refer to the lack of effective international law governing the seas, which cover approximately three-quarters of this planet. At present, technologically advanced countries are engaged in eroding the freedom of the seas by making dangerous incursions into ocean space and thereby threatening freedom of navigation, depleting marine life and causing pollution. Land-locked countries have a particular and special interest in sharing in the exploitation of the riches of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, considering that they are excluded from participation in the exploitation of the living resources of the sea, not only in territorial waters but also in adjacent waters and fishing zones, and have no access to the wealth of the continental shelf.\n39.\tOn the vitally important question of transit and free access to the sea, we believe that this right should be embodied in the international instrument which may result from the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea.\n40.\tSpecialized agencies, such as the ILO, FAO, UNESCO, UNICEF, WHO and UNIDO, have greatly assisted the developing countries in their particular fields of operations. The adoption in 1970 of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade made the role of the regional economic commissions and the specialized agencies even more important; and as their funds depend mainly on voluntary contributions, the international community should give generously to enable them to fulfill their duties efficiently.\n41.\tWe are, however, aware of the growing crisis of confidence in the ability and authority of the United Nations to deal effectively with pressing international problems such as the achievement of human freedom and independence. That crisis of confidence arises out of the frustration and despair of the international community.\n42.\tThe Government of the Republic of Zambia shares the concern and the view that there is a great and urgent need for change in the attitude of the super-Powers and for restructuring the Organization in order to meet the demands of the changed situation. In this connexion, we are convinced that the tendency on the part of the superPowers to by-pass the United Nations in dealing with some problems of vital importance and interest to the whole of the international community has the continued effect of eroding the prestige and the authority of the Organization.\n43.\tIt is imperative that the principle of. equality of membership and of equitable geographical representation be applied. In this regard, the Security Council, as the main organ charged with the responsibility of maintaining peace and security, needs to be changed. It must cease to be a preserve of the big Powers where they can use their power of veto at will in order to protect their interests and those of their allies. Only last week the representative of the United Kingdom cast a negative vote in the Security Council in defense of the illegal racist regime in Southern Rhodesia. The Security Council must be transformed into a body that will truly reflect the changed circumstances. To that end, one wonders whether the criteria for eligibility for new permanent membership in the future should not be reviewed so as to ensure that they are based, not on military or economic power, but rather on the principle of equitable geographical representation. In any case, the developing countries make a significant contribution towards the economic well-being of some permanent members of the Security Council. Also we do not agree that economic might necessarily reflects sound political morality. We submit that there is a great need to increase the present number of permanent members to enable other geographical regions to be represented on the Council.\n44.\tIn the meantime, we are convinced of the urgent need for taking appropriate measures aimed at eliminating the veto or at least its misuse. It is disturbing that the Organization, comprising 132 Member States, can allow itself to be rendered impotent in the discharge of its solemn duty by the use of the veto in the Security Council by one permanent Member State, regardless of the gravity of the situation involved.\n45.\tIn conclusion I wish to reaffirm Zambia's support for the United Nations and our commitment to support any efforts designed to strengthen it. I earnestly hope that this Organization will continue to foster co-operation in the international community and to further the cause of human freedom, peace and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in addressing this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly I am very happy to offer you the heartiest congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of this august Assembly. Your unanimous choice was not only a just recognition of your great personal qualities but also a tribute to the country of great diplomatic and other traditions which you represent. We are confident that under your enlightened guidance, and I would say thanks to it, the present session will fulfill the hopes which the peoples we represent have placed in us.\n45.\tI should like also to express to the Secretary-General, Kurt Waldheim, our great esteem for the outstanding job he has already done for the Organization. During this first year of his mandate the Secretary-General has been endlessly active in all United Nations fields and we can only congratulate him on the positive results which he has already achieved in so short a space of time. He has taken over the direction of the Secretariat at a crucial moment for the Organization and it is certainly appropriate that he should consider the re-establishment of the authority and the prestige of the United Nations as one of the primary objectives to be attained. It goes without saying that this task does not concern the Secretary-General alone; it is of primary interest to each of the sovereign countries which make up the United Nations, and it is only ever more complete and open collaboration among all the Member States which can give the Organization its proper place in the world.\n46.\tOur Organization has reached an important crossroads in its history. The participation of the People's Republic of China represents a major landmark on the road to universality, and it is precisely because I want to see us persevere on this road that I hope for the speedy admission of Bangladesh. The entry of that State into the United Nations would be the logical consequence and the complete and sincere application of the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972.\n47.\tIn our view a difficult hurdle to clear in the interest of ensuring universality is the admission of the divided States of Europe and Asia. However, I must say that I am optimistic following the encouraging developments in Germany which I hope will make it possible to bring about the. normalization of relations between the two German States and, in consequence, their simultaneous admission to the United Nations.\n48.\tI also note with satisfaction that contacts have been established between North and South Korea, and for my part I am convinced that here again common sense will triumph and the parties concerned will find a settlement which will take due account of the essential interests of the Korean people as a whole. In such circumstances that is, whenever the parties are themselves moving in the direction desired by all our Assembly must refrain from a debate which might arouse too many passions and arguments drawn from the past at a time when a page of history is about to be turned and preparations are being made for the future.\n49.\tIf one considers the present international situation other developments which seem to us to be encouraging cannot fail to be noted. The most striking event in this respect seems to me to be the detente which has appeared in the relations between the United States of America and both the Soviet Union and China. We must rejoice to see the leaders of the great Powers giving ever greater priority to dialog and to the search for common grounds of agreement and co-operation. Our international community as a whole welcomes this desire to avoid as far as possible confrontations which are too often due to considerations of prestige and power and to the desire to settle their disputes peacefully.\n50.\tThis climate of detente and co-operation has already made possible considerable progress towards a return to a normal situation in the heart of Europe thanks to the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and to the considerable improvement in relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. Similarly, the ratification of treaties prohibiting the use of force between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union on the one hand and the Federal Republic of Germany and your country, Mr. President, on the other, augur well for the conference on security and co-operation in Europe, the preparatory work for which is to begin shortly in Helsinki.\n51.\tAs the representative of a very small European country which twice in the twentieth century suffered terribly from confrontations between its great neighbors, I am particularly happy that there are new prospects for Europe to be entirely peaceful, turned towards cooperation and, indeed towards competition in the economic, social and cultural fields, but at last with no further recourse to force or even to the threat of force.\n52.\tWhile I can at last express my satisfaction at the positive development in what is traditionally called East- West relations, I am, however, particularly sorry to note the persistence of serious conflicts which take the form of open or threatened hostilities in Viet-Nam and in the Middle East, in spite of all the efforts to bring about peace which have indeed already resulted in a substantial withdrawal of military forces and military experts.\n53.\tAs regards the Vietnamese conflict, the slow pace of the Paris negotiations must cause despair to a people that has endured the ravages of war for more than 30 years and whose country is slowly undergoing total destruction. I express the profound hope that efforts towards an equitable peace will no longer be held back by considerations of tactics and prestige and that each party will at least scrupulously respect the rules of war and simple humanity, both in regard to prisoners of war and to the prohibition against striking civilian targets and endangering the lives of civilians.\n54.\tAnother trouble spot in the world with respect to which our Organization has, regrettably, thus far displayed almost total impotence is the conflict in the Middle East. Innumerable hours of debate in the General Assembly and the Security Council and numerous resolutions have been devoted to various aspects of this dismaying problem without, as must be acknowledged, any solution having really come closer. My Government remains convinced that the basis for a settlement remains the principles set out in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and here, again, I can only subscribe to everything that Minister Harmel said from this rostrum this morning [2054th meeting] which must finally be implemented either totally or, if that is not possible, at least step by step.\n55.\tOn the contrary, we see, unfortunately, on the one hand the Arab States refusing to negotiate and adhering to an attitude that leaves no way out, an attitude of \\\"all or nothing\\\", instead of recognizing that everywhere in the world only negotiation has made it possible to achieve solutions to conflicts. And on the other hand we see Israel, for its part, deliberately or through the simple passage of time, daily consolidating its position in the occupied territories. Negotiations, direct or indirect because we are all anxious to spare the susceptibilities of all the parties concerned seem to me to be an elementary course, and probably the only course, to reach a valid compromise. Those who oppose negotiations must seek inspiration from other recent experiences of the great Powers which I have already mentioned-and derive confidence from the dynamism of negotiations. To wish to get the last possible concession before actually negotiating is an attitude which is, in my estimation and on the basis of history, unrealistic. Organizations such as ours-through the intermediary, for instance, of the mediator Mr. Jarring, in whom my Government again expresses its confidence -and States or groups of States may make suggestions for a settlement or offer their good offices in order to bring the parties together; but the principal responsibility remains and will always remain that of those parties.\n56.\tThe events of past weeks, the terrorist attacks and the reprisals offer little room for optimism. The Government of Luxembourg condemns terrorism in all its forms and deplores the innocent victims that it has produced. I was in Munich at the time of the massacre in September and I was horrified by the violence inflicted upon innocent victims. We are therefore prepared for our part to associate ourselves with all actions that may be undertaken to repress terrorism, be that here or in any other, more restricted context. We are convinced that only determined action by all the nations can bear fruit, just as we are convinced that that solidarity is in the interest of all the Member States.\n57.\tI must add that my Government condemns equally vigorously blind reprisals which produce innocent victims. Moral law must always prevail over so-called requirements of security and must prohibit the taking of the smallest risk that one will miss the target and kill even one innocent person.\n58.\tTerrorism and reprisals are a vicious circle which has a chance of being broken only if an over-all settlement of the problem of the Middle East is reached, a settlement which must, of course, extend to the Palestine refugees-and I have constantly repeated that it is dangerous and wrong to neglect or underestimate this aspect of the problem. This pessimism which the situation has inspired in me and in many others should be a stimulant to action, not a brake on it.\n59.\tThe serious events to which I have just referred-be they encouraging or depressing-have this in common: they highlight the very small influence exercised in the past or being exercised at present by the United Nations. We are bound to acknowledge that there is still a very difficult road ahead in regard to bringing about international security through the adoption of effective collective measures for the purpose of preventing or removing threats to peace, repressing acts of aggression and reaching a peaceful settlement of disputes or situations which might lead to conflicts.\n60.\tOf course, progress has already been made in the limitation of arms by virtue of international treaties which prohibit certain forms of nuclear tests and limit the production of certain types of nuclear or biological weapons, especially on the bilateral level, where the United States and the Soviet Union have concluded the first treaty whose purpose is to limit the production and the use of certain strategic arms.\n61.\tBut we are also bound to note that more than 10 years of negotiation in the field of disarmament have produced only extremely modest results if one recalls that since 1960 more than $2 million million has been used for the manufacture of all sorts of war material. It is therefore essential to adopt political decisions internationally in order to modify the situation and to make it possible at last to make available for peaceful purposes the extraordinary resources that might thus be liberated.\n62.\tI should also like to express the hope that the work that has been going on for many years to give peace-keeping operations a more solid basis will soon be crowned with success. Public opinion in our countries can no longer understand why a program for the use of forces in the service of peace cannot be concluded after such lengthy discussions and such important negotiations.\n63.\tThe general mission of a world organization encompassing more than 130 sovereign countries becomes increasingly more complex and difficult for a multitude of reasons. Improvements in the means of transport and communication, the development of industrial, commercial and financial networks throughout the world and the continuing progress of science and technology are such that States are becoming ever-more interdependent notwithstanding their sovereignty. This means that an increasing number of problems can no longer be solved within a strictly national context and, accordingly, international organizations have been given, and will increasingly be given, new tasks.\n64.\tIt is evident that the machinery for international and multinational co-operation is not sufficiently perfected to permit of the immediate solution of all these problems at the world level. Certain problems, as must be recognized, have become particularly acute on a regional plane, and it is frequently easier to arrive, at least in the first stage, at valid solutions applicable in a restricted area before extending or generalizing the solution on a world-wide basis.\n65.\tIt is in that light that for decades my country has been taking part in all efforts at co-operation and integration capable not only of bringing about economic progress but also of guaranteeing more stability for our own continent. Beginning with the Union economique belgo-luxembourgeoise and including the Benelux Economic Union, we have from the very first taken part in the building of integrated Europe.\n66.\tThe meeting of the heads of State and Government of the nine countries of the expanded European Economic Community, which will take place in Paris in two weeks, will, I hope, lay down the essential guide-lines for the future of the Community and will, I am sure, give a decisive impetus towards increasing unification which can never be synonymous in our minds with falling back upon oneself, but, on the contrary, means opening towards the outside world. If Europe is to have greater weight, it will have to shoulder even more clearly its responsibility, first vis-a-vis the developing countries, but also vis-a-vis other industrialized countries. A Community which is the greatest commercial power in the world, even if it is not the least fragile, has the right, indeed the duty, to affirm its own identity and to deal on a footing of equality with the other industrialized States concerning economic, commercial and monetary problems without there being any question of any prior conditions either way, and this with the sole purpose of reaching settlements satisfactory to all the countries concerned.\n67.\tSuch a Community has the special duty to take the greatest account of the needs of all the countries of the third world and most especially of those who have been our partners from the very first.\n68.\tThe third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTAD], held in the spring in Santiago, Chile, did not, unfortunately, live up to expectations. But is it not true that public opinion sometimes tends to expect too much from great conferences of this kind? After all, the achievement of tangible results in a field so complex and controversial requires persevering and continuous co-operation based upon a common political will. Moreover, I feel that what harmed that session of UNCTAD was that an attempt was made to discuss and resolve every tiling simultaneously.\n69.\tNevertheless, it would be unfair to minimize the results obtained at that session, which recognized the need to have the developing countries participate in the rearrangement of the international monetary system and to devote special attention to aid to the least developed countries. The session likewise made possible a better understanding of highly varied problems posed by development. Now, we have to implement the decisions adopted, to infuse the will to act and to offer the means to do so to the United Nations organizations concerned, as well as to all the other institutions which, both nationally and internationally, are dealing with developmental problems.\n70.\tThe countries of the European Community will no longer be able to take refuge behind the absence of world-wide solutions in order not to move forward, but they will not accept criticism concerning the regionalism of their aid on the part of those that stick solely to bilateral aid.\n71.\tIn regard to the environment, over and above national issues there are the needs of mankind which transcend the borders of States and require rational international cooperation on a world-wide basis. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to avoid having the just preoccupation with the future of mankind on earth hide from us present injustices and disorder. The setting of priorities for action to be taken will have to be such as to weigh carefully all the problems to be resolved. This is one of the primary tasks of the present session of the Assembly to point the way. Here I can only say that I applaud what my colleague and friend, Mr. Schmelzer, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, has said on this subject [2050th meeting].\n72.\tIt might also be appropriate to add to these considerations on under-development and the protection of environment a few brief reflections on this intellectual and moral pollution caused by racial discrimination as it exists today. It ought to be clear to any man of good sense that, while there may be characteristics peculiar to every race, no race is superior to any other, and therefore there is no justification for separation or segregation by force, which is nothing but a manifestation of the arrogance of certain human beings vis-a-vis other human beings whom they consider inferior.\n73.\tIn this respect Europe is frequently judged to be privileged, because, it would appear to have a more homogeneous population and is therefore free from any racial problems. This is only partly true. Luxembourg, for instance, has within its borders a foreign population by birth amounting to 30 per cent of its own population. It is unquestionable that such a situation, by virtue of the differences of language, custom and habit and mores, creates genuine problems in the relations between foreign immigrants and Luxembourgers. Hence even we are perfectly capable of appreciating the difficulties which countries with multiracial populations may be confronted with, but that makes us only more convinced that these difficulties cannot be resolved except through co-operation based upon reciprocal good will and upon extensive understanding, whereas any discrimination will have only the effect of creating tension, indeed hatred, which nothing will dispel but which the slightest thing can cause to explode.\n74.\tI am bound to add that while my comments apply, of course, to southern Africa, I condemn with the same rigor discrimination which emerges in any other country, and in particular the brutal expulsion brutal both in its conception and its execution of persons of different ethnic origins from any country in the world.\n75.\tOver the years we have all had to contend with numerous criticisms of the United Nations, especially by the press and world public opinion, which describe our Organization in terms that are frequently less than kind.\n76.\tEven if there is considerable exaggeration in all these assertions, we nevertheless must recognize that some of the aspects of the work of the United Nations are open to criticism, and it is of course necessary to reconsider the procedures, which are sometimes too slow or cumbersome, in order to arrive at more suitable working methods. I consider in particular that we ought to adhere more to a sound distribution of work and not introduce in technical debates questions of a political order, which, of course, all countries are keenly interested in but which should instead be discussed by highly competent persons, in a context that should be reserved for such discussions.\n77.\tSome have expressed the opinion that the Charter, signed more than 27 years ago in San Francisco, is now obsolete and no longer constitutes a valid basis for world-wide co-operation. On the contrary, we, together with many Governments represented here, are of the opinion that the Charter, although not a perfect instrument, nevertheless remains one that is very well suited to its purposes, and while it is not something that should not remain untouchable or untouched, at this stage there is no need to make any fundamental changes in it.\n78.\tIf international co-operation in the United Nations is not always as effective as it might be, the fault, let us recognize, lies not with the Charter and this must be recalled very often but rather with the very imperfect use made of it by Member States.\n79.\tI express the hope that the present session of the Assembly will be conducted in a climate of forthrightness and confident and dispassionate co-operation, and therefore in a climate of mutual respect, without which fruitful work cannot be done, so that we may not disappoint the just hopes of the peoples of the whole world.\n"

        "file_text": "My country is once again attending the General Assembly in the same spirit of co-operation and hope as has always prompted us in regard to the vast objectives the world Organization is called upon to fulfill. I should like to express first of all my congratulations on the wise election to the presidency of the Assembly of the representative of Poland, whose eminent qualifications and dedication to the cause of the international Organization give us a complete guarantee of his conduct in such a prominent post.\n97.\tThe present session enables us to renew the periodic analysis of the status of the compliance or response of the United Nations in regard to the complex problems which have arisen in our community.\n98.\tIn my opinion, important progress has been achieved despite the recognized shortcomings of a system which has not yet reached the desired affirmation of a new international order. Nevertheless, none can fail to recognize that in the 27 years of the existence of the Organization we have witnessed a forward movement of a universal concert of the most varied tendencies, marching towards the erection of a global structure of mankind, bringing closer communications and closer political and social interactions among peoples, without the abandonment by those peoples of their special characteristics, whether of culture, religion, race or otherwise. This enables us to understand the difficulties for an Organization which has not yet achieved its full development in fulfilling the main purposes which led to its establishment.\n99.\tUruguay had the privilege of being part of the original group of the United Nations and at San Francisco we accepted the reality of the great Powers, which were largely entrusted with the maintenance of peace, so that by this means they could facilitate social progress and the raising of the standard of living of all peoples and respect for the obligations flowing from treaties and other sources of international law.\n100.\tConfronted with the picture now before us in 1972, we find a fact which is up to a point encouraging in ensuring that responsibility of the great Powers for peace. Obviously there has been progress, since there has been a lessening of tension between the great Powers. Together with the universality we have approached with the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, we also have observed better prospects in the relations between the permanent members of the Security Council, in such a way that we can think that increasingly any idea of a third world war or of a conflict which would threaten the existence of our planet is being further removed.\n101.\tThe Secretary-General of the United Nations has just affirmed that \\\"the process of detente among the great Powers is certainly a historic event of the highest importance\\\" [A/8701fAdd.1, p. 1]. This fact has led to what has been called a \\\"balance of prudence\\\" and permits us to hope for better results in the not-too-distant future. Despite these encouraging circumstances in which understanding and negotiations have begun in areas in which before they only moved within an atmosphere of confrontation, it has not yet been possible to eliminate conflicts which entail military hostilities, with great human losses, serious destruction and innocent victims, because of acts of violence and uncontrolled aggression. It has become obvious that the United Nations has not been able to put an end to or resolve these situations which have so gravely threatened peace and which in some cases have unleashed actual armed conflicts, which we still witness with grief, because of the powerlessness of the means called upon to maintain peace and security, indeed the principal objective of our Organization.\n102.\tIt would be unfair not to recognize the position in the world with regard to colonial liberation, which is a primary task of the United Nations. The history of mankind has accelerated dramatically in recent years in a direction favorable to mankind. The liberation which has been achieved is an admirable success of this Organization, which has been able to overcome the barriers of despotism and the scourge of colonial exploitation as part of an effort of immense courage and social redemption, which makes it possible to see many peoples now among the free nations after a lengthy period of decolonization. As a citizen of Uruguay I observe the often tragic history of the independence of our countries of Latin America, with constellations of glorious deeds and warlike struggles, and I think that we did not have this tremendous accelerating drive which in recent times has been the decisive work of our community in action. This has created an international conscience which fights more effectively than armies themselves in those areas where complete liberation has not been attained and where barbarism and oppression still reign. We have worked out new formulas to resolve injustice and imbalance among the nations, applying to international life the inspired concept of complete equality of rights for all human beings. That is the task which our Organization has started in order to bring closer together nations which at times remained apart because of external influences or hegemonies, or for other sterile motives, nations which we now see coming together under the imperative course of history, compelling us to bring justice and well-being to all the areas of the world, which today we see united into a single territory destined for development and universal progress. The rate of these conquests is still slow, but they proceed inexorably.\n103.\tWe consider the initiation of contacts between governments such as those of South and North Korea to be auspicious and we predict fruitful results from these initial understandings, as well as from those between the two German States, which have been able to find a more favorable path towards a rapprochement. The Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 between India and Pakistan can also be mentioned as an event full of good prospects capable of permitting a permanent peace between those great nations of Asia. With regard to the Middle East, we are saddened by the repetition of events which prevent the consolidation of a state of peace for the region, which in our opinion could only be achieved by the complete application of all the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n104.\tOur country maintains excellent relations with the Arab States and with the State of Israel and tries to maintain an impartial position which will permit it, as a Member of the United Nations, to do its utmost to co-operate towards a conciliation which is becoming increasingly urgent and necessary. Uruguay has distinguished groups and contingents of Arabs and Jews in its territory and has also received members of other communities, such as the Armenians, who have found protection and shelter with us as host country and as a free refuge for immigrants, the \u2022 dispossessed and the exiles of the world. These communities have become bulwarks of civilization and progress in our midst and live together peacefully. Today they enjoy full citizenship, and we want justice and well-being for all, while respecting the traditions of their countries of origin. It is to be hoped that as negotiations and dialogs go on in other areas of the world it will also be possible to open up similar prospects in the Middle East between States and peoples which are today separated and which history has called upon to live together as good neighbors and to co-operate in progress not only in that area but in the world as a whole.\n105.\tWe cannot fail to mention the burning issues related to the still existing colonialism and the conditions which the African nations consider to be essential to complete the total liberation of their continent.\n106.\tOur country has played an important role in the process of decolonization. We were members of, and presided over, the former Committee on South West Africa and we were members of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples from its establishment and for seven years. In all forums Uruguay has advocated greater speed in meeting the task of contributing to the achievement of independence by all those territories.\n107.\tWe do not abdicate today our position of yesterday when we point out that the work which remains can only be carried out with respect for the principles of our Charter and its standards, since these achievements will be final only when they bear the imprint of international law. The path of international law and justice is at times a painful one, but it is increasingly less slow, as is proved by the presence here of so many sovereign nations; but it is the only course we can follow to put an end to colonial domination and discrimination of any kind whatsoever.\n108.\tAs regards natural resources and the law of the sea, we have reached a point at which the imperatives of technology, science and conservation itself may come into conflict with archaic concepts and the most deep-rooted nationalism. We must find a way to build a world in harmony with these new realities. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June 1972, proved to us the urgency with which we must set out to resolve these pressing problems.\n109.\tA new law of the sea is the most important event in this field and a growing number of States have extended their maritime jurisdiction with the object of preserving and making better use of those vast areas for the benefit of their peoples, for whom they are often the primary source of survival. A large number of countries of Latin America favor an extension of their territorial waters to 200 miles. In this field significant progress is being made in finding criteria which will make it possible to present a common front, whatever the name given to the territorial sea: economic sea, or patrimonial sea, or zone of conservation of the species or of the right to fisheries.\n110.\tAt the. same time that we hope to arrive at satisfactory solutions in this field we recognize also the importance of establishing a regime for the sea-bed and the breadth of the territorial sea* The Declaration of Principles adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session [resolution 2749 (XXV)] is of outstanding importance in that it establishes the principles that are to govern the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof. In that resolution the United Nations has declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, together with the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor, are the common heritage of mankind. In this sense, no State may claim or exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over any part whatsoever of the oceanic area. We hope that the conference on the law of the sea that is to be convened next year will be able to consider these specific points and that it will succeed in offering solutions that will take into account the fundamental interests of all countries not only the coastal countries that are to benefit by the international regime that is to be established.\n111.\tThe problems of the human environment and the results of the Stockholm Conference will undoubtedly call for special attention from the present session of the General Assembly.\n112.\tIt cannot be denied that modern civilization has had as its consequence, in addition to inestimable progress, serious shifts in natural ecology, alterations in the environment and the indiscriminate exploitation of the flora and fauna of the earth, as well as the grave harm done through air pollution.\n113.\tThe Latin American Regional Seminar on problems of the Human Environment and Development, held in Mexico City in September of last year, established that the principal source of environmental' pollution and the pollution of water, land and sea on the international level must be attributed principally to the activities and policies of the developed countries.\n114.\tThe problems of human environment and development undoubtedly reveal differences among the industrialized States and those in the process of development. Therefore, action intended to preserve a sound ecological balance will require international co-operation in the sense of a general mobilization involving specific solutions for each region, so as to promote material development and the greatest possible prosperity for humanity in all parts of the earth.\n115.\tTurning to the matter of international economy and trade, the Second United Nations Development Decade has not shown any success in the effective fulfillment of its programs, but there do exist encouraging signs in the co-operation between prosperous nations and those in the process of development.\n116.\tThe third session of UNCTAD, held in Santiago, Chile, last April and May, produced no concrete results in some very sensitive areas, but it did nevertheless represent a step forward and it emphasized the need for rapidly finding suitable functional means for reducing the existing imbalance. In the field of international trade, some results have been achieved that must be supplemented by increasing assistance from the world institutions of credit and financing. Only through the effective utilization of the resources of the developing countries and the transformation and expansion of units of production, together with the required transfer of technology, can an acceptable economic balance be achieved.\n117.\tWe wish, further, to repeat our most resolute support for special consideration of the international monetary situation. In particular, and in connexion with the Inter-national Monetary Fund, it seems to us that the time has come to make its procedures more flexible, adjusting them in clearer fashion to the specific conditions of the member countries.\n118.\tWe agree with the position maintained by the developing countries, which have affirmed their vital interests and their full right to participate in most active fashion in all aspects connected with reform of the international monetary system. Likewise, we believe that, when the reform is carried out, special consideration must be given to the fact that it should facilitate additional aid for development and should not represent simply an instrument for consolidating the situation at present prevailing.\n119.\tThe Government of Uruguay firmly supports the initiative of the Secretary-General in submitting to this General Assembly a request for the consideration of the problem of terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l] with a view to having it adopt effective measures for the prevention and repression of terrorist acts. I should like to recall that, at the last session of the General Assembly, on behalf of my country I submitted a working paper concerning the question  which contained a draft convention for consideration by the International Law Commission to ensure that the problem would be considered at this session of the Assembly. On that occasion I stated to the Assembly the following:\n\\\"In addition to the many different forms of social disturbance which have occurred in various countries and have affected a large number of members of the inter-national community, there has been a widespread increase in violence, crime, thefts and hijackings.\\\" [1941st meeting, para. 129.]\nRecently occurring events in various parts of the world demonstrate how urgent it is that this matter be dealt with so that international action may be taken to defend the community from the continually occurring crimes afflicting it.\n120.\tInternational terrorism has taken on an extraordinary virulence in recent days, and this crime, in all its varied forms, assailing as it does the values consecrated by the civilized conscience and attacking innocent victims in absolutely cold blood, constitutes a constant terror which the international community cannot disregard, and the latter must therefore react in defense of the peace and tranquility of all peoples.\n121.\tWhen I raised this item last year, I stated that Uruguay had, in this regard, lived through an experience unique in its history [ibid.]. I added that, to the challenge thrown in its face, our country responded with all the vigor of its free institutions, with full adherence to its constitutional standards and with the election of its leaders, held at the regular times specified by its constitution, and accompanied by broad and free election campaigning amid the full exercise of its parliamentary procedures and the absolute authority of its institutions of justice [ibid., para. 130]. The doctrine governing Uruguay in the face of violence was that of strengthening law and the rule of law.\n122.\tTo us, the answer to violence must be the firm application of the law. In that connexion, we approve the idea of agreeing on an international convention to establish positive applicable provisions for preventing, or applying\n. sanctions to, crimes of terrorism in their various manifestations.\n123.\tWe cannot accept terrorist methods as a legitimate weapon of political action. In this connexion the people of my country, in the last elections which were held at the end of last year, showed its total repudiation of such methods and firmly supported democratic institutions and the consolidation of its institutional life, which had been gravely threatened. Those circumstances enabled President Bordaberry, shortly after taking power, to arrive at a national agreement between the traditional political parties and immediately and emphatically to start the struggle against violence. President Bordaberry said that the confrontation with that state of subversion was difficult because of the absence of legal texts which would have authorized the Government to undertake really effective action. He added that in our opinion, it is essential that the political parties should reach agreement to alter the existing legal texts in such a way that, while respecting individual rights-and it could not be otherwise-the public power would be enabled effectively to deal with the situations which it was facing.\n124.\tThat is the contribution which Uruguay, within its limited resources, has been able to make in the defense of human values and the legal and social order, when it is confronted with crimes of violence.\n125.\tWe hope that the results of the studies and the resolutions which will be adopted on the basis of the drafts submitted will make it possible to take positive steps in the defense of man and his fundamental rights, which constitute the high goals my country has fought for throughout its history. Those are the same purposes and principles established by the Charter of the United Nations to ensure peace throughout the world, and we are at the service of these purposes and principles of our world Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Afghan delegation, I should like to extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that the present session will, under your able leadership, witness significant steps toward finding solutions to many of the problems confronting human society.\n2. We should also like to express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, for his able handling of the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My colleagues and I also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the energy and perception with which, since his election to the post of Secretary-General, he has embarked upon the manifold\nduties and heavy responsibilities of this highly esteemed office. \n3. In the changing world of today, with problems increasing\nboth in number and in dimension, human society in general-and the small countries in particular are placing special hope in the United Nations. We all see with regret that many parties to many of the problems facing the world\ntoday try their best to avoid bringing to the machinery of this Organization, its organs and specialized agencies questions in which their vital interests are involved. If this process is allowed to go on unchecked in the direction in\nwhich it has been heading in recent years, it will inevitably lead to this result: either the United Nations will become a burdensome bureaucracy, or the world will be misled into a dangerous condition of self-deception, or both.\n4. In the not-too-distant past, the world discovered too late that this course of events could only lead us to catastrophic consequences. It is still early enough to re-examine our experience with the United Nations and to\nfind ways effectively to carry out the basic principles embodied in its Charter. It is on this basis that the delegation of Afghanistan wishes to emphasize the necessity for a genuine, deep and practical discussion of item 24 of the agenda.\n5.\tIn this, I address myself not only to the great Powers but also to the entire membership of this Organization. It is the responsibility of all of us to make the Charter, and this Organization, an effective instrument to create better political, economic and social conditions in the world in which we all live and must live together.\n6.\tWe shall present our view on that subject when the question comes before the General Assembly for debate, so we shall not go into detail about it here. However, I do want to say that, as a small nation, we should like to see the United Nations reflect the true conscience of the world whenever the idea of naked power, and of economic and political dominance, attempts to obscure the need for a balanced approach to international politics.\n7.\tThis Organization should not in any way be prohibited from serving as a free forum of the community of nations and as an instrument for arriving, by means of constructive dialogs, at just and viable solutions to the many problems facing the world. In this spirit, my delegation would like to voice its full appreciation of the remarks made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report to this Assembly on the work of the Organization [A18701J Add.l]. We hope that the detente of the great Powers will encompass the finding of means to strengthen the United Nations, rather than by-passing this Organization and taking the world back to the methods of the era before its birth.\n8.\tIn this context, it would be relevant to refer to one tragedy the shadow of which continues to hang over the conscience of all of us who have assembled here. From this rostrum we have spoken a number of times about the fate of the people of Viet-Nam. It is high time that the community of nations as a whole seriously addressed itself to this continuing threat to international peace and security. Afghanistan has always supported a solution of the question of Viet-Nam-and of all Indochina based on the decisive role of the will of the peoples of the area themselves in determining their own destiny without any foreign intervention. We shall continue to render our support to the struggling people of the Indochinese peninsula on the basis of these principles, which can be considered the sole criteria for the solution of their problems.\n9.\tWe shall have the opportunity of commenting on the individual items composing the agenda of this session of the General Assembly as they arise. Being conscious of the necessity to economize the very valuable time of this \naugust Assembly, I shall only summarize very briefly at this time the views of the Afghan delegation, and of my Government, on some of the major developments of the period between the last session of the General Assembly and the present one.\n10.\tThe first of these developments is, fortunately, a positive one. The increasing recognition of and adherence to the philosophy of non-alignment, and its role in world politics, is a source of particular satisfaction to Afghanistan. In the past year alone, many events and even the attitudes of some of the great Powers have indicated this trend. The recent Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Georgetown, Guyana in August, has made a significant contribution to the further development of the concepts of peaceful coexistence and to the application of independent judgment to international events solely on the basis of their merit. The non-aligned countries of the world are looking forward to the summit meeting to be held next year in Algeria and are confident that it will make a positive contribution both to the noble cause of international peace and security and to the development of better relations among the different members of the world community.\n11.\tThe question of international peace and security naturally leads to that of world disarmament. We would like to join in the earnest appeal of all the peace-loving nations for a rapid and complete end to the dangerous race in armaments, If we do not achieve the goal of total disarmament for which our generation and the ones preceding us have so earnestly longed, the planet on which we live will be an inherently unsafe dwelling place not only for us and for our children but for their children as well.\n12.\tWith regard to the problem of terrorism, we would like to bring to the attention of this Assembly the following essential observations. To disturb the safety of innocent people anywhere in the world cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. However, in the light of this same basic norm of human conduct, no one should be allowed to deceive the world into believing that equally innocent people, deprived of their land and communal entity, shall have no right to fight for the recovery of their usurped homes. It is the urgent responsibility of this Organization and particularly of the major Powers of the world to use all the means at their disposal for finding and applying a solution to the problem of Palestine. Among all the matters of war and peace, none is more dangerous nor demands our attention more than the situation in the Middle East a situation created by the occupation of Arab territories by Israel and by its blunt refusal to withdraw its forces from those territories. With a shaky and precarious history of cease-fires, no progress has been made towards a satisfactory settlement in that troubled area.\n13.\tOver 20 years of usurpation of the Palestinian people's rights and the continued trampling of their ancestral land by an alien conqueror should not lead the international community to forget that there exists a distinct entity called Palestine and a distinct people called the Palestinians, whose destiny is indistinguishably linked with the soil on which they have been living since time immemorial. It is our ardent hope that the General Assembly at its present session, by taking adequate measures in this regard, will contribute to the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian Arabs. The immediate and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from all territories of the three Arab countries namely, Egypt, Syria, and Jordan-is another essential prerequisite for the establishment of a durable peace in the Middle East. To deal with the problem in any other way would be, to paraphrase a Persian poem, \\\"Wiping the tears from our faces without assuaging the anguish from which we weep\\\".\n14.\tMy Government welcomed the spirit that prevailed in the conference of the leaders of Pakistan and India at Simla. It is truly within the spirit of the Charter of this Organization that, at last, in the troubled IndoPakistani subcontinent dialog is beginning to replace the use of arms or the threat of such use. It would be a significant contribution to the victory of the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes to see peace reigning at last over the countries of the subcontinent, and to see Pakistan, Bangladesh and India co-operating in the different spheres of life for the benefit of all the peoples of all three countries.\n15.\tThe noble efforts deployed by the United Nations Committee on decolonization  have all the support of the people and the Government of Afghanistan. I would like to reiterate once again our sympathy with, and our backing for, all nations and peoples still struggling for the recognition of their right to self-determination. The abolition of all forms and manifestations of colonialism and imperialism and of racial discrimination and apartheid is a basic objective of the Charter; and all of us present here are bound by our pledges to its provisions and purposes to extend whatever support is at our disposal to the achievement of these goals.\n16.\tFor Afghanistan itself, colonialism has left a very unfortunate heritage. It is our hope that the question of Pakhtunistan will be solved on the basis of the right of self-determination for the Pakhtun and Baluchi inhabitants of that land. It is the national and international duty of the people and the Government of Afghanistan to pursue, by all peaceful means at their disposal, the just and noble cause of the people of Pakhtunistan. This problem, in essence, emanated from a very typical colonial injustice.\n17.\tThe right of the people of Pakhtunistan freely to choose their own destiny was denied them when the classical form of Western colonialism ended in the Indian subcontinent through its partition a quarter century ago. The land of Pakhtunistan, in spite of not being part of the subcontinent, was added to one of the two new States without its inhabitants having been accorded an opportunity to exercise freely their right to self-determination. The peaceful settlement of this matter is one of the major aims of Afghanistan's foreign policy; but since the question has not been formally put before the General Assembly, it is not our intention to go into further discussion of the problem at this time.\n18.\tThe economic development of the under-developed peoples of the world, which unfortunately constitute the majority of the inhabitants of our globe, ii essential not only to the question of international peace and security but also to the well-being-present and future of human society as a whole and to the deceit self-respect of us all. The outcome of the third Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] t held at Santiago in April and May, was a source of genuine disturbance to the small and poor nations of the world, If the menacing gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to widen further, it will soon be very difficult to consider the inhabitants of the world as one human society in the true sense of the word. We hope that this problem will be given sufficient time and consideration during the deliberations of the present session of the General Assembly so that the flame of hope for the future of the developing countries can remain alight.\n19.\tAt this juncture one point deserves special mention. As we all know, it is specifically stated in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J that special measures in favor of the least developed countries should be adopted so as to enable those countries to benefit fully and equitably from the general measures contained in the Strategy. In the view of my Government, the general division of the world into developed and developing countries ii a simplistic view which is no longer valid. The developing world is divided into two groups, developing and least developed. That fact has already been recognized by the International Development Strategy, as well as in numerous resolutions of the various bodies of the United Nations system. Some of the least developed countries are land-locked and are thus doubly handicapped.\n20.\tAs I stated earlier, the gap between the developed and the developing countries and between the latter and the least developed among them is fast widening. The identification of the least developed countries is a dramatic phenomenon in the painstakingly slow process of searching for solutions to the socio-economic problems of the countries of the world. The concept of the developing countries as a single group having more similarities than differences proved to be inaccurate. The criteria established for the identification of those .countries demonstrate that they are countries with extremely vulnerable subsistence economies. Two years of continued and severe drought in the case of my country, for example, not only disrupted the precarious economic balance but also plunged the country into unprecedented socio-economic chaos.\n21.\tWe agree, as we have often repeated in various international documents that the primary responsibility for the economic development of the developing countries rests upon those countries themselves. But there is another fact, which applies in no case more than it does to the least developed countries: the efforts of those countries for development cannot succeed without urgent, comprehensive and sustained international assistance and co-operation. That fact has been recognized by the developed as well as other developing countries in numerous documents, the most recent of them UNCTAD resolution 62 (III), which contains specific commitments and measures. It is high time to ascertain to what extent these promises are going to be kept.\n22.\tEfforts during the past several years by a number of countries resulted in the unanimous adoption of resolution 63 (III) at Santiago last spring. That resolution, while not satisfying entirely the needs and claims of the developing land-locked countries, could nevertheless be regarded as a major step in the right direction. As stipulated in numerous studies and resolutions of various United Nations bodies, land-locked developing countries need, first, to adapt their economies to their special geographic situation, and secondly, to sure the free and unrestricted transit of their trade to the sea and to third countries, and vice versa. Those two needs should be satisfied simultaneously and not consecutively. Resolution 63 (III) provides guide-lines for special measures to be taken in both these fields. While the first measures, which are the responsibility of developed countries and international organizations, are of a rather long-term nature, the second set of measures, which are the responsibility of transit countries and international organizations, deserve immediate attention. Such measures as the preparation of a transport strategy and the study of administrative and customs procedures in transit countries could not be carried out without sincere and complete co-operation by the transit countries.\n23.\tWe hope that the UNCTAD secretariat, as well as responsible bodies in various international organizations, will take swift and effective measures to implement those decisions of the third session of UNCTAD. We further hope that all countries concerned will adopt a constructive attitude towards these questions and extend their full co-operation to the other parties concerned. The Government of Afghanistan, in co-operation with other land-locked countries, will closely follow developments in this field and is ready to offer its full co-operation and assistance for the implementation of the provisions of UNCTAD resolution 63 (III).\n24.\tWe attach substantial importance to the development of the law of the sea along the lines leading to the possibility of access for all the nations of the world to the riches of the sea-bed beyond the limits of the national jurisdiction of individual nations. Special attention must be paid to the status and the needs of the land-locked countries. That is true not only with regard to the riches of the sea-bed but also with regard to freedom of transit and other facilities that are desperately needed for the economic growth of those land-locked countries.\n25.\tAfghanistan in the last three years has had to cope with the catastrophic consequences of a very severe drought. Many Members of the United Nations have generously, and in compliance with the resolution of sympathy adopted by the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2757(XXVI)], extended help and sympathy to our people in their moment of distress. I consider it my duty to express, on behalf of the people and the Government of Afghanistan, our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all those countries which have so kindly extended their aid. I would like especially to thank the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, for his message to the various specialized agencies of the United Nations concerned with this problem, and those agencies for the timely help they have rendered in the face of this natural catastrophe.\n26.\tIn conclusion, I express the hope that this twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly will mark a significant step forward in the deliberations and activities of the United Nations all through the year.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of my Government, I wish to express to you my sincere congratulations upon your election. It is a well-deserved tribute to your country, a land of age-old culture that has always been present at the crossroads of history, and, above all, a country that has always been a cradle of heroic men. It is, moreover, a proper recognition of your great merits as a highly capable and dedicated public figure.\n108.\tMay we on this occasion pay a cordial tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, who had the honor to preside over the General Assembly at the last session.\n109.\tWe could not at this time fail to remember our unforgettable friend UThant, or to pay him our most heartfelt tribute for his untiring and distinguished endeavors. His outstanding qualities have left an indelible impression on the minds of all those of us who were privileged to know him, and the pleasant memory of his kind personality.\n110.\tI should like especially to offer our warmest congratulations to our present Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. His distinguished career as an enlightened and dedicated man, committed to the loftiest ideals, undoubtedly ensure a promising future for the United Nations.\n111.\tIn this general debate we shall refrain from giving our detailed position on the specific items in the agenda. My delegation will put forward the views of my Government in the relevant debates.\n112.\tNever have men felt so close to one another as today. Many factors have contributed to this phenomenon: distance is no longer the obstacle it once was; we have the means to travel with incredible speed from one part of the earth to another. The revolution in transport has been followed by a revolution in the means of social communication. Thus, in our time, it is possible for men to contact each other at any point or in any region of the world, almost immediately.\n113.\tThe impressive growth of the world's population has become a further element of change. Because of the population explosion or to be more precise the demographic revolution the earth is becoming increasingly smaller for an ever-larger population. With the ever-faster migration from the rural to the urban areas, we witness the emergence of metropolis and megalopolis, gigantic cities whose inhabitants live in overcrowded conditions.\n114.\tMan's landing on the moon has enabled us to reach a new dimension: that of space. Our earth is almost beginning to look like an enormous spaceship. As we stated last year in this Assembly:\n\\\"Thus there emerges a new concept: that of mankind. We think of mankind as all the peoples of the world and, thus conceived, mankind appears to us as a world-wide society which encompasses us all and which is in opposition to individual societies or States, having their own lives, it is true, but dependent on the development of that greater society.\\\" [1944th meeting, para. 8.]\n115.\tAt the same time, the technological revolution, with the profound changes it has introduced in all the material instruments of human life, has generated a growing process of mass phenomena. This is a continuing social process of progressive depersonalization. The human person-man, as a being endowed with reason and liberty is replaced by mass man. In that mass man, primitive reactions prevail over rational life. He becomes the easy victim of manipulation processes; that is to say, he is at the mercy of those who know how to handle the media of social communication and the techniques of psychology so as to influence man's fundamental attitudes.\n116.\tThe consequences of these mass phenomena are far-reaching and deep-seated. Man dehumanized, one of the mass, has abdicated his fundamental condition as a human being, namely, the predominance of reason. Critical judgment has been replaced by emotional reaction, rational life by emotional life.\n117.\tThus it is that dehumanized man can easily become the plaything of the most diverse pressure groups. He has become fertile soil for the emergence of every kind of hatred and rancor, for all sorts of sectarian positions, however inconceivable, and for every kind of act, however brutal. Finally, this depersonalized, mass man, is capable of any sacrifice for the sake of myths imposed on him and to which he clings emotionally of every kind of violence, unable as he is to grasp the full significance of his acts.\n118.\tParadoxically and just as man is beginning to feel the unity and solidarity of mankind, just as he is feeling closer than ever to all men, we witness what would appear to be the collapse of all the values on which his conduct and behavior were based. This phenomenon affects the whole of mankind, and there is no country on earth where all the principles that have governed man's, life hitherto are not questioned. There is thus born an attitude of rebellion against every rule and of challenge to all authority.\n119.\tWithin that society of the masses, a very important role is played by all the public opinion manipulation procedures, for, through them, it is possible to distort reality to the extent of leaving man as if he were suspended in a vacuum. In point of fact, truth is intermingled with error to the extent that it is not possible to discern where the truth is. On the other hand, error is clothed as truth to the point that it is no longer possible to discover where the error lies. Such a situation engenders a reversal of values and the most serious mental confusion, creating a fertile ground for the proliferation of every kind of extremism and sectarianism.\n120.\tViewed from this angle, the world today appears to be compressed between two opposite movements: one, which accumulates motives for division and violence, the other which reveals the possibility of a unity which, for the first time, is truly expanding to embrace the whole of the human race.\n121.\tIndeed, on the one hand, never as in our time have more efforts been deployed to achieve solidarity and understanding among men and peoples. The strongest proof of this fact is the constant increase in the large number of international organizations and activities oriented to serve mankind.\n122.\tYet, on the other hand, never before, perhaps, has the world been so submerged in an atmosphere of violence as it is today. But at this point it becomes necessary to define our terms. In this connexion, in my intervention before this Assembly at the twenty-fifth session I stated that:\n\u2022 \\\"In ordinary language violence is often confused with force. But this is an error. Force is the body of all means and procedures\\\" of every kind: physical, psychological, economic, and so on\\\" used by law for the enforcement of law. On the other hand, violence signifies the illegal use of force meaning the indiscriminate use of force not in accordance with pre-established principles.\\\" [1841st meeting, para. 108. ]\n123.\tThe new development in the contemporary world is the deification of violence. It is paid almost religious reverence. We are faced with an existentialist attitude and, consequently, with a new set of values. The ends make the means good. A violent act becomes good if it permits the achievement of the objectives pursued. The followers of the new religion of violence maintain and proclaim that they will stop at no crime to put an end to injustice. They forget that if an unjust act and because unjust therefore violent is answered with a violent act-and because violent therefore unjust we shall have changed nothing on earth since qualitatively we shall be on exactly the same plane of injustice.\n124.\tIt is a complex social reality, an effect with multiple causes and the cause of multiple effects. It involves many diverse dynamic factors. Let us analyze briefly the most conspicuous ones.\n125.\tA very small number of States the so-called developed States control the greater part of the wealth and the scientific and technological knowledge of the world. On the other hand, the nations of the developing world see that with each year that passes the existing imbalance between them and the industrialized countries grows wider.\n126.\tProfound social and economic differences wealth and near-poverty, opulence and misery, a vast number of inadmissible contrasts in a human society separate the various national groups within States, particularly in the developing countries.\n127.\tAt the international level, the centers of power and decision are concentrated in a few nations. Whether in the balance of blocs or through multi-polarization, various methods of subjection are erected to the benefit of the great Powers.\n128.\tQuite often the financing of development gives rise to situations of economic and political subjection which moreover and not infrequently strengthen the unfair structures of the developing countries. A European Minister in this connexion commented, in rather malicious terms: \\\"Assistance for development is what the poor people in the rich countries give the rich people in the poor countries\\\".\n129.\tThe desire of States for power and their ambition to dominate engenders the various forms of economic and ideological imperialism. On the other hand, situations of oppression and tyranny at the national and international levels are proliferating.\n130.\tNew ideological trends are assuming radical positions and acquire messianic and, to a certain extent, apocalyptic features. Fanatically determined to destroy the existing structures by any means, they resort to systematized violence in order to compound their psychological effect through terror. Thus, systems of permanent subversion are created; conflicts of every kind become more acute, and the most refined means of psychological action are used to submit the will.\n131.\tThere is an atmosphere of ethical pollution that is gradually extending to all nations. This process is facilitated by the disintegration of the values by which mankind has so far lived. As a result, several phenomena of social disorder emerge, such as an alarming increase in drug traffic, an increase in crime and the release of primary instincts, phenomena which in turn become polluting agents.\n132.\tThe progress achieved in the means of social communication also contributes to the climate of violence. The \\\"cultural patterns\\\" they impose surreptitiously through their productions not infrequently contain an exaltation of the violent and therefore of violence. Similarly, the technological advances made in the means of social communication, place at the disposal of States possessing them a hitherto unknown power of cultural control over other States. Today, a nation may well lose its personality as the victim of a cultural invasion which has all the appearances of being a peaceful act but which is none the less fraught with psychological murders.\n133.\tOn the other hand, morally speaking, technological progress per se is neither good nor bad. It all depends on the use men make of it. For that reason, technological progress can and in fact does provide its refinements to the various manifestations of violence.\n134.\tThe crisis in religious values also has an unfavorable effect, especially in those countries whose religions actively advocate love of one's neighbor and solidarity among men. The eclipse of such values, though momentary, has a negative effect as the appeal to the ever-implicit ethical elevation of man is obscured.\n135.\tRacial discrimination is still, in today's world, an uninterrupted source of violent conflicts. Man's rejection of man for reasons of race gives rise to unending hatred, often aggravated by various other factors that are intermixed with it.\n136.\tThis brief analysis we have outlined shows the complexity of the phenomenon of violence. One of its specific manifestations-perhaps the one that has the greatest impact is terrorism. Terrorism is one of the items on the agenda of the current session. I therefore wish to refer to it specifically.\n137.\tFor all the aforesaid reasons, I believe that terrorism cannot be considered in isolation; rather it must be considered within the overall context in which it is engendered. It is that context that we have endeavored to summarize.\n138.\tWe understand the desire to submit terrorist activities having international repercussions to juridical regulation of universal character. However, while placing ourselves in the field of law, we cannot lose sight of the principles that should inspire any juridical regulation.\n139.\tIn our statement at the third special session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States on 26 January 1971, we said in this connexion that law arose to encompass the life from which it proceeded and moved between the desirable and the feasible. We said in simple terms like a great Belgian jurist, Professor Jean Dabin, that on the legal plane not everything that was desirable was feasible and conversely not everything that was feasible was desirable and that it was in the balance between the desirable and the feasible that the optimum juridical norm could be located. We then added that it was therefore obvious that terrorism, because it was a complex phenomenon which was still undefined, could not be regulated in its entirety other than to the extent that clear social situations were being established to which clear-cut laws could be applied.\n140.\tPositive law is oriented towards the attainment of the common good, inspired in an ideal of justice, within the limits established by juridical security. In other words, juridical regulations, from the point of view of the technique of law, are limited by the principle of juridical security. This is the basis for the Roman aphorism, \\\"summum jus, summa injuria\\\". Consequently, any juridical regulation which seeks to embody sanctions against acts of violence having international repercussions cannot disregard these fundamental ideas. Thus, for example, there is in the Latin American countries a very wide traditional concept of the right of asylum. In any possible regulation the true and real humanitarian character of this institution must be safeguarded.\n141.\tOn the other hand, every juridical norm must tend, by its very nature, towards its effective implementation. From the standpoint of the law and its purposes, it would be a contradiction in terms to dictate a juridical norm and not to apply it. At the international level this presupposes, moreover, the possibility of ratification by the largest possible number of States, especially in the case of the regulation of an act having multiple international repercussions.\n142.\tFor all these reasons we believe, justifiably, that in any attempt to regulate acts of violence having international repercussions, prudence which does not exclude firmness must be exercised. We must, in like manner, proceed gradually that is to say, step by step, as results are obtained. Furthermore, the greatest possible number of national approvals should be sought, in order to make the provisions as effective as possible. That is why it is necessary to identify acts with great accuracy and to regulate those that command the consent of the largest number of nations which believe in the eminent dignity of the human person. Consequently, the most appropriate thing to do would be to address ourselves to fundamental situations: those most relevant to the universal common good, the ultimate objective of international law. To proceed otherwise would be to risk a regulation that would be impossible to apply adequately, through lack of universal ratification.\n143.\tThe principles that should guide the struggle against violence and its various manifestations are the defence of the eminent dignity of the human person and the safeguarding of justice in international relations. In other words, the struggle against violence is aimed at ensuring man's dignity and safeguarding a just system of international relations. It is for this reason that all we have said does not, of course, preclude the right of peoples to rebel against tyranny, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism or any other form of oppression. Indeed, in this case, it is the oppressors who practice violence; and the right to rebellion, legitimately exercised, represents the effort of the people to restore the infringed juridical order.\n144.\tAll this is perfectly logical, since the different forms of oppression are attempts directed against the eminent dignity of the human person and, by disregarding it, are lacking in legality. Therefore, it is essential that at the same time that we proclaim the legitimate right of peoples to fight against the different forms of violence we should proclaim the right of peoples to rebel against the different forms of oppression. We are not trying by this means to allow the very violence we wish to combat. Indeed, the exercise of the legitimate right of peoples to rebel against the different forms of oppression is embodied within very specific ethical and political principles. We shall enumerate them briefly.\n145.\tIt is necessary for the prevailing system to be unjust as a whole that is to say, as a system.\n146.\tAll lawful means of combating the unjust order must have been exhausted. It is not, therefore, a question of irresponsibly exercising the right of recourse to force against the unjust order. Great harm will ensue as a result of that struggle. In other words, it is necessary that the system, by its very injustice, leaves no other alternative but force.\n147.\tThe system to be instituted must be more just than the one that is combated, which presupposes that to destroy the existing one without preparing the regime that is to follow would not be admissible. Moreover, it is the justice of the system to be instituted that, among other reasons, makes legitimate the right to institute it.\n148.\tDefinite prospects of success are required, so as not to subject the people to greater evils than those that are being fought.\n149.\tUltimately, we cannot resort to any means indiscriminately. These, too, are subject to ethical norms. For instance, innocent persons, quite removed from the drama surrounding them, could not be attacked, and any kind of violence against the different means used by man to bring together the peoples of the world would be inadmissible.\n150.\tThe principles we have just enunciated are based on the thinking of great philosophers and are still valid today. We believe that we should not forget them; that we should take them into account, in order that, in attempting to fight violence we should not fall into a serious error which could be used as a pretext by tyrannical regimes to maintain the unjust order.\n151.\tHaving made this reservation, we condemn terrorism in all its forms because we condemn recourse to violence. The latter carries within it its own lethal dialectics: one act of violence is followed by another in a dynamic crescendo of recourse to violence.\n152.\tIn man's every thought and heart-beat there is always a direct relationship between the positive-evolutionary forces and the instinctive-regressive violence. That dangerous relationship makes it possible to assess the risks and the advantages. And there will always be more risks than advantages, because hatred and violence spring from animal instinct, whereas understanding and friendship are created and recreated in the heart guided by reason.\n153.\tWe reject as anti-human the postulate of inevitable violence, since its blind outbreak implies the very surrender of the human condition. But at the same time, we affirm that neither classical pacifism nor the dialectics of atomic horror, nor a Utopian international ideology will either singly or jointly suffice to solve the crucial problem of the violence and exasperation of the present-day world. Ideological hatred, generator of mistrust, misunderstanding and fanaticism, continues to be the major factor responsible for violence.\n154.\tBut violence is not exercised exclusively through action. Omission and negligence in the face of a state of violence may be equally compromising. The spirit guilty of routine and the status quo of inertia and immobility in the face of conflicts and divergences are the direct cause of the irrational paroxysm of violence. Thus, before the final judgment of history and mankind, those responsible for omission or surrender of the necessary political will are as guilty as the irrational agents of violence themselves.\n155.\tThe struggle against violence is, therefore, not only a juridical but a political, economic, social, cultural, ethical and religious fact as well. It is a task devolving on us all. It entails individual and collective, national and international action. It likewise entails the institution of a new international order in which relations among peoples lead towards the attainment of the universal common good inspired in international social justice. Indeed, in the final analysis, the struggle against violence is the building of peace itself.\n"

        "file_text": "One of the major characteristics of the present world situation is that we have very good news and very bad news at the same time.\n25.\tThe most recent very good news was that representatives of the thermonuclear Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, declared in a joint ceremonial act, with the participation of Foreign Minister Gromyko and President Nixon in Washington, the coming into force of their Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, signed at Moscow on 26 May 1972. In a matter of crucial importance to the future of all mankind, the effort to stop the danger of a thermonuclear war from increasing, this is indeed a historic event.\n26.\tOn the other hand, it is very bad news that almost simultaneously B-52 bombers directed one of their most massive attacks against the Democratic Republic of VietNam.\n27.\tIn this state of international relations two sorts of opinions can be heard in the general debate at the current session of the General Assembly. The vast majority of Member States have been pleased to note the generally favorable change in the world situation. Some speakers, on the other hand, have talked as if there had been no improvement in international relations and, what is even worse as if the phenomena regarded by others as signs of improvement actually portended new dangers. This concern expressed in statements by a good number of speakers has been given voice for very respectable reasons. But there have been speakers on this rostrum who think that the sublimated right and good of mankind would be served by the outbreak of a thermonuclear war. Those who have expressed such views have not even attempted to make any constructive proposal reflecting what their Governments believe to be a way to solve the problems. There being two kinds of tones heard in this debate, we cannot turn a deaf ear to the negative voices. I am sure, though, that the negative voices will gradually be isolated and dwindle away. Even at this session of the General Assembly they have diminished in number, extent and intensity alike. We must nevertheless take seriously those facts upon which they feel they have a right to build their absurd concept of the world situation. And we ought to do so even in the absence of such deplorable and negative utterances.\n28.\tI would have very many reasons to begin my statement by explaining my Government's views on the most favorable aspects of the present international situation, first of all because Hungary is a European country and the most promising signs can be seen in Europe. It is also an exceptional case in the history of the United Nations that both the President of the General Assembly and, the Secretary-General of the United Nations are representatives of European countries. It has been in these days that for the first time in the history of Europe a joint conference was held by the mayors of all European capitals, and that conference took place precisely in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary.\n29.\tStill, I shall not start with this. I am going to expound my Government's position, not on the favorable, but on the unfavorable phenomena, in the hope that there will be an improvement in relations where they need improving; that is to say, that the improvement of international relations will be extended to areas in which the obsolete rules of life of a bygone world are still kept alive.\n30.\tIt is clear that we live in revolutionary times. We are witnessing great changes of which we are at the same time passive and creative factors. There is a variety of adjectives to describe the forces in the world today. It can be said that there are peaceful forces and aggressive forces. It can be said that there are progressive forces and reactionary forces. Blended with all these, it can be said, there are forces, governments and aspirations which put into effect measures workable at a given time and place, for they understand the call of the times; and there are those which, by putting unworkable measures into effect, make themselves out of step, for they cannot understand the call of the times. There are people, individuals, governments and statutory measures that have outlived their time.\n31.\tIn the thermonuclear age the peoples have to reexamine the practices, laws and international relations they have maintained thus far, their conception of international law, the ideas they have of the questions of war and peace. They have to restudy-and I say this with good reason- even their principles regarding just and unjust wars. What might earlier have seemed, to a great extent, to be just wars should today be eliminated.\n32.\tThis acclimatization to new conditions is not an easy matter, nor can it be done very rapidly. But history goes on, and those who belong in the junk heap will be carried there by the tide of history. I now quote from a poet of Hungary's revolutionary past who expressed death and the coming of the new generation in an image of the decay and the revival of nature in the spring: \\\"... we are pushed, as the tree's young leaves push off the leaves of yesteryear.\\\"\n33.\tYes, after tremendous historical catastrophes-and at the price of the wonderful sacrifices they entailed for man-a new epoch of mankind is being shaped today under comparatively easy circumstances. In a period of historic changes and changes in social systems, one can observe today a considerable relaxation and, because of an awareness of joint responsibilities, considerable co-operation in the relationship between the principal opposing forces, primarily between those on which the question of whether or not there will be a thermonuclear war depends. This relaxation, however, is not perceived and felt by all.\n34.\tI wish now to examine, in their international context, those areas where the effect of relaxation cannot as yet be perceived.\n35.\tThe two VietNamese parties to the Paris talks on the question of Viet-Nam-the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and, together with Madame Binh, the representatives of the national liberation movement do not feel, because they cannot feel, the improvement in international relations. Still less is this improvement felt by the families of the victims lying in blood and dirt in North and South Viet-Nam in the wake of the wanton ravages of bombing raids. In characterizing the situation by means of a literary quotation, I do not at all intend to mitigate the gravity of this tragedy which is practically unprecedented in the history of South-East Asia. On the contrary, I should like to point out the historical depth of the tragedy.\n36.\tIn the middle of the last century, in the very, very dark years of Hungarian history there were many such years back in the past and also recently the author Imre Madach, who might be said to have been the offspring of both the Slovak and the Hungarian peoples, in his drama entitled \\\"The Tragedy of Man\\\" outlined the past and future of mankind, which he brought to the surface out of the severe sufferings of his private life. This dramatic series of world historical scenes describes, besides the paradise of the first human couple, Athens, Rome and many other things, as well as the construction of the pyramids in ancient Egypt, where a slave dies. In this scene someone tries to console the slave's wife for her loss, saying that it means just one suffering man less. Thereupon the wife replies in these words:\n\\\"A mere number to you, to me the whole world.\n\\\"Alas, beloved, who will love me now? \\\"\nWith this literary quotation I have wished to bring here, into the hall of the United Nations General Assembly, those untold human sufferings which are virtually increasing in some parts of the globe in spite of the fact that we have very serious reasons to talk of improvement in international relations.\n37.\tThe general improvement of the international situation does not yet make itself felt in the Viet-Nam question, although the VietNamese side has sketched, with the largest possible measure of political realism, the outlines of an end to the war, a suitable international agreement, and the future of both North and South Viet-Nam. No one can doubt that this is the way of the future. There is no other way. It was a miscalculation in 1964 to devise the Tonkin Bay incident. It was a miscalculation in 1965 to start bombing North Viet-Nam. It was the proper thing in December 1965 to suspend the bombing attacks. It was a miscalculation again to resume bombing in 1966. It was a miscalculation to dispatch a United States armed force of more than 700,000 men to Viet-Nam. It was a miscalculation, while reducing the numerical strength of military personnel, to step up the attacks of mechanized warfare. Eventually there will be practically no one in the whole world who will know what business the United States of America has at all to be in Viet-Nam. One has an impression that even those who send American boys to Viet-Nam do not know that either.\n38.\tIn Viet-Nam it is thus impossible to perceive that the international situation is improving. Time, however, is on the side of those who want the effects of the prevailing conditions of international life to be felt also in the VietNamese question.\n39.\tThe Hungarian people and their Government support those constructive proposals, which give a sketch of a new, peaceful future of the Far East as a whole, and which have been set forth by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam, together with the liberation movement. We can be sure that these proposals provide the realistic core of a solution to the problems. They have been drawn up by men who live there among the people and who do not seek to let the people suffer from the war and its consequences as long as possible, but who want the people to enjoy the blessings of peace as soon as possible. The main requirement raised in those proposals is in fact the removal of a single man with a small group. What the sons of the American nation are. dying for in Viet-Nam is actually the monomania of a single man, Thieu.\n40.\tThe improvement of international relations is imperceptible not only in Viet-Nam, but in the Middle East as well. It is difficult to convince the peoples of the Arab countries that international relations are improving. For five years now those peoples have been waiting for something to be done on the strength of the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council in November 1967, resolution 242(1967). Some interested Powers argue that there is an essential difference between the English and French texts of that resolution. This difference really exists, but it is not this that enhances the world-wide historical importance of the problem but rather the need to secure the conditions of peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Middle East.\n41.\tThe Government of Israel would make a real contribution to the continued improvement of the international situation if it could take into consideration two facts: one of them concerns the historic aspects of the issue; the other bears a relation to international law.\n42.\tAfter the end of the Second World War the progressive forces of the world here in the United Nations also came out in favor of the restoration to their homeland of the dispersed people of Israel because they hoped to do something good for the future of the peoples. In the years of the preparatory and initial stages of the Second World War, fascism, anti-Semitism, racial hatred, the German Ubermensch notion, and Ausradierung (the radical extermination of the Jewish people) became, as it were, the most sternly dominant factors in Europe. Never in the history of mankind have people been killed in such a concentrated manner, in such large numbers and in relatively so short a time as during the era of fascism in Europe. The Soviet Union-which many charge with anti-Semitism today was the decisive factor that made it possible to crush the Fascist Powers, which had sought the complete destruction of Jewry. Had it not been for the Soviet Union, it would not have been possible to defeat Hitlerite Germany.\n43.\tThis year the Soviet Union celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of its existence. This is one of the most significant anniversaries in modern history. We are glad that this event occurs at a time when the biggest Power of the other hemisphere has joined in working out the conditions of peaceful coexistence between the two thermonuclear Powers.\n44.\tI have digressed from the Middle East question, but only apparently. It is not without reason that many see precisely in the problems of the Middle East region the danger of a new world war, a thermonuclear war. The further trend of the situation in the Middle East will largely depend on relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n45.\tThe Government of Israel would therefore do a great service to the favorable development of international life if it could take into account the fact that progressive mankind brought into existence or restored the State of Israel in the hope that a progressive, peaceful and happy enclave of humanity would emerge in the restored homeland of the persecuted Jews. Instead of this, a policy of imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and racial hatred manifests itself in all that Israeli Governments have done since the establishment of the State of Israel. We, the Hungarian Government, are very much interested in the fate of Israel. Many Hungarian Jewish families, persecuted at the time, have since sought new homes in the \\\"Promised Land\\\". They have a large number of relatives living in Hungary today. These people are also adversely affected by the pursuit by the ruling quarters of Israel of their anti-Arab policy of aggression.\n46.\tIn the light of these historic facts, the Israeli Government could do much to promote the favorable development of international relations if it took seriously into consideration Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations Charter is the principal source of international law today. In pursuance of Article 51 of the Charter, if a Member State victim of armed attack does not receive sufficient effective assistance from the United Nations Security Council, that State has an unrestricted right to resort to any means, including the use of armed force, to repulse the aggression. Since Israel is unwilling to comply with Security Council resolution 242 (1967), the Arab countries victims of aggression have full authority under international law to reoccupy by armed force the territories occupied by the aggressor.\n47.\tThese two factors-the historical one and the one based on international law-can for a short time be ignored by the Government of Israel, which feigns to be deaf and blind to them, but by so doing it undermines the very existence of the State of Israel.\n48.\tWith profound responsibility towards the future of the people of Israel one can state the following. The Government of Israel has before it proposals from Arab countries that can place the national security of Israel beyond question; if, however, the Government of Israel cannot take these proposals in all seriousness-proposals which are founded on the Security Council resolution-then it will dig the grave of Israel. At home in Hungary we often speak about the role of short-sighted men in politics. With regard to Israel it can be said that in the short-term time might favour the Israeli leaders stricken with short-sightedness, but in the historical perspective those persons will bury the country of Israel for good. The hard facts of history provide examples of how some nations disappeared from the historical scene in consequence of vicious acts by irresponsible leaders. If Israel's leaders of today imagine that, owing to their specific geographical position, the international influence of Zionism that is spread all over the world can make their present attitude realistic, they are tragically mistaken.\n49.\tI apologize for having dwelled so long upon this: matter, but the question is one of the most instructive issues not only for the present generation but also, I might say, for the history of all mankind. If the Government of Israel does not draw a lesson from the historic and legal factors, it will inevitably dig the grave of its own country and people. Over the short-term some representatives of the Israeli Government might feel that time is on their side, but they ought to know that the future of Israel hinges on whether or not it will be able to settle the problem of its relations with surrounding Arab countries. It would be an illusion for the Government of Israel to seek to build the future of its country upon international Zionism. There is only one solid and sure foundation on which to build the future of Israel: friendship with the neighboring countries, together with recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.\n50.\tI hope members will not mind my long discussion about the problems of the Middle East, but there is a very serious reason for it. Many people are convinced that the potential source of a new world war is to be found not in Viet-Nam but in the Middle East. A few European Governments, for example, the Government of Austria, back the proposal that the problems of the Middle East and the Mediterranean area should also be placed on the agenda of the prospective European conference on security and co-operation. In addition to all this, in dealing so thoroughly with the Middle East questions, I am prompted also by the fact the the effect of the general improvement of the international situation can be perceived least of all in that region. It is a common international duty of all States Members of the United Nations, an obligation under the Charter, to work out a concrete plan for the peaceful settlement of relations in the Middle East. The Hungarian Government views the efforts of Ambassador Jarring with deep respect and tries not only with good wishes but also with concrete steps to help him to fulfill his historic mission.\n51.\tThe large majority of the States Members of the United Nations are countries of what is called the third world. In Georgetown earlier this year their representatives addressed a strong appeal to other countries of the world, asking for their assistance in solving the economic problems of the developing nations.  While we talk here-and with good reason about improvement in international relations, poverty is increasing in large parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The peoples of the world have to take concerted action to eliminate the last vestiges of colonialism, to liberate the peoples still living under colonial oppression and, at the same time, to help the countries liberated from colonial domination to overcome their economic difficulties.\n52.\tAn important event in the history of the United Nations was the settlement of the question of Chinese representation. The Government of Hungary was pleased to receive the news of events which indicated the lessening of the international isolation of the People's Republic of China and its active participation in world affairs. The settlement of relations between Japan and China is also an event of great importance in international life. It is worth quoting the poem which the Japanese Prime Minister wrote on the historic occasion when, as representative of the Japan of modern history, he was recently on an official visit in the China of the world socialist system. That poem reads as follows:\n\\\"Japan and China broke their relations many years ago,\n\\\"But now the time has come to resume these links.\n\\\"Autumn is approaching.\n\\\"Our neighbors welcome us with warmth in their eyes.\n\\\"The Peking sky is clear, and the autumn air is deep.\\\"\nThat verse is certainly more graceful in Japanese and Chinese than in English or Hungarian. But that is not the point. What is important is that representatives of two great nations have met. Of course it is clear to me that China's rejoining international life could have taken place under more auspicious circumstances. The main reason for the present less auspicious circumstances is that during 22 years the prevalent tendency in this Organization was to boycott the People's Republic of China. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is glad that this issue facing the United Nations has now been solved.\n53.\tBesides the solution of this issue, much more visible signs of the improvement of the international situation can be discerned in Europe. I know that the name of Europe does not have a pleasant ring to the vast majority of Member States. That name is linked with the barbarous centuries of colonialism and the tragedies of two world wars. But now, at the dawn of a new epoch for mankind, when today's generation is preparing to live in the thermonuclear age, Europe is trying to enforce the policy of peaceful coexistence instead of the alternative of the dreadful cataclysm of thermonuclear war.\n54.\tIt is a good thing that at precisely this time both the President of the General Assembly and our Secretary- General are representatives of European countries. I wish to offer both of them my congratulations in this context. The Foreign Minister of Poland, in his statement here in the general debate [2042nd meeting], referred to the tragic past of his country, to the centuries during which Poland had been practically non-existent in terms of international law. Today the Polish people live in the finest period of their history and, thanks to their considerable achievements, have become one of the most active factors of European peace and security and of international cooperation.\n55.\tA very lovely manifestation of the hopes entertained in Europe with regard to the Polish people is a nursery rhyme which two great promoters of the interdependence of the peoples of Central Europe, the two Hungarian composers Zoltan Kodaly and Bela Bartok, discovered at a time, in the early years of the century, when from the legal point of view Poland did not even exist in reality. This nursery rhyme can be rendered into English as follows:\n\\\"Little duckling bathing in the big black pond\n\\\"Is about to visit mother in Poland.\\\"\nToday not only Poland but the other European countries along with it can live in peace and security.\n56.\tIt is this peace and security that we wish to place on more solid foundations than heretofore. That is why we wish to convene a conference on European security and co-operation. This is not merely an affair of Europe. If we put it through properly, it will benefit also other peoples of the world, since the immeasurable resources to be released by the termination of the arms race can then be used to solve fundamental problems concerning the life of mankind.\n57.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic looks to the future with good hope. We think the United Nations has been and will be an expedient engineer of this future. I compliment our new Secretary-General in expressing that belief. Recently the mayors of the European capitals held a meeting in Budapest. On that occasion the Burgomaster of Vienna presented the text of a joint statement. This is the mark of a new stage in the relations between Budapest and Vienna. Secretary-General Waldheim, both as former Ambassador of Austria and as a former Foreign Minister of his country, has had an important share in improving the relations between States in Central Europe. Also on behalf of the Hungarian people and Government we ask him to use the goodwill with which he has promoted friendship between our two peoples in order to contribute on a global scale to strengthening the mutual understanding and security of the peoples of the world.\n58.\tWhen we think of the future of the United Nations, we cannot forget its past either. After the First World War the League of Nations came into being, but was dissolved amid the events following the outbreak of the Second World War. The United Nations was established after the end of the Second World War. Its founders drew a lesson from the experiences of the two World Wars. Nevertheless, this Organization has often found itself in a state of crisis during the past few years. Among the many factors that have saved the existence of this Organization there has been a special, personal factor: die former Secretary-General of the United Nations, UThant. Not only this Organization but the whole of mankind have gone through extremely critical periods in the past years. The wisdom of our former Secretary-General, his responsiveness to human and social problems, his modesty and humility before the great facts of history revealed to us the impressive greatness of his calling in the world and helped many of us to discharge the accumulating tasks confronting the United Nations.\n59.\tI express the wish that ills sense of responsibility will prevail in this Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, in congratulating you on your election to the high office of President of our Assembly, I wish first of all to emphasize the confidence which the Yugoslav delegation places in your outstanding abilities, from which I am certain our session will greatly benefit. In your person I also greet a representative of socialist Poland, a country to which the people of Yugoslavia is linked by ties of deep-rooted friendship and co-operation in all fields.\n101.\tIt gives me great pleasure likewise to associate myself with all those who have expressed their appreciation for the wise way in which the Foreign Minister of the friendly State of Indonesia presided over the work of the twenty- sixth session of our Assembly.\n102.\tI wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, at this first session of the General Assembly which he is attending in his capacity as Secretary-General, our appreciation for the active and notable initiatives he is undertaking.\n103.\tIt is an undeniable fact that the past year has been exceptionally rich in events and in changes. The immediate future will best show, after all that has occurred, whether the world has good reason to feel more at ease and more secure today, or whether its contradictions have merely been somewhat attenuated.\n104.\tThe United Nations has played a great role in preparing and in promoting the current process of negotiation and detente. But it is equally true that a great many events have taken place outside the United Nations and without its participation. Bilateralism in relations among the great Powers can never conflict with the role of the United Nations, with one proviso, and that is that every-thing achieved by the great Powers in their mutual relations contributes toward the creation of better conditions for the effective solution of the fundamental contradictions of our times. In a world characterized by general interdependence, relations among great Powers affect all international relations to such a degree that even their mutual relations can no longer be regarded as their exclusive business. We have no doubts as to what has already been achieved on the bilateral level, but it is our feeling that the international community as a whole must necessarily be the architect of the peace, the progress and the co-operation to which we all aspire and the ensuing responsibilities and obligations are incumbent upon all of us.\n105.\tIn short, we wonder more and more about the nature of the relaxation of tensions, about the negotiations and the detente that are now emerging. What benefits will the smaller and poorer countries derive from the determination of the great and developed countries to avoid conflict among themselves and to normalize their relations?\n106.\tHowever, developments and tendencies that run counter to detente and the easing of tensions, far from having disappeared, have lost nothing of their fundamental force. Imperialism and other forms of hegemony, of economic inequality and foreign interference, far from being checked, are in fact attempting to impose themselves once more in other forms.\n107.\tThe world must beware of tarrying too long at a crossroads where, although general confrontation is not an imminent danger, the solution of the most pressing problems is likewise not an immediate prospect.\n108.\tFor all these reasons, I feel that I am not wrong in saying that a period of new and increased obligations and responsibilities has begun for the United Nations. The United Nations archives are filled with a huge number of documents and decisions, the validity of which no one can question, but the implementation of which is in no wise guaranteed. The United Nations will experience a rebirth only if, in the present detente, it succeeds in finding widening possibilities for asserting its place and its role. The generally more favorable prospects for peace and security should reinforce the safeguards given to all countries and peoples, assuring them that they can be more at ease with regard to their independence and that they can feel greater confidence concerning the acceleration of their material and cultural progress.\n109.\tThe Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, recently held in Georgetown, reflected the needs of the present political moment, aspirations which coincide with the hopes of the greater part of the international community and with the goals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Non-alignment is not an exclusive club, nor is it a sort of collective self-defense. It is a growing political movement which is becoming an ever more influential factor in international relations. At Georgetown too, the non-aligned nations spoke out in favor of a universal detente and for the elimination of pressures exerted by the stronger against the weaker and for the democratization of international relations; they warned against the danger inherent in the monopolization or regional limitation of the process of detente. At that time too, the non-aligned countries energetically demanded the elimination of force and the use thereof, still so frequent and so brutal, and displayed a strong sense of responsibility with regard to the prosperity and destiny of the world as a whole.\n110.\tCoexistence, co-operation and prosperity must be general or they cannot exist at all. It is difficult to build peace but it is easy to disturb it. There will be no coexistence among the great Powers unless a beginning is made towards solution of the major problems of the present-day world.\n111.\tIt is for this reason that Yugoslavia, together with the great family of non-aligned countries which at present constitute a majority of our Organization, calls for an immediate halt to the American bombing in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and for a search for a just political solution on the basis of the constructive proposals submitted by the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the seven-point program of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. The most recent declaration of that Government constitutes one more contribution to the search for such a solution. The five-point program of the Government of Prince Sihanouk offers a firm basis for the restoration of peace and freedom to the people of Cambodia also. The war in Indochina must cease. That war is not only a tragedy for the peoples of IndoChina and a financial drain on the people of the United States, but it is also a difficult trial for all of us. As long as it goes on, in whatever form, it will remain a negative factor in any evaluation of the duration and soundness of the detente that we have welcomed with such great hopes.\n112.\tThe conduct of Israel meets with less and less understanding. But unfortunately, that conduct continues to be characterized by undiminished aggressiveness, as confirmed again by its recent retaliatory military terrorist acts. All this shows that in actual fact the actions of Israel are not motivated by concern for its own security. For it is quite clear that within its pre-war boundaries, and through peace and co-operation with its neighbors, Israel could obtain the maximum guarantees for its security. These actions are, rather, the fruit of a dangerous ambition to retain territories wrested from the Arabs by force and to deprive the Arab people of Palestine of their legitimate rights forever. The current session of the General Assembly offers a chance to make a decisive effort to overcome the present situation and finally to offer the prospect of an effective solution to the crisis, with Security Council resolution 242(1967) constituting a confirmed and generally accepted basis for such a solution.\n113.\tThe divergence between what is spoken aloud and the actual situation with respect to decolonization and apartheid has not been narrowed in any way. Will anything really be done in the new climate in order to overcome resistance to the implementation of the decisions on the liberation of Portuguese colonies, of the Zimbabwe people, of Namibia and of other Territories? Will greater support and assistance be extended to the liberation movements?\n114.\tUnfortunately, the questions that I have asked are not new. And perhaps this already says much. No added weight should be given to doubts that the peace which now exists is too onerous and that the only purpose it serves is to have old aims achieved by new means.\n115.\tMy Government shares the concern at the intensification of international terrorism which threatens the lives of innocent persons and jeopardizes normal international relations and co-operation. Yugoslavia, whose citizens and representatives abroad have frequently been victims of threats, violence and terrorist acts, has been warning against such dangers for a number of years. Unfortunately, there was no appropriate response, although it must have been perfectly clear that such activities were directed not only against Yugoslavia and the safety of its citizens, but also against the citizens of countries in which the perpetrators of such acts often enjoy protection and often even direct support.\n116.\tThe time has come for the nature and causes of this disquieting phenomenon to be defined, and for co-ordinated action to be taken effectively to combat it. We believe that the United Nations is the most appropriate place for this problem to be dealt with. International co-operation and, above all, the willingness of Governments to fulfill the obligations deriving from international law and the Charter constitute a fundamental prerequisite for such action. The taking of innocent hostages, attacks against the machinery of international relations, and upon the trans-port facilities of countries not involved in military conflicts are all acts that we must condemn and towards whose eradication we must work. It is intolerable that under the pretext of democratic freedoms the defeated Fascist elements should be allowed to organize for the purpose of committing terrorist acts against independent countries.\n117.\tEven less can we allow the word \\\"terrorism\\\" to be applied to organized resistance against terror or used as a pretext to obstruct a justified and legitimate struggle which is inevitable when there are relations of subjection, domination and injustice in existence. In opposing terrorism we have always condemned individual acts of terror, convinced that they actually cause more harm to liberation movements by leading them astray and reducing the support they should receive in their just struggle. We would defeat the ends we seek if the condemnation and repression of international terrorism were to benefit those who practice the terrorism of colonization or mass reprisals against entire peoples, since it is this type of action which is the primary source of despair and terrorism against individuals.\n118.\tThe improvement of conditions in Europe is a significant and favorable factor in the present world situation. However, this process is being hampered by trends seeking to perpetuate the existing division of the European continent into blocs and to divorce European detente from the world context. The conference on European security and co-operation will prove to be of great significance if it reverses this trend. Europe cannot be an island of peace and detente in a turbulent sea of upheaval and conflict. Therefore, while endeavoring to establish relations that would guarantee to all European countries the right to develop independently irrespective of size, geographic position or socio-political system and the possibility of doing so, Europe must be one component of an identical process throughout the world. Otherwise, sooner or later Europe would suffer the reverberations of conflicts and antagonisms in other parts of the world.\n119.\tThe results of the European conference should provide fresh incentives and create new possibilities for co-operation in the Balkans, where European contradictions have always manifested themselves in an intensified form. European detente also implies the recognition of the intimate link between Europe and the Mediterranean, a link which can no longer be denied. One of the initiatives flowing from this relationship has been undertaken by the non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean. This initiative remains open to all nations sharing the same concern and having the same needs.\n120.\tDespite certain initial achievements in the field of disarmament and in spite of bilateral agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, the arms race has not ended. Nothing can diminish the role and the responsibility of the United Nations as the body most directly concerned with disarmament, because solutions affecting all countries in fact the entire world should not be sought or prepared outside the world Organization. For that reason Yugoslavia supports the convening of a world disarmament conference with the equitable participation of all States in all phases of its preparation.\n121.\tThe third session of UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment have clearly shown that there are more important issues of concern to mankind and have shown to what extent the manufacture and use of modern weapons undermine the material and even the biological existence of man.\n122.\tIn the field of economic relations the main problems have now been pinpointed and the avenues to their solution clearly defined. Unfortunately, the distance between the definition of a problem and its solution is sometimes very great. The third session of UNCTAD did not achieve the expected results. Solutions must be sought at the broadest international level. I am thinking particularly of the need to reform the world monetary and trade systems. This does not, of course, imply that other outstanding issues have lost their importance-above all the urgent problems relating to access to the markets of developed countries, international financing, shipping, and so on. However, if we attach specific importance to the monetary and trade problems it is because they constitute the touchstone of the capacity of the international community to adopt a new system which should be universal and serve, the interests of all the members of the international community, regardless of differences in levels of economic development and socio-economic systems.\n123.\tBecause we believe in the universality of this world Organization, my country, in response to the desire of the Government of Bangladesh, has actively supported its application for membership in the United Nations. We consider it unquestionable that the new independent, sovereign and peaceful State of Bangladesh meets the criteria and fulfills the conditions laid down by the Charter for the admission of new Members. My Government sincerely believes that the admission of Bangladesh to membership in the world Organization at the present session would greatly contribute both to the independence and international status of that State and to the stabilization of international relations in that part of Asia.\n124.\tThe democratization of international relations is one of the most important requirements of the contemporary world, and in this regard the United Nations constitutes a lever of vital importance. The effectiveness of the Organization will, to a large extent, depend on how its Member States succeed in co-ordinating our essentially common interests, regardless of how irreconcilable those interests may sometimes appear. Any analysis must inevitably confirm the fact that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter provide even today a sound basis for the solution of the complex set of economic, social, political, humanitarian and other issues of the present-day world.\n125.\tBasically, conflicts between States are the result of a failure to solve social contradictions within the States themselves. Peace is a prerequisite for social progress; but social progress itself is a prerequisite for peace. International conditions should not restrict or impede possibilities for any country's domestic development or national emancipation. There can be no such thing as peace if it is a peace which perpetuates the external obstacles to independent internal progress.\n126.\tThe freedom of nations and the freedom of the individual are one and the same aspiration. The demand by man to participate in social progress and the demand of countries to take part in world affairs really merge into one.\nYugoslavia believes in this and it is for that reason that we are exerting every effort towards that end.\n127.\tThe worth of our Organization will be measured by its ability to assist peoples and nations to progress in peace and freedom towards the goals that they cannot and will not give up.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues who have spoken before me in extending to you my delegation's warmest congratulations upon your election as President of this session of the Assembly.\n61.\tThe participation of my delegation in the present general debate will be limited to a discussion of the situation in the waters around Iceland. A dangerous situation exists now in that part of the world which I feel should be brought to the attention of the General Assembly. I shall discuss that situation first specifically and then in the wider framework of the law of the sea in general, particularly in light of the preparations being made for the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The general implications of this specific case will then be readily realized.\n62.\tLet me first describe the situation in the seas surrounding Iceland.\n63.\tThe plain fact is that on 1 September 1972, the fishery limits off Iceland were extended to 50 miles, as I had the honor to announce from this rostrum a year ago [1945th meeting]. For more than a year now efforts have been made to reach a practical solution of the problems with which the trawler industries of the nations most concerned have been faced in this connexion. On that basis an agreement was concluded on 7 September 1972 between Belgium and Iceland, whereby a specific number of Belgian trawlers have been licensed by Iceland to fish until 1 June 1974, during specified periods in certain areas inside the new limits. This is a practical arrangement which, under the circumstances, proved to constitute an acceptable solution of the problems involved. Similar arrangements have been made in the case of fishing vessels from the Faeroe islands.\n64.\tDiscussions with the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany are still in progress, but no solution has been found. Only one Member of the United Nations -the United Kingdom-has continued to send fishing vessels inside the limits in violation of Icelandic laws and regulations, and serious incidents have already occurred. These activities are connected with an indication of interim measures of protection, dated 17 August 1972. issued by the International Court of Justice,  which purports to authorize British trawlers to catch 170,000 tons of fish annually in the Icelandic area. The United Kingdom has in effect sought to institute proceedings before the Court on the basis of an Exchange of Notes of 1961. \n65.\tThe Government of Iceland already, on 31 August 1971, informed the Government of the United Kingdom that it considered the acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction under the 1961 agreement to have achieved its objective and that the agreement was consequently terminated. This view was subsequently confirmed by a unanimous vote of the Parliament of Iceland, the Althing. In order to clarify the position I wish, with your permission, Mr. President, to read to the Assembly the text of the Icelandic aide-memoire of 31 August 1971, which was transmitted to the Government of the United Kingdom. It reads as follows:\n\\\"On 11 March 1961 the Governments of Iceland and the United Kingdom exchanged Notes for the settlement of the fisheries dispute between the two countries, which had its origin in the extension of Iceland's fishery limits effected in 1958. In that Exchange of Notes it was stated:\n\\\" \\\"The Icelandic Government will continue to work for the implementation of the Althing Resolution of 5 May 1959 regarding the extension of fisheries jurisdiction around Iceland, but shall give to the United Kingdom Government six months' notice of such extension and, in case of a dispute in relation to such extension, the matter shall, at the request of either party, be referred to the International Court of Justice.'\n\\\"In the opinion of the Icelandic Government, which is continuing to work for the implementation of the Althing Resolution in the light of increased knowledge and other developments that have occurred since that Exchange of Notes, the object and purpose of the provisions for recourse to judicial settlement of certain matters envisaged in the passage quoted above have been fully achieved. In the period of ten years which has elapsed, the United Kingdom Government enjoyed the benefit of the Icelandic Government's policy to the effect that further extension of the limits of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction would be placed in abeyance for a reasonable and equitable period. Continuation of that policy by the Icelandic Government, in the light of intervening scientific and economic evolution (including the ever greater threat of increased diversion of highly developed fishing effort to the Icelandic area) has become excessively onerous and unacceptable, and is harmful to the maintenance of the resources of the sea on which the livelihood of the Icelandic people depends.\n\\\"In order to strengthen the measures of protection essential to safeguard the vital interests of the Icelandic people in the seas surrounding its coasts, the Government of Iceland now finds it essential to extend further the zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction around its coasts to include the areas of sea covering the continental shelf. It is contemplated that the new limits, the precise boundaries of which will be furnished at a later date, will enter into force not later than 1 September 1972.\n\\\"Having regard to the foregoing, the Government of Iceland is prepared, on the basis of the discussions which have already taken place in London, that representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Iceland should meet for the purpose of achieving a practical solution of the problems involved.\\\" \n66.\tThese arguments were reiterated in an aide-memoire of 24 February 1972,  with which was enclosed a memorandum entitled \\\"Fisheries Jurisdiction in Iceland\\\", where the considerations which led the Government of Iceland to issue the new regulations were set forth. That memorandum has been distributed to all States Members of the United Nations.\n67.\tOn 14 April 1972, the Registrar of the International Court of Justice informed me that an application had been filed by the United Kingdom Government in the Registry of the Court instituting proceedings against Iceland on the basis of the Exchange of Notes of 1961, to which I have already referred.\n68.\tIn reply, I requested that a number of documents dealing with the background and termination of the agreement referred to and with the changed circumstances resulting from the ever-increasing exploitation of the fishery resources in the seas surrounding Iceland be brought to the attention of the Court. I stated that the danger which this entails for the Icelandic people necessitates further control by the Government of Iceland, the only coastal State concerned.\n69.\tIn my letter to the Court I also stated the views of my Government with regard to the Exchange of Notes on the basis of which proceedings before the Court were sought to be instituted. These views are the following.\n70. The 1961 Exchange of Notes took place under extremely difficult circumstances, when the British Royal Navy had been using force to oppose the 12-mile fishery limit established by the Icelandic Government in 1958. It constituted the settlement of that dispute, but the agreement it recorded was not of a permanent nature. The United Kingdom Government acknowledged the exceptional dependence of the Icelandic people upon coastal fisheries for their livelihood and economic development and recognized the 12-mile fishery zone, subject to an adjustment period of three years. Incidentally, the United Kingdom Government has since adopted a 12-mile fishery zone in British waters. The Icelandic Government, for its part, stated that it would continue to work for the implementation of the Althing resolution of 5 May 1959, regarding the extension of fisheries jurisdiction around Iceland, but would give to the United Kingdom Government six months' notice of such extension, with a possibility of recourse to the International Court of Justice in the event of a dispute in relation to such extension. Thus, the United Kingdom Government was given the opportunity of recourse to the Court should the Icelandic Government without warning further extend the limits immediately or in the near future.\n71.\tThe agreement by which that dispute was settled, and consequently the possibility of such recourse to the Court-to which the Government of Iceland has been consistently opposed as far as concerns disputes over the extent of its exclusive fisheries jurisdiction, as indeed the United Kingdom recognizes-was not of a permanent nature. In particular, an undertaking for judicial settlement cannot be considered to be of a permanent nature. There is nothing in that situation, or in any general rule of contemporary international law, to justify any other view.\n72.\tIn its aide-memoire of 31 August 1971, as I have already stated, the Government of Iceland, inter alia, gave to the United Kingdom Government 12 months' notice of its intention to extend the zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction around its coasts to include the areas of sea covering the continental shelf, the precise boundaries of which would be furnished later. It also expressed its willingness to explore possibilities for finding a practical solution to the problems with which the British trawler industry found itself faced. It was specifically stated that the new limits would enter into force not later than 1 September 1972. At the same time it was intimated that the object and purpose of the 1961 agreement had been fully achieved. The position of the Icelandic Government was reiterated in its aide-memoire of 24 February 1972, which again indicated that the 1961 Exchange of Notes was no longer applicable and was terminated. Copies of that aide-memoire were transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the Registrar of the International Court of Justice.\n73.\tAfter the termination of the agreement recorded in the Exchange of Notes of 1961 there was on 14 April 1972, when proceedings were sought to be instituted, no basis under the Statute for the Court to exercise jurisdiction in the case to which the United Kingdom refers.\n74.\tThe Government of Iceland, considering that the vital interests of the people of Iceland were involved, respectfully informed the Court that it was not willing to confer jurisdiction on the Court in any case involving the extent of the fishery limits of Iceland, including specifically the case sought to be instituted by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 14 April 1972. Having regard to the foregoing, no agent was appointed to represent the Government of Iceland.\n75.\tIt will be seen from the documents to which I have referred that the Government of Iceland does not agree that the International Court of Justice has jurisdiction in the case that the United Kingdom has sought to institute. Nor does my Government consider that the International Court is competent to assess what size of catch might be taken from Icelandic waters by British trawlers without endangering fish stocks in an area over which the Government of Iceland has declared its sovereign rights for fishery purposes. That is a matter for negotiations between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Iceland, and my Government is willing, as I have stated repeatedly, to continue efforts to bring such negotiations to a successful conclusion. Discussions between the representatives of the two Governments will continue next week.\n76.\tI now want to refer to one argument which has been advanced in this matter, namely that the Government of Iceland should not have extended the fishery limits but should have waited for the holding of the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea before doing so. In that connexion I want, to emphasize that my Government has in effect been waiting for almost 25 years for such a solution. It was at this Assembly in 1949 that the delegation of Iceland successfully proposed that the entire body of law of the sea should be taken up for study by the International Law Commission.  That study led to the First and Second United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 respectively x and, although it was not possible there to reach a solution concerning the extent of coastal jurisdiction, it is now hoped that the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea will achieve such results. We most certainly hope so. When we consider that the preparatory work for the Conference shows that an overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations already accepts the basic principle that fishery limits should be based on relevant local considerations up to a reasonable extent from the coast, the end may very well be in sight. But it is not certain when that task will be completed. It may still take several years- before a convention is concluded, signed and ratified by a sufficient number of States to enter into effect.\n77.\tIn the meantime the Icelandic nation is faced with the fact that its only natural resources may be destroyed by foreign fishing. A working group established by the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has reached the conclusion that the cod fisheries in the North Atlantic should be reduced by 50 per cent. This is a question of life or death. Our conclusion was and is that we could not wait any longer. We could not just sit idly by and watch the collapse of our economy. No accusations of selfishness or of unilateral action can change that fact. Let us all in this Assembly be aware of the fact that rigid rules based on the protection of the interests of distant-water fishing nations in utilizing for themselves the coastal fishery resources of other countries are now no longer sacrosanct. On the contrary, they are obsolete.\n78.\tAs far as the International Court of Justice is concerned, I will say that its proper role in the United Nations system is extremely valuable. However, its jurisdiction is limited to cases where consent for jurisdiction has been given and exists. The consent of Iceland to the Court's jurisdiction with regard to fishery limits was given under extremely difficult circumstances. That consent has been terminated and no longer exists.\n79.\tIn its order concerning interim measures of protection, the Court states that, on a request for such measures, the Court need not, before indicating them, finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case, although it ought not to act under Article 41 of the Statute if the absence of jurisdiction on the merits is manifest.\n80.\tMy Government's view is that the absence of jurisdiction is manifest since its consent no longer existed when the proceedings were sought to be instituted.\n81.\tOne of the Judges of the International Court of Justice, Judge Padilla Nervo, reached the conclusion that the Court should not have indicated provisional measures since its jurisdiction had not been established. As to the merits, Judge Padilla Nervo said the following:\n\\\"The Government of Iceland in its information and documents sent to the Court, has given well-founded reasons and explanations of its sovereign right to extend its fisheries jurisdiction to the entire continental shelf area.\n\\\"The coastal fisheries in Iceland have always been the foundation of the country's economy.\n\\\"The coastal fisheries are the condition sine qua non for the Icelandic economy; without them the country would not have been habitable.\n\\\"Iceland rests on a platform or continental shelf whose outlines follow those of the country itself. In these shallow underwater terraces, ideal conditions are found for spawning areas and nursery grounds upon whose preservation and utilization the livelihood of the nation depends. It is increasingly being recognized that coastal fisheries are based on the special conditions prevailing in the coastal areas which provide the necessary environment for the fish stocks. The environment is an integral part of the natural resources of the coastal State.\n\\\"The continental shelf is really the platform of the country and must be considered to be a part of the country itself.\n\\\"The vital interests of the Icelandic people are therefore at stake. They must be protected.\n\\\"The priority position of the coastal State has then always been recognized through the system of fishery limits. In the past these limits nave to a great extent not been established with any regard to the interests of the coastal State. They owe their origin rather to the preponderant influence of distant-water fishery nations, who wished to fish as close as possible to the shores of other nations, frequently destroying one area and then proceeding to another.\n\\\"In a system of progressive development of international law the question of fishery limits has to be reconsidered in terms of the protection and utilization of coastal resources regardless of other considerations which apply to the extent of the territorial sea. The international community has increasingly recognized that the coastal fishery resources are to be considered as a part of the natural resources of the coastal State. The special situation of countries who are overwhelmingly dependent on coastal fisheries, was generally recognized at both Geneva Conferences in 1958 and 1960. Since then this view has found frequent expression both in the legislation of various countries and in important political statements. The course of events is decidedly progressing in this direction.\\\" \n82.\tIn conclusion I want to say, with all the conviction at my command, that our vital interests are at stake. We know that a great many nations represented here understand our views. Some of them have taken similar steps to safeguard their own coastal resources. Others have supported our action and are making their own preparations. I want to use this opportunity to thank them for their understanding of the necessity for the Icelandic nation to protect its very existence, its right to live, its right to cultivate its own garden.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like at the outset to extend to you, on behalf of the Greek delegation and on my own behalf, our warmest congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, which constitutes a well-deserved tribute to your personal ability as a distinguished statesman and to your country, with which Greece maintains relations of sincere friendship.\n141.\tPermit me also, Mr. President, to express to your eminent predecessor, Mr. Malik, our deep appreciation for the competent and effective manner in which he carried out his arduous task during a difficult session which was fraught with complex problems.\n142.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General and to thank him for his untiring zeal in the service of world peace.\n143.\tThe year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has been marked with most important events, which are destined to affect profoundly international relations in the near future.\n144.\tThe ratification of treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with the Soviet Union and with Poland, the visits of the President of the United States of America to Peking and Moscow and the agreements signed on that occasion, the readjustment of the policy of the great Powers to present-world realities, President Nixon's initiative to bring the Viet-Nam war to an equitable and democratic solution in sum, the detente which is emerging on the international horizon all are events of the greatest importance.\n145.\tNevertheless, as is pointed out by our Secretary- General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:\n.. we should not be too euphoric about this development since previous post-war indications of detente failed to materialize into a durable relaxation of international tensions.\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. l.]\n146.\tIndeed, the international community has on many occasions in the past witnessed periods of euphoria only to discover a little later, to its regret, that the detente which appeared to be dawning was only a fortuitous accident if not a mere expedient. Since peace is not a simple pause in the conflicts between great Powers, the international community, and more particularly small countries, cannot feel free from threat and calmly turn to the search for a better life as long as our world can become overnight again a battleground where, on one pretext or another, the interests of the super-Powers are pitted against one another.\n147.\tWe certainly do not question the special responsibilities of the great Powers for the maintenance of international peace and security. None the less, we fully agree with the Secretary-General that the idea of maintaining peace and security in the world by means of an arrangement of great Powers is outdated, belonging rather to the political concepts of the nineteenth century. In this context, I should like to associate myself fully with the remarks made a year go by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France that\n\\\"... refusing to accept any kind of hegemony is the best contribution that a country can make to the birth of a truly international community.\\\" \n148.\tIt is certainly true that the activity of the United Nations has not always responded to the hopes of our peoples and that the goals that we set at the outset still remain partly in the realm of aspirations. World public opinion, which expected perhaps too much from the United Nations, seems to attribute to us the role of the chorus in Greek tragedies which bewails the sad fate of mortals always at the mercy of the all-powerful Olympians.\n149.\tBut since the United Nations is merely the reflection of its membership, its successes or failures are the responsibility of all its Member States, and especially of the great Powers which have been attributed special prerogatives by the Charter.\n150.\tWe feel that despite its deficiencies and imperfections we would be exaggerating if we were to maintain that our Organization, even in its present structure, is not able to deal more adequately with the problems of these difficult times. Indeed, we think that the ineffectiveness of the United Nations is due more to a lack of political will on the part of its Members to respect and abide by the principles to which they have subscribed, rather than to any institutional structural imperfections.\n151.\tDespite a number of encouraging signs, peace continues to be absent in certain regions of the world. Thus, the situation in the Middle East still remains a constant source of anxiety and disquiet. The likelihood of a global settlement appears very remote. Five years have already elapsed since the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)-five years of continuous tension, bloody incidents and, since August 1970, a precarious cease-fire. This protracted immobility is certainly not conducive to healing the open wounds. However, it is inconceivable that the Middle East should find itself mired indefinitely in a state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\".\n152. Greece, whose traditional bonds of friendship with the peoples of this region date well back in history and which wishes to see them living in peace and security, continues to believe that the resolution 242 (1967) provides an equitable basis for bringing about a peace settlement in the area, covering all the disputes which separate the parties concerned. In keeping with the spirit and the letter of this resolution, the parties to the dispute should be able to find a workable solution allowing them to lead a fruitful existence in peace and security.\n153.\tWe therefore urge the parties to the conflict, whose true interests should not be confused with their wishes, to demonstrate a spirit of compromise and realism and, taking advantage of the present climate of detente and the meritorious efforts of the Secretary-General and Mr. Jarring, to move courageously towards a lasting settlement in accordance with the dictates of peace and equity.\n154.\tWith regard to the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, I should like to make a few brief remarks concerning another problem for which a solution has yet to be found, namely, the problem of Cyprus. The renewal of talks between the two communities in an atmosphere of calm, with the participation of two constitutional experts -a Greek and a Turk- as well as with the valuable assistance of the personal representative of the Secretary-General, is an encouraging and promising development.\n155.\tGreece, abiding as it does by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and dedicated as it is to the cause of peace and international co-operation, believes that the enlarged inter communal talks are the most expedient, if not the sole remaining, means to arrive at an acceptable solution of the constitutional difficulties that persist on the island.\n156.\tIt is now up to the two negotiators to apply themselves, in a spirit of goodwill, to the search for a system of government that would enable the inhabitants of Cyprus to live peacefully within the framework of an independent, sovereign and unitary State. Admittedly, the road ahead will not be a short one, and the obstacles to be overcome are not easy. The interested parties must therefore show a great deal of perseverance and realism in order to arrive at an equitable and workable solution,\n157.\tOn this occasion it is my pleasant duty to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General as well as to all those who have contributed to this encouraging development in Cyprus, and to express at the same time our appreciation to the countries which, in a spirit of international solidarity, permit, either in the form of military units or in the form of voluntary contributions, peace-keeping operations in Cyprus to continue.\n158.\tSpeaking of trouble spots, one cannot overlook the situation in IndoChina, in Viet-Nam, which, although it does not appear on the agenda of the General Assembly, is nevertheless a subject of our concern. The continuing suffering and loss of human life cannot but trouble the conscience of all peace-loving people. We must nevertheless in all good faith recognize that the United States of America has on many occasions taken concrete measures for military disengagement and has submitted proposals such as to assure the VietNamese people of the exercise of their right to self-determination without outside interference. It would not, therefore, be unreasonable, we feel, to expect that Hanoi would take similar measures, instead of making sterile and baseless accusations against the party that has scrupulously respected its announced calendar, thus prolonging the suffering of the Vietnamese people.\n159.\tIn passing from Asia to southern Africa, I should like once again to declare that Greece, which since the creation of the United Nations has been in the vanguard of those who have resolutely and unfailingly fought for the recognition of the right of peoples to self-determination and for the elimination of racial discrimination, remains ready to help in seeking a just and realistic solution of these problems in conformity with the principles and ideals that we uphold.\n160.\tIn speaking of the international order, my delegation wishes to stress that in view of the alarming resurgence of acts of terrorism, it is necessary scrupulously to implement the relevant provisions of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, unanimously adopted by the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2625 (XXV)], and more particularly the provisions setting out the duties incumbent upon all States in cases of international terrorism.\n161.\tAt the same time, it would be useful to undertake, as has been suggested by our Secretary-General, a thorough analysis of this problem in order to provide the necessary remedy.\n162.\tIn this respect, I wish to reiterate that my delegation unreservedly supports the provisions of the said Declaration and would stress the importance that we attach to its full implementation by all nations of the world,\n163.\tAs the question of the strengthening of international security is again on the agenda of this session, I should like to take this opportunity to state that Greece, a peace-loving country which has on many occasions been the victim of acts of aggression, is prepared, as in the past, to contribute in an active and positive manner, to all sincere efforts aimed at effectively strengthening international security.\n164.\tAt the same time Greece declares itself ready to participate in the conference on security and co-operation in Europe, as soon as the preliminary talks, in which it is taking an active part, have been concluded.\n165.\tOn the other hand, firmly attached as it is to the principles of Article 2 of the Charter, the Greek Government has for some years now been sincerely endeavoring to improve its relations with countries of different political, economic and social systems, and more particularly with neighboring States. It should also be pointed out in this connexion that Greece has recently established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.\n166.\tWe are gratified over the improvement of the political climate in the Balkan peninsula, and we should like to reaffirm our intention to pursue this policy further on the basis of strict reciprocity. We feel that there are ample opportunities for effective co-operation among the Balkan States in order to serve their common interests.\n167.\tMy delegation cannot conceal its disappointment, probably shared by the great majority of Member States, in noting that our Organization has still not been able to establish machinery to fulfill its fundamental task, namely, peace-keeping. No one can deny in the light of past experience, the usefulness and value of peace-keeping operations.\n168.\tWe feel that the time has come to abandon improvisation of such operations and to proceed to the formulation of a general agreement covering all aspects of the problem so that the United Nations may become an effective instrument for world peace,\n169.\tHaving always been actively interested in peacekeeping operations undertaken by our Organization, especially in the case of peace-keeping operations in Cyprus, towards whose success Greece has contributed substantially both materially and morally, we are prepared to work together with the other Member States to set up machinery which would enable our Organization properly to fulfill this fundamental task entrusted to it.\n170.\tSince peace is irreconcilable with poverty and ignorance, we can hardly overemphasize the duty incumbent upon us all to take all possible steps to contribute effectively to the economic and technological progress of the developing countries.\n171.\tTechnical progress, which provides tremendous possibilities for accelerating economic development, has only widened the gap between industrially developed countries and the less privileged ones. If we wish to avoid a world split into two antagonistic camps, the rich countries and the poor ones, the north and the south, we must show constructive solidarity and undertake challenging initiatives. Peace cannot be assured as long as the majority of mankind lives in despair and want.\n172.\tEurope in particular must understand that it will win the friendship of the peoples of the south hemisphere only to the extent that it shares with them the concern for their economic, social and humanitarian future.\n"

        "file_text": "It is customary at this time of the year for this glass and steel palace in Manhattan to play host to the meetings of special envoys who come from the four corners of the world and to offer the opportunity to international public opinion to hear speeches setting forth the positions of Governments on the economic and political problems of mankind.\n92.\tAs special envoy of General Mobutu Sese Seko, I come to this rostrum of the United Nations and before this unique forum to present the views and considerations of the Popular Movement of the Revolution, our great national political party, and the National Executive Council of the Republic of Zaire.\n93.\tA certain tradition has been established in this hall placing political problems before economic problems, and especially development problems. In the Republic of Zaire, where a great revolution is occurring, we place the problems of development, and especially of our economic revolution, in the forefront.\n94.\tWhatever the degree of political maturity of a people, its effective independence can be expressed only by the control of its economy.\n95.\tFor us, nations of the third world, the Bandung Conference  hurled a challenge to the colonial system. Thus, from the Bandung Conference to the Georgetown Conference,  our various States have all fallen prey and will continue to fall prey to all kinds of disturbances as long as they are not masters of their own economies. To remedy this situation, the international community took the initiative in 1964 in Geneva of starting round-table negotiations to denounce the plundering of our wealth.\n96.\tDespite an abundant amount of literature disseminated all over the world on the danger represented by the gap between the so-called developing countries and the so-called developed countries and despite negotiations within specialized bodies, no solution seems likely to be achieved to fill this gap. Can one talk of international peace when over two thirds of mankind languish in poverty? There is not the slightest doubt that the road to lasting peace in a community is through the solution of economic problems.\n97.\tThe gap which separates the economies of the developed countries in the Republic of Zaire we call them \\\"the equipped countries\\\" from those of under-equipped, or underdeveloped, countries comes from the bad structure of the international economy. The result is that on the one hand some cannot enjoy the advantages of the present international division of labor and on the other hand international assistance gives rise to problems which do not seem to be finding proper solutions in the present state of affairs.\n98.\tTo prevent delays in this fight against under-equipment as in the solution of important problems of structure in the international economic system of today, the Republic of Zaire has decided to count above all on its resources and secondly on all-round co-operation with all other peoples, taking into account its own interests. Zaire is convinced that the reform of the structures of the international economy can be achieved, not around a conference table, but rather through events resulting from the internal dynamics of these structures. Aware of this situation, my country has embarked upon a policy of reform of its economic structures. Through these reforms the Zaire economy will first have to be oriented towards the internal market, and then it will have to be able to make possible economic integration, and the agreements which the Republic of Zaire has just concluded with some African countries prove our political will to achieve regional economic integration.\n99.\tHere I should like to point out that, instead of merely abandoning its project for the construction of the Inga hydro-electric dam, which had not aroused any interest on the part of equipped countries and the international bodies approached for financing it, the Republic of Zaire decided to build it with its own resources, come what may. It was only when this work was quite advanced that some foreign interests did come forward to co-operate with us. In a few weeks we shall inaugurate one of the greatest hydro-electric dams in the world, whose construction was made possible solely due to our own will.\n100.\tI must also point out the important economic agreements concluded by two African countries whose independence in the matter of political and economic decisions is clear for all to see. I have in mind the Republic of Zaire and the Republic of Guinea. These agreements were reached in Conakry between President Ahmed Sekou Toure and General Mobutu Sese Seko during the fraternal and unforgettable visit which our national leader paid to the African land of Guinea. This proves that the economic integration of the under-equipped countries is predicated, above all, on their own will.\n101.\tThe Republic of Zaire, unfortunately, knows that, if it is rare for industrialized countries to agree even after marathon negotiations, it is just as rare for under-equipped countries to achieve a harmonization of their views on matters of common, albeit vital, interest and here we can only blame ourselves.\n102.\tWe must have the courage to recognize that political will alone is not sufficient for achieving this integration. Under-equipped countries further require the technological and financial co-operation of the equipped countries, although this co-operation must take into account the imperatives and objectives freely chosen by the under- equipped countries.\n103.\tThe reform of the economic structures of under- equipped countries and the harmonization of their economic policies are necessary conditions for achieving their economic integration.\n104.\tThe most remarkable event of recent times is the international monetary crisis, whose effects continue to be felt in economic relations among States. You will agree with me that the international monetary crisis is but the reflection of a deficiency of the structures of the international monetary system; and, in the view of the Zaire delegation, this system must be revised so as to take into account economic realities which have been radically altered since the end of the last World War. One cannot, without contradicting history, rely upon the economic prosperity of a few States to build up a system of payments which would encompass all nations. The international monetary system must not any longer be directly tied to the monetary systems of a few States, no matter what their economic power. Therefore we are aware of the fact that the management of the international monetary system, a renovated system, must be entrusted to the will of the international community. For this the International Monetary Fund will have to be profoundly altered in its structure and its statutes, so that sooner or later the management of that body will be organized so as to enable it to play the role of a central bank on the national level.\n105.\tThe international division of labor as revised, the reformed international monetary system and the international economy will be able to make a new st-art on a solid, sound and just basis. As long as there is no reform of the structures of the whole international economic system, we are convinced, fluctuations will continue to affect inter-State relations, and the efforts of States and international organizations to remedy this state of affairs will always fall short of the mark.\n106.\tNo matter what influence the international situation may have on the results of the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago, Chile, especially on trade, the under-equipped countries may quite justly speak of their disappointment in view of the few concessions made b^ equipped countries in fields where they have a monopoly. Since the hopes of the under-equipped countries to improve their trade balance have again been dashed, we wonder to what extent we can still rely on the goodwill of the equipped countries to solve the problems arising from time to time in the international economy.\n107.\tWe must admit that one of the most important matters taken up in UNCTAD was the important problem of the stabilization of primary commodity prices. How is it possible to conceive that raw materials, upon which the economy of almost all, if not all, under-equipped countries depend, should be the object of speculation on the part of a few businessmen in some well-known markets? To say that the speculation affects only tiny or even non-existent amounts confirms the justifiable disappointment of the under-equipped countries. In other words, in the world everything happens as if some countries had only one right, that of producing, and others had the right to buy at the price which they themselves determine or, even worse, at a price determined by a few speculators. Worst of all is the fact that these raw materials bought at prices which are eternally fluctuating serve to manufacture finished goods which are then resold to countries producing raw materials, that is to say, the under-equipped countries, at excessively high prices.\n108. In view of this fact, the Republic of Zaire has solemnly expressed its determination not to be any longer a reservoir of raw materials which can be drawn on at will. Even in the field of international assistance, which in principle is supposed to make up the shortcomings of international trade, the hopes of the under-equipped countries have again been dashed. Indeed, to attain the objectives of the Second Development Decade, the United Nations had decided that this year at the latest the equipped countries would make available to the under-equipped countries 1 per cent of their gross national product, of which 0.7 per cent would be represented by public assistance. This decision has practically remained a dead letter, and to the very small extent that it has been put into effect it has been on conditions which are in any case unacceptable to Zaire.\n109. With regard to the conditions in which international assistance is granted to under-equipped countries, it has constantly been repeated from this rostrum that the equipped countries which do the lending must take into account the economic difficulties of the under-equipped countries in the matter of the reimbursement of the loans. The growing burden of foreign debt of the under-equipped countries and the constant desire of equipped countries to profit from their assistance face the former with a very difficult choice which certainly does not foster the development of the international economy.\n110. Thus, President Mobutu Sese Seko, speaking before the First Congress of the Popular Movement of the Revolution, offered the following thoughts to the world:\n\\\"In our under-equipped countries, we welcome technical assistants who are paid totally or partially by the donor countries but whose salaries are either spent or saved in rich countries and even promote a black market in our currencies.\n\\\"The granting of fellowships to our young people who take courses in industrialized countries is worth while to the extent that the student comes back with more solid knowledge. But the expenses connected with this form of assistance are incurred in the donor country and redound to its benefit. Moreover, most of the time our students come back to us having completely lost their sense of identity.\n\\\"The word 'assistance' is also used when, in order to enable us to buy manufactured goods, we are granted purchasing credits. But who gains by that? Obviously the exporting firms and the banks which make possible the financing-but never the consumer country, because its foreign debt is only increased by this.\\\"\n111.\tTherefore, these examples compel the Republic of Zaire to draw some bitter conclusions, and this has led us to radicalize our economic revolution.\n112.\tOf course, we know that, after all, this is a human problem. How can one expect qf a rich man that he will help you so that you may attain his status? That is an aberration.\n113.\tWe have said in Zaire that we shall be the architects of our own development. We shall reach our economic objectives in accordance with our own will and our own resources and relying solely upon our own efforts. Foreign assistance will be used as a stopgap only when absolutely necessary, but we shall do everything in our power to see to it that in this process of economic revolution we shall be able to do without this stopgap.\n114.\tThese are the political and economic realities of the world. In Zaire, under the dynamic leadership of Mobutu Sese Seko, we have decided to play our part, and we declare this solemnly in this hall, in this Organization, which is designed to ensure the well-being and happiness of mankind.\n115.\tTo you international economists who attach importance to the gross national product in drawing up the lists of developing countries, we say, in Zaire, with President Mobutu Sese Seko, that we attach more importance to per capita national happiness.\n116.\tThe seas and oceans constitute huge reserves of raw materials and of mineral, biological and energy sources. Their exploration is proceeding favorably and their exploitation will be under way quite soon.\n117.\tIn view of these new possibilities, a part of international opinion has some legitimate questions. Who will profit from these new resources? The answer is obvious. The same people: the rich, the strong, those who have great resources material, financial or human unless an urgent and universally accepted solution is found within the framework of a renovated law of the sea. We all know that the sudden discovery of a rich under-sea deposit of manganese, copper or oil would certainly have a strong influence on the prices of these ores derived from the land.\n118.\tThat is why, in New York as in Geneva, the delegation of Zaire is positively studying the question of finding a new law of the sea for the international community.\n119.\tThe sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction have quite correctly been declared to be the common heritage of mankind. This principle will ensure free access, rational and balanced exploitation, and the equitable distribution of the under-sea resources of the international zone.\n120.\t\\\"Produce at all costs\\\": that is the motto of the developed countries. And that is the source of pollution. Therefore we wonder whether it is necessary to have innumerable factories if their chimneys are going to pour our toxic products on us day after day. I have been told that in one of the largest cities in the world the mere fact of breathing is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. I have also been told that in the same large city the hearing of the inhabitants is progressively affected after 25 years of age and that mental troubles caused by environ-mental assault progressively destroy the individual by acting on his psyche and his organism.\n121.\tIt seems to me that these horrible facts should arouse the universal conscience to the urgency of finding a solution to the problems of the environment.\n122.\tThe under-equipped countries are lucky to be able in their progressive industrialization, to take this important element into account.\n123.\tWe know that in your super-industrialized societies, you have works of art, your monuments, your cathedrals, your castles.\n124.\tIn the Republic of Zaire we say that we have our monuments which are masterpieces of nature. These are our rivers, our mountains, our volcanoes, our lakes, our plains, our animals.\n125.\tWe say, with our President, that in view of the degree of pollution of industrial societies, we might one day become the last refuge of nature in its natural state.\n126.\tWe have spoken of the economic aspects of the contemporary world. And this is no accident. This is an attitude which reflects the major concerns of the Republic of Zaire, which are marked by a historical truth: there is no real political independence without economic independence.\n127.\tWe must now speak up about the political problems of our day, and the first is international peace and security. My delegation is happy to recognize the efforts made in the world in the field of international peace and security since the end of the last session of the General Assembly.\n128.\tWe followed with great interest and attention the journeys of the President of the United States to China, the Soviet Union and Poland.\n129.\tWe consider that these initiatives which promote the convening of a conference on European security should be encouraged by the United Nations.\n130.\tWe think that the signing of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin on 3 September 1971 is an important step in the process of detente in Europe.\n131.\tDespite the optimism which seems to pervade inter-national relations within an atmosphere of a relative detente, we cannot shut our eyes to the ominous developments of the Middle East tragedy. We know, we must recognize, that this problem remains unchanged and is a matter of great concern.\n132.\tThe Republic of Zaire, which unfortunately from the very first hours of its independence knew the horrors of internecine warfare, can only deplore the loss of human life.\n133.\tWe sincerely pray that one day peace and harmony will prevail in that part of the world.\n134.\tOn 22 November 1967, after negotiations which lasted more than a whole night, a resolution was adopted by the Security Council. This resolution, 242 (1967), had the advantage not only of establishing a satisfactory balance, but also, and especially, of meeting with the agreement of all the parties concerned. Why do we then not recommend that it be fully and faithfully applied? In any case, that is the sincere wish of my country.\n135.\tAs in the case of the Middle East we deplore the loss of human life in the Indochinese peninsula. We hope that one day it will be possible to say that the man who advanced the idea of homo homini lupus did not translate or reflect the historical reality of mankind. And yet here again political will is necessary. The Paris Conference represents a hope. International public opinion is entitled to expect that the negotiators of the avenue Kleber will one day translate this hope into fact. International public opinion is also entitled to expect that all countries will bend every effort to help find a final solution to the problem of the peninsula.\n136.\tTo speak of an easing of tensions is also to speak of disarmament. General and complete disarmament to us is synonymous with the strengthening of peace and security in the world. Men have perfected their technology in the manufacture of weapons of war to such an extent that a world war today would be a catastrophe for mankind.\n137.\tThis bitter statement puts me in mind of the well-known sentence of President Kennedy expressing a harsh truth: \\\"Mankind will have to put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind.\\\"\n138.\tOn the other hand, by disarming and by renouncing the manufacture of nuclear weapons new funds would be freed which might usefully be employed to allay the sufferings of mankind.\n139.\tAnother matter of concern, and certainly the most important, is that of decolonization. Colonialism is-and Portugal knows it-a denial of democratic principles and fundamental rights which must govern all men in all latitudes, in keeping with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and the just and honest expression of universal conscience as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)].\n140.\tBut there are still people who are deaf because of selfish and sordid interests and who refuse to decolonize and therefore place themselves outside the pale of the international community and defy it. Even better, these deaf people are practicing subtle and systematic genocide against the peoples of African territories still under their domination.\n141.\tThat is why, since there are no other ways of obtaining the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) by Portugal, the natural course of events and of history have led the international community in general and the United Nations in particular to recognize the legitimacy of the struggle led by the liberation movements in Angola, Guinea (Bissau) and Mozambique.\n142.\tThe United Nations also has an effective role to play in ensuring the accession to independence of still colonized peoples. Posterity will judge the effectiveness of the acts of the international Organization in the field of decolonization.\n143.\tThe Republic of Zaire considers th.n the States Members of our Organization should refrain from any act which might be interpreted as assistance to Portugal in the pursuit of its anachronistic and shameless policy.\n144.\tWe must draw the attention of the partners of Portugal to the negative and prejudicial effect on the cause of African progress of economic and military co-operation with that country which obstinately continues to pursue a retrograde policy of colonial oppression.\n145.\tIn view of this alarming situation my country appeals to the universal conscience so that all free and justice-loving States will do everything in their power to compel the Lisbon leaders to comply with resolution 1514 (XV).\n146.\tAs far as we are concerned, and in view of the persistent refusal of Portugal to negotiate with the nationalists with which it is fighting, we could not possibly abandon our unconditional support for the freedom fighters. As the Assembly knows, it was on the initiative of Presidents Mobutu Sese Seko and Ngouabi that the reconciliation between the two liberation movements, of Angola was made possible in order to unite their forces in the face of the common enemy, colonialist Portugal.\n147.\tAnother problem of decolonization is that of the Zimbabwe people, victims of the oppression of a few white racist settlers.\n148.\tSince 24 November 1971, international public opinion has been informed of the \\\"Anglo-Rhodesian Agreements\\\" or rather the \\\"proposals for a settlement\\\" of the Rhodesian question.\n149.\tToday we know what unanimous answer the Zimbabwe people reserved for these proposals. We did not have to await the results of the investigation by Lord Pearce to know the opinion of Zimbabwe people concerning its future. This categorical \\\"No\\\" could have been foreseen. It has but one meaning-general disapproval of the illegal situation created in Zimbabwe, so-called Rhodesia, after 11 November 1965.\n150.\tThe aspiration to freedom and independence among all peoples is part of an irreversible movement of history which nothing can arrest. Through its wholesale rejection of the so-called proposals for settlement, the Zimbabwe people has shown its determination to fight for national independence. The Zimbabwe people itself clarified matters. We think now that the British Government has no alternative but to intervene more effectively with a view to restoring the usurped rights of the majority people of Zimbabwe.\n151.\tI could not conclude this consideration of the problems of decolonization without mentioning the painful problem of apartheid. The only crime committed by the Africans herded into their wretched reservations and ghettos is that they have a black skin.\n152.\tUniversal civilization, I am sure you will agree, is something that all peoples have contributed to with their own cultural components. That is a historic truth which the Republic of Zaire has reflected in its policy of \\\"authenticity\\\", which President Mobutu Sese Seko has brilliantly defined as a categorical refusal to be a carbon copy of anyone.\n153.\tThe policy of apartheid is abominable because it dehumanizes individuals.\n154.\tWe reaffirm our conviction that all men an equal, that they enjoy the same rights to human dignity and respect without distinction as to color, race, religion or sex. We shall, therefore, never condone a human being or a group of human beings claiming to possess the privilege of governing other people merely because of their color.\n155.\tThat is why my country is extremely concerned for the fate of the Namibian people, which also is subjected to the abominable regime of apartheid. This is the occasion to stress that the United Nations still bears full responsibility for Namibia. I should like to remind the Assembly of the historic meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa last January, and the resolutions adopted by the Council on Namibia.\n156.\tWe know that since then our Secretary-General has traveled to South Africa and Namibia. We continue to place our trust in him to put an end as speedily as possible to this fiction that South Africa calls \\\"the task of Christian civilization\\\".\n157.\tMr. President, I should like to join my voice to those of previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations. It is an honor which all Member States of this Organization have done your country and you personally.\n158.\tMay I express the hope that under your guidance the international community will experience decisive improvements in the field of economic co-operation, in the field of the development of under-equipped countries and in the field of international policy, where we hope to see the advent of a new era of progress and mutual confidence in the interest of the whole of mankind.\n159.\tI should like Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whom I congratulate on his recent election as Secretary-Genera'!, to know that the support and understanding of the Republic of Zaire are extended to him in the performance of his lofty tasks.\n160.\tAnd now I must conclude. Economic development is one thing; the vagaries of international political life are another. But one thing is of paramount importance: a sincere will to succeed. This is, we must reject all hypocrisy in international relations so as to enable mankind and this Organization to contemplate a brighter future. Is this a forlorn hope?\n"

        "file_text": "Every year, during the general debate, we inform each other of the undertakings and hopes of our respective countries; but our overriding duty is to deal with problems that are common to all mankind, those which we must tackle together in the knowledge that, if we fail to solve them, we run the risk of frustrating the hopes and efforts of each and every one of our nations.\n75.\tI am struck by the fact that the analyses made in order to identify the key problems of mankind converge, to an increasing extent, on the same issues.\n76.\tIn the introduction to your report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l], Mr. Secretary-General, you told us that co-operation and solidarity were essential in four main areas and that we must face up to and overcome without delay four global dangers: insecurity, overpopulation, the deterioration of the environment, and the persistent poverty of the majority of the world's population. This enumeration confirms the one to which U Thant drew our attention from this same rostrum four years ago. It also coincides, in the main, with the documents published this year by the \\\"Rome Club\\\". This does got mention the political factor of fear, of insecurity but, on the other hand, it does add a further element: the danger that the non-renewable natural resources may be exhausted for lack of control over industrial development.\n77.\tEverything then indicates that we must act at three different levels. First of all, we must rid ourselves of insecurity and violence in all their manifestations; 25 years after the foundation of the United Nations, the balance of terror can no longer suffice for us. Next, we must reassert our will to base our relations on a permanent dialog. The Secretary-General referred in this regard to the \\\"balance of prudence\\\". Should we not go further still and aim at \\\"stability through co-operation\\\"?\n78.\tLast but not least, there is a new task which the international community as such must undertake, an objective which is even more difficult to attain than the others because it aims at creating a balance which we are just starting to think about: the balance of growth.\n79.\tWe cannot ignore the warning issued by U Thant four years ago. He said:\n\\\"I do not wish to seem over-dramatic, but I can only conclude from the information that is available to me as Secretary-General that the Members of the United Nations have perhaps 10 years left\\\"-six now \\\"in which to get together, forget their ancient quarrels . .. and to supply the required momentum to achieve a fairer and more balanced kind of growth. If such an agreement is not reached within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control.\\\"\nThis is the same question you asked of us today, Mr. Secretary-General.\n80.\tBelgium's answer to your threefold question is a positive one. We do want to build up a system of security on a less fragile basis than the balance of fear. We have set out resolutely on the path of co-operation and we wish to go further than the balance that is the result of mere prudence. Above all we want to help to establish the only balance capable of guaranteeing peace in the years to come: the balance of growth.\n81.\tThe first and most obvious of the threats, the threat of Armageddon, is still the continuing build-up of armaments of every kind. On this subject there are some projects, some partial achievements that foreshadow, albeit tentatively, the resolutions which we await with almost too much impatience. We do not wish to underestimate the results of a general nature which are being sought through the organization of a world disarmament conference or by reaffirming our support of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], but what seems even more important to us is concrete action in the following three areas.\n82.\tThree years ago we all stressed, as was appropriate, the probable political significance of the entry into force of a treaty prohibiting the spread of nuclear weapons.\n83.\tDuring the recent meeting in Moscow between President Nixon and Mr. Brezhnev an agreement was reached on 26 May 1972 limiting the development of intercontinental nuclear weapons. This is a first step, which we welcome as a consequence of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. It is worth remembering that the nuclear States have in fact undertaken to limit their nuclear potential. Had there been no result, moreover, the non-nuclear weapon States would have been able to ask for a review of the Treaty on the expiration of the first five-year period.\n84.\tThe members of the European Community, for their part, have actively pursued negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna with a view to reaching an agreement oil the application of safeguards. Fortunately, this agreement has been finalized; it upholds the provisions of the Treaty on non-proliferation and takes into account the particular characteristics of the European Community and Belgium, therefore, like its European partners, will shortly be asking its Parliament to ratify the agreement.\n85.\tThus, a major step forward has been taken and it is worth while highlighting it. We earnestly hope that before the end of the first five-year term further progress will have been made towards nuclear disarmament.\n86.\tThere is a second specific reason for concern. Belgium has long been convinced that it would be difficult to establish any kind of security system unless there is some rule to govern the supply of arms. This, as we are well aware, is a delicate problem which concerns both the countries that purchase weapons and those which supply them. A discussion here of this subject could lay the groundwork for an international convention establishing at least some principles which both the supplying and the purchasing countries would undertake to apply.\n87.\tThis discussion would be all the more thorough if, in the meantime, One or mOte institutes concerned with, war and peace were to concentrate their research on the preparation of such a draft international convention. The General Assembly will remember that, on our initiative, it adopted last year a iesQlution on research into peace and War [resolution 2817 (%XVI)J. It agreed that the Secretary-General should submit to it the next year his first summary report on the main Achievements of the institutes engaged in War theory research. My country hopes that, starting from 1973, this research will include one or more studies on international rules governing the supply of arms. We could then discuss them here. Right now, Belgium would be prepared to Support arty draft which would meet with the acceptance of a sufficiently large number of States that purchase arms.\n88.\tA third effort to promote disarmament is under way. Some European States, including our own, made specific proposals iii 1968 for a balanced and mutual reduction of forces in Central Europe. This initiative is particularly well justified at a time when the suggestions for organizing a conference on European security and co-operation have taken shape; for the two proposals are actually interrelated. How could oUr peoples accept us as responsible statesmen if, after a solemn European conference, at which we affirmed our will to reach an understanding, we were unable to demonstrate any real progress in the area of regional disarmament? What credibility could be placed in our endeavors if our military stockpiles continued to grow even after we had stated our intention of not using them?\n89.\tTo judge from recent talks with the USSR, a desire for progress in this area too seems to be emerging. We should make certain of this by initiating actual negotiations at the earliest opportunity.\n90.\tIt is my hope that at the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly the nations of Europe will be the bearers of good tidings, both as regards the organization of security and co-operation in Europe and as regards regional disarmament.\n91.\tBut another fear exists today, a fear generated by the spread of violence throughout the entire world, a violence whose motivations are sometimes political and sometimes ideological, social or racial, where they are not simply based on greed. These crimes are always odious, and the fear they generate is justified, for the victims of the hijackings, kidnappings, the taking of hostages, wanton destruction with plastic bombs and firing on crowds are more often than not innocent people thrust into the forefront like shields. These crimes are proliferating in every corner of the globe, even the furthest removed from the areas of conflict; they are not the dubious privilege of any particular region, and the whole world is thus faced with a unique kind of problem. The Secretary-General was therefore right to raise it.\n92.\tAnd the unique problem, as we see it is, what protective or punitive action can our Organization suggest or take? What rules can be proposed for all States to apply when faced with such crimes? And if these rules were adopted, what should be the collective behavior of our States, were these rules to be violated? Secretary of State Rogers has made some specific proposals on this [2038th meeting].\n93.\tBelgium hopes that this unfortunately universal problem which has been referred to our Legal Committee will be taken up without reference to any particular manifestation of this evil, but in an effort to determine what joint collective attitudes might have been useful at each critical moment in the recent past, and those which might prevent their recurrence wherever it may be. For the work of our Legal Committee to be fruitful, we believe that it should be informed by three common ideas.\n94.\tFirst, there is no question that we all bear responsibility for seeking to eliminate the known causes of often desperate acts. Repression cannot save a society whose citizens are convinced that revolt is their only recourse.\n95.\tBut, second, we must recognize that no injustice suffered will ever justify the injustice of acts of terrorism. Since, according to the philosophy of the United Nations, war should always give way to negotiation or arbitration as our Charter states it follows that whenever wanton violence is fostered by individuals or groups of individuals, that, too, must be condemned by the canons of the same international order.\n96.\tWanton violence can never justify equally wanton revenge. When international public order is disrupted, an escalation of violence is just as reprehensible.\n97.\tMy country also shares the concern of the Secretary- General regarding another form of violence, that which has arisen several times in recent years in Asia, Africa and Europe, involving the death of many innocent civilians. I am referring to the most serious forms of internal warfare. Belgium has been deeply shocked in the last few years, and again quite recently, by several such cases. None of our countries by itself can, without creating serious public confrontation, go further, in making its representations to a State that is torn internally, than to express the anxiety or condemnation of its own public opinion. But we realize that the victims in those countries do not understand our official semi-silence. Of course the organizations of the United Nations family and also the new agency for co-ordinating efforts in the event of disaster do come to the aid of the survivors; that is fine, but we do not believe it is enough. The voice of the world's conscience the only one powerful enough to halt the slaughter ought to be able to make itself heard on these occasions. Will the United Nations be able, and does it indeed have the will, to lay down principles of action,- to limit by mutual consent the exclusive sovereignty of our States? Can we reconcile respect for the sacredness of human life with Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter?\n98.\tWe would like to address an appeal to the international non-governmental organizations which are seeking to ensure respect for human rights. Could they not devote their efforts to this serious problem which is so important for human dignity and make specific suggestions on action they advocate? Belgium pledges itself to do everything in its power to ensure that these proposals, based on the opinions of men of goodwill throughout the world, will be taken up at the next session of the General Assembly.\n99.\tThis appeal addressed to the international non-governmental organizations, gives me an opportunity in passing to underline their growing importance. Today The Union of International Associations numbers more than 2,500 such organizations as compared with 560 in 1965. It is a sound idea, therefore, to consider in the spirit of the Charter the increasingly effective participation of the non-governmental organizations in international action.\n100.\tIt was you, Mr. Secretary-General, who coined the expression \\\"balance of prudence\\\" to denote a certain degree of progress, namely the fact that groups, nations and States, hitherto hostile, were manifestly striving towards dialog, understanding and negotiation and, indeed, sometimes reconciliation. You quote some recent cases which are in all our minds: the German States, North Korea and South Korea, India and Pakistan. Mr. Rogers, for his part, has mentioned all the other efforts at rapprochement which are being made.\n101.\tWe cannot just sit back and congratulate ourselves on this. What part can the international community play, either on a world-wide basis or at the regional level, to create a state of stability through co-operation? This is a vast subject and I shall confine myself to some ideas about two lines of action.\n102.\tAs regards peace, our ^Organization bears special responsibilities in the Middle East. We must ask ourselves if it is accomplishing all that is expected of it. The cease-fire is still in force, but it has not been possible to halt the destructive sequence of acts of violence and reprisals. The Soviet disengagement from Egypt has reduced the danger of a polarization of the conflict between the super-Powers, but after five years the peoples that confront each other are still somewhere in between war and peace.\n103.\tFor us the basis of a negotiated solution remains Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which the great Powers and the principal States concerned supported. I know it is five years old, but it is not obsolete; it contains the principles of an agreement. It would be otiose, in our view, to interpret it or to try to improve on it. Its practical implementation is principally the responsibility of the parties, aided by those designated by the United Nations to assist them. In this connexion I wish to pay a tribute to the efforts we have witnessed, particularly those of U Thant and Mr. Jarring and those which you, Mr. Secretary- General, have made.\n104.\tAnother definite prospect was President El-Sadat's proposal of 4 February 1971 and the interest likewise shown by Israel in seeking an interim solution which would include the reopening of the Suez Canal. If this agreement is acted upon it will prove that mutually beneficial arrangements can be reached between States which are still somewhere between war and peace. Other partial approaches can be imagined. The important thing in our view is that a constructive move should be made to end a dangerous state of immobility. It would then be possible to tackle, with higher hopes, other problems connected with an over-all solution. And a particular place must be reserved here for the problem of the Palestinian people.\n105.\tWe would like to think that, at the outset of the search for an interim solution, it would be possible to identify the principles common to all the parties which are already explicitly set forth in resolution 242 (1967). We, for our part, have always attached particular importance to the twofold preliminary declaration which stresses both \\\"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\\\" and \\\"the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security\\\".\n106.\tIs this not an established fact? If so, it would be easier to agree that the declared positions of each of the parties on matters under dispute are not ultimatums but only negotiating terms.\n107.\tPeace will never come without the agreement of all the parties, but it is for our Organization to help them in this as effectively as possible. I should like to say in conclusion on this problem that if the European Community can make some contribution to peace-making -Belgium would repeat what it has often stated here: its assistance in the economic and social rehabilitation of the peoples which have suffered most from the war would be, and I hope will be, the most effective contribution of the European Economic Community.\n108.\tI have just described the mission of Europe in the world-wide movement for closer ties. My country openly rejoices at the fact that Europe, as a continent, is moving ahead resolutely towards co-operation, stability and detente. The continuing development and enlargement of the European communities are a solid guarantee of this; the active preparation of the conference on European security is another. Let me to tell you something about these two events which are such important milestones on the road, towards that future world harmony which in our opinion will find its most reliable basis in regional structures and stages.\n109.\tAs regards the process of building Western Europe, no one can remain indifferent to the fact that neighboring countries, governed by the same principles of parliamentary democracy, are joining together in a common destiny-after having, for the last few centuries, shaken the world with their confrontations. The only reason for concern to which this progressive union might give rise would be that this Europe, in becoming a leading commercial and economic Power, might not assume all the world responsibilities flowing from its new status.\n110.\tFrom this very rostrum Sir Alec Douglas-Home vigorously rejected this idea in his statement at the 2042nd meeting. He expressed our common conviction. I shall shortly refer to all that this enlarged Community should contribute in order to promote a genuine balance of growth.\n111.\tBut, however proud we may feel at having built a new community, we are well aware that it does not represent all of Europe. The States of our continent have chosen different paths: some have chosen a common destiny within the Community; others prefer neutrality or non-involvement, which debars them from any delegation of sovereignty; the last group is governed by a system of State economy. But among these three groups, or in these States as a whole, there has been a proliferation of bilateral agreements over the past few years, and now the prospect of the forthcoming conference on European security paves the way for a multilateral meeting such as has not occurred since 1815 at which the problems of common interest will be discussed simultaneously by all the States concerned.\n112.\tThe time has not yet come to lay the basis for a permanent understanding among the countries of our continent. The fundamental values on which our systems are based are too different and the goals we pursue are too dissimilar.\n113.\tBut if we succeed in this first attempt we will have initiated a process. We know it will be long and difficult, but it could lead to a permanent understanding on a continental scale. We would then have proved that it is only through co-operation that the conditions for genuine stability and peace can be created something which no one would dream of challenging.\n114.\tI come now to my third subject. Up to now I have spoken about the strictly political aspects of relations between States, but we are aware that they are no longer the only ones to claim priority as matters of international concern. We are faced with a whole new dimension in world problems. We see the suddenly increasing complexity of a problem which both affects and involves all living beings, because we have to answer a global question: can we, and for how long preserve a physically and socially inhabitable earth? Each human being, each thinking man on our planet, whether he lives in an affluent or a needy society, is asking himself that question. It is then that basic questions are asked. How far can human reproduction go? Must we save non-renewable mineral resources? How can we prevent the destruction of the natural environment? Is food production limitless? Is the interminable material growth of certain types of production in the developed societies conceivable in itself, and this in the face of the continuing stagnation or retrogression of the underdeveloped societies?\n115.\tAll these are questions which no State can any longer solve on its own and for itself. But all these are questions to which our specialized agencies, each in the field of competence indicated by its title, can supply partial answers. And here, there is some reason for gratification that this year of 1972 has witnessed the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago, Chile, and the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. An important world conference on population is to be held in 1974. But we are aware that all the partial or sectoral answers provided by specialized world conferences or agencies must hence forth be co-ordinated. Where will the co-ordinating be done? How can we organize for the whole world a new balance of growth in which the ecological, economic and social plans would of necessity be interdependent?\n116.\tAt present there is only one organization in the world which can ask that question with authority and recommend the gradual formulation of a policy in which each component will have to be linked with several others. That is our own Organization.\n117.\tWe would like to make a suggestion: that we begin with the preparation of a joint declaration on the aims of and means for a new balance of growth. If you believe that this is a necessary and an urgent task, to whom should it be assigned?\n118.\tOn 3 October [2050th meeting] my colleague and friend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Mr. Schmelzer, raised a very similar question, even though we had not consulted together beforehand. He told us that the Economic and Social Council was the central forum for formulating a co-ordinated policy. We are well aware that that prospect has been followed very closely by the Latin American countries. Mr. de Seynes, in his report to the Second Committee at its 1449th meeting, made another proposal and suggested UNITAR. We would draw the attention of the Assembly to this matter, and we know that the Secretary-General will take it up.\n119.\tThe balanced growth of mankind in each of its components is a problem on which we can see a collective awareness is emerging. It is in any event the duty of the United Nations to tackle it.\n120.\tThe global question I have just raised totally transcends the question of underdevelopment, but in putting it in this way it is not our intention to play down or in any way to set aside the responsibility of the developed countries towards the developing countries. On the contrary, I wish to express the hope that the enlarged European Community for its part will, at its forthcoming solemn session in Paris, provide the beginning of a reply to this problem when it outlines its foreign policy for the coming decade in its relations with the southern hemisphere.\n121.\tIn this area, it seems to me, everything points to Europe as the area for taking the first step.\n122.\tNow, through its enlargement it has become the world's leading trading power and in many respects the world's leading economic power.\n123.\tNow, after having closed the colonial chapter in the world's history book, it has found in the equality of States and the mutual respect of independent States, and also in long-established mutual understanding, a kind of privileged relationship with most countries.\n124.\tNow, by dint of its very situation between the super-Powers, its friendship with North America, by the detente in the east, it has no designs for remote political control and its defense responsibilities are limited to its own area in other words, its military establishment and budget are both of moderate size.\n125.\tFinally, for a quarter of a century now, it has been accustomed to seeking the progressive redistribution of the benefits of its growth to promote the social welfare of its own citizens. All it has to do now, therefore, is to get used to extending the same solidarity to the third world.\n126.\tAt this point in its history, such a Europe seems to me to be well placed to make the first offers to other regions of the world, without at the same time overlooking its duties to the developing countries.\n127.\tLet us therefore help to ensure that the tariff negotiations of 1973 will provide the developing countries with the maximum advantages; that the new monetary structures will forge new links between the wealthiest countries and the others. In this connexion the decisions taken last month by the International Monetary Fund are on the right lines. Let us also provide greater access to a common market for the manufactured goods produced by the Group of 77 developing countries. Let us contribute, on a case-by-case basis, to the stabilization of commodity prices and, finally, establish the order of magnitude-which will increase over the next 10 years of how much can be voluntarily siphoned off from European prosperity towards development. Belgium, for its part, is in favor of all these steps.\n128.\tI have just described what we hope the countries of the European Community can do to break away from the balance of fear, to rise above the balance of prudence and to achieve the balance of growth. But all of Europe, in the process of rapprochement, will make its contribution, too.\n129.\tMr. President, you are a European, a citizen of the great nation of Poland in which the civilization of our continent flourishes. Belgium welcomes your leadership of this Assembly. I remember that the renowned Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Rapacki, was in 1966 one of the first to speak to us about a conference on European security and the balanced reduction of forces. Indeed, one of the drafts bore his name.\n130.\tIt will be understood why, in mentioning and saluting your presidency, Sir, I should call to mind and associate with our tribute to the President of the General Assembly the memory of another great European: a statesman who, 27 years ago, presided over the first General Assembly of the United Nations, Paul-Henri Spaak who passed away a few weeks ago. How can we forget a voice and a mind of such resonance, devoted to the noble cause of peace and European reconstruction. That is why I wish to evoke his memory today.\n131.\tMr. Secretary-General, knowing you as the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations, as belonging to one of the most noble peoples of old Europe, and as a Minister for Foreign Affairs whom we have seen at work, we have been able to appreciate your devotion to the cause of a more united Europe, transcending ideological differences and respecting the identity of each of its States. Belgium conveys to you, through me, its congratulations and the assurance of its full co-operation. By today responding, in essence, to the questions posed in the introduction to your report [A/8701/Add.l] we have sought to demonstrate the importance we attach to your initiative.\n132.\tAnd so my concluding words are a promise: Mr. Secretary-General, you can count on the support of Belgium.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Ghana delegation and on my own behalf I congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office is an honor not only to yourself but also to your country, Poland, with which Ghana has had such friendly and useful ties for many years. Colonel Acheampong, Head of State and Chairman of the National Redemption Council, has expressly asked me to convey to you fraternal greetings of the Government and people of Ghana. He also wishes me to assure you of the support of the Government of Ghana for your efforts as President of this session of the Assembly. I am mandated to assure you, Mr. President, that the Government of Ghana will continue to support and to play its role in the affairs of this Assembly, despite its preoccupation with its difficult economic and social problems.\n166.\tThe economic development of Ghana, like that of other developing countries, is plagued by an inequitable system of international trade and by a world financial structure which seems to maintain an iniquitous status quo- the poor shall become poorer and the already prosperous, richer. It is in the face of this grim reality that we in Ghana are striving not only to survive but to create for ourselves a decent standard of living. Time was when we thought foreign aid was the answer to our economic difficulties. Experience has now taught us that the present terms under which foreign aid is given generates not prosperity and plenty, but misery and privation. We have learned that the answer to our economic difficulties is not to continue to parade the corridors of the big Powers with cap in hand, begging for alms to feed our people and to develop our country. Our economic salvation lies in our own hands, and our success can be measured only by the effort we ourselves are prepared to make. That is why, since assuming the administration of Ghana barely nine months ago, the National Redemption Council, under the inspiring leadership of Colonel Acheampong, has insisted on a total mobilization of the entire resources of the country.\n167.\tBut are the difficulties and sacrifices which a \\\"go-it-alone\\\" policy implies necessary in our world today? Are all the professions of international solidarity mere empty phrases? It is the view of my delegation that the United Nations has since its inception been too preoccupied with the containment of political problems, important though these are. The larger issue, in the view of my delegation, the far more dangerous tension arising from indefensible disparities in economic levels of well-being, has not received the attention it deserves, especially from the big Powers of the world which, given the will, have the capacity to create a world without hunger, a world without poverty, a world without disease.\n168.\tAs far back as 1944, at Dumbarton Oaks, the founding fathers of the United Nations recognized the dangers inherent in economic and social disparities, and accordingly entrenched in the Charter the need for their eventual elimination. The Charter envisages the employment of international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.\n169.\tThe United Nations has already celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. But in spite of the launching of the two development decades, the gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to grow. Indeed, international trade and national fiscal systems and institutions make such a trend inevitable. It is true that some developed countries have taken some steps to meet the targets of the Second United Nations Development Decade. A scheme of generalized preferences in favor of the imports of developing countries has been put into effect by some advanced countries. Temporary measures have also been adopted to stabilize and restructure the international monetary system. But on the basis of the evidence, it is hard to escape the conclusion that for many developed countries the solemn endorsements given to the strategies and programs of action of the two development decades were only words of exhortation, and that we in the developing world were too naive in taking public pronouncements of the rich and powerful seriously.\n170.\tThe shortcomings of the International Development Strategy are in a large measure due to a lack of generous, over-all response in terms of official development assistance to be provided by the advanced countries. An alarming decline in public and legislative support in certain significant donor countries is progressively hardening into national policy. Unwillingness to liberalize tariffs, restrictive commercial and trade practices, and failure to agree on stable commodity prices have all adversely affected the prospects for improving the terms of trade of developing countries.\n171.\tIn contrast to the attractive prices of the products of advanced countries which are progressively going through an upward adjustment, primary products, which sustain the economies of developing countries, are constantly suffering a catastrophic plunge. It should be obvious to the international community that, given the fluctuations in the prices of primary products, the prospect of the developing world earning enough to meet its foreign exchange and investment needs is very, very slim. Yet since the advanced countries continue to be dependent on primary products to feed their growing industries, it is to the mutual advantage of both parties to come to an early agreement on a system of stabilization of commodity prices on the implicit understanding that such an encouraging booster to the production of primary products will, by the same token, assure the continued success of the dependent industries in the advanced countries.\n172.\tThat is why it is a matter of considerable regret to my Government that no international cocoa agreement has yet been concluded. Cocoa provides nearly 80 per cent of Ghana's foreign-exchange earnings, and it is therefore the fervent hope of the Ghana Government that, at the United Nations Cocoa Conference currently meeting in Geneva, positive conclusions can be reached in respect of cocoa.\n173.\tNor has this lack of significant economic progress been much helped by the monetary and financial crises and the floating of currencies by developed countries. If anything, these have largely served to accentuate the problems of developing countries. What has so greatly affected the capacity of developing countries to accomplish the planned targets of the International Development Strategy is the growing debt burden. If Ghana's experience is any guide, the debt disability imposed on developing countries is not the sole consequence of the depletion of foreign exchange earned through their export trade. In Ghana's particular case, for instance, a number of the projects, financed by suppliers' credits, were not preceded by the usual feasibility studies, which would have assured their profitability. Commissions of inquiry and other investigations conducted in Ghana have clearly established that some of the contracts were tainted with corruption. Undue inflation in respect of the prices quoted has also come to light. Added to this were the harsh repayment terms which closed the door to reasonable resources being generated to allow amortization of the debts. No wonder that many projects have turned out to be white elephants, deficient in productive results. In the light of this, the Government of Ghana expects other countries to view with understanding and sympathy the action taken by the Ghana Government in respect of its debts.\n174.\tThese disappointments brought about in our development by a host of factors, not the least of which was the sharp business practices of some creditor countries, have only increased Ghana's resolve to be self-reliant. In adopting this policy of self-reliance, we do not imply that the door is shut for genuine foreign aid from friendly countries. Our aim is to enhance the living standards of Ghanaians and to lay the foundation of institutions which will cultivate the cultural and spiritual values of the individual in an atmosphere of peace and justice. For foreign aid to be accepted, it would have to come on the most generous terms satisfying the liberal repayment arrangements of the\nInternational Development Agency. Ghana is also persuaded of the advantages that would accrue from diversification of its trade links with new and growing markets. In consideration of this potential benefit, plans are under way to reactivate trade and payment arrangements with Ghana's non-traditional trading partners.\n175.\tNotwithstanding the noble objectives of the International Development Strategy, there is a growing credibility gap between intentions and performance. Technology is accentuating the inequalities between the advanced and the developing countries. While the nations of the northern hemisphere live in affluence and unprecedented comfort, the greater number of countries are condemned to a life of abject poverty, afflicted by innumerable diseases and lacking adequate social services to make life worth living. And yet the developing countries have contributed a great deal and continue to contribute significantly to the economic well-being of the affluent. Do we have to live with this situation or is it our bounden duty as an international community to remedy it through our joint efforts?\n176.\tIt was this same concern which prompted the President of the World Bank to remark recently that the rich nations of the world possessing 25 per cent of its people but 80 per cent of its wealth should have to provide the additional assistance in the form of aid and trade which the developing nations need to meet minimum national goals. That additional assistance can be financed by diverting but a tiny percentage of the incremental income which will accrue to the developed countries during the 1970s.\n177.\tScientific and technological advances have made the world a global village and increased the interdependence of nation-States. The problems of a section of our closely-knit world can only be ignored by the rest at its peril. We are reminded that the astronauts who went into outer space dramatically realized the world's smallness and oneness on looking back. As Woodrow Wilson warned, \\\"You cannot have peace, you cannot even have your legitimate part in the business of the world, unless you are partners with the rest.\\\"\n178.\tWe believe that the philosophy of interdependence should be reflected in an appropriate and sound foreign policy which would provide the framework for the real progress of man. This brings me to the foreign policy of Ghana. In this respect I can do no more than to quote the words of our Head of State, Colonel Acheampong, on 17 January this year. He said:\n\\\"Our foreign policy will first of all be based on a vigorous and dynamic African policy. We intend to foster the closest and most cordial relations with all African brothers who are still not free and who suffer deprivations, degradation and indignity on the continent of their birth. Accordingly, we shall vigorously support the eradication of the last remnants of colonialism and racial discrimination from the African continent. Our fellow Africans, struggling for control of their own destiny under the racists of South Africa, under the rebel regime of Ian Smith, in Namibia and in Portuguese-held parts of Africa will have our unflinching support.\\\"\n179.\tOn the OAU, Colonel Acheampong stated:\n\\\"We subscribe unreservedly to the charter of the OAU, and it is our resolve to lend effective support to all efforts aimed at making it an effective body for the expression and the realization of African aspirations.\\\"\n180.\tOn non-alignment, Colonel Acheampong said:\n\\\"Ghana's traditional policy since we became independent has been one of non-alignment.... The Government of Ghana would pursue a truly non-aligned policy; we shall be friends with all who would like to be friends with us; Ghana will not interfere in the internal affairs of any sovereign State and we expect all States to observe the same principle in their dealings with us.\\\"\n181.\tOn the United Nations, Colonel Acheampong stated:\n\\\"The new Government of Ghana reaffirms its support for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and we intend to play our full part in the United Nations and in its various organs for the achievement of the aims and purposes of the United Nations Organization\\\".\n182.\tIt is in the light of our declared foreign policy that I shall proceed to make a few observations on the world political situation.\n183.\tThe world political picture, as we see it from Ghana, is far from satisfactory. Strife and conflicts continue to disturb the peace of the world: the guns of war are still booming, bombs are still falling on helpless persons in many parts of the world; and the legitimate rights of sections of the world population are still being trodden upon by men who nevertheless profess high moral principles.\n184.\tI turn now to Viet-Nam. If Indochina still continues to hit the world headlines it is because the tragic war in Viet-Nam is still with us. The cost in terms of economic and ecological waste, not counting the toll in human lives and suffering, is a blot on this Organization, which has found itself powerless to bring an end to this human tragedy. There can be no doubt now that force cannot settle the Vietnamese problem, as the massive bombing of North Viet-Nam has amply shown. The answer lies in negotiations. The understanding which is emerging between the two Germany, and between North and South Korea, assures us that this is possible. In our view the complete withdrawal of foreign forces already initiated should allow the Vietnamese people freely to settle their differences. We therefore call for a halt to the bombing of the North, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Viet-Nam, and the recognition of the principle of self-determination in Viet-Nam.\n185.\tI turn now to the Middle East. Under the relative calm in the Middle East lies a potentially explosive situation in regard to which we have a joint responsibility to forestall a fresh outbreak of hostilities in an area which has known so much human suffering. In the considered view of the Ghana delegation, the key to an enduring peace in the Middle East involves the surrender of territories acquired as prizes of war in return for the recognition of the rights of all States in the area and the finding of a just solution to the Palestinian problem. The conditions embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contain the balanced objectives to which my delegation wholeheartedly subscribes.\n186.\tWith regard to southern Africa, as I have already indicated earlier in my statement, the National Redemption Council has declared as a cardinal principle of Ghana's foreign policy the total emancipation of Africa from foreign domination. The Ghana Government is concerned about the continuing existence of colonialism, neocolonialism and racial discrimination not only in Africa but also in various parts of the world. These phenomena constitute a glaring anachronism while at the same time posing a potential danger to world peace.\n187.\tOf particular concern to my Government is the increasingly grave situation in southern Africa, whose problems pose a challenge to the aims and purposes of the United Nations. As I speak now, Portugal is waging a senseless war in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea (Bissau) to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the indigenous populations and to prevent them from enjoying a decent existence in the land of their birth. Again, as I speak now, rebel Ian Smith is riding high on his illegal usurpation of power, and continues to exploit the African majority for the benefit of the white minority. As I speak now, Vorster's apartheid system is further consolidating itself and extending its grip to Namibia. These hardened colonialists and racists, with the connivance and support of their friends, have defied civilized world opinion and have flouted with impunity all decent human values. How long can we remain indifferent to the persistence of these ills, which not only negate all that the United Nations stands for but also constitute a veritable threat to world peace? My delegation strongly believes-and would issue a warning that if the deplorable and disgraceful situation in southern Africa does not change by peaceful means it will be changed by violence, the repercussions of which will go far beyond the borders of southern Africa.\n188.\tIt is no secret that the situation in southern Africa has persisted for so long because of the aid and comfort which certain countries, particularly in the West, have been giving to these colonialist and racist regimes. The sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the Smith regime are constantly being breached by all sorts of devious means, and in this connexion it is a matter of deep regret that some major Powers are great offenders. Portugal, poor and under-developed as it is, could not have continued with this senseless war in Africa but for the material and diplomatic support of its NATO allies. Vorster's South Africa continues to enjoy the support and massive investment of international capitalist organizations, and so grows fat on the slave labor of Africans. It has even been emboldened to attempt to extend its obnoxious policies into Namibia, which is a United Nations Trust Territory. The Government of Ghana condemns without reserve all those countries which, for selfish financial gains, lend support to these regimes. The Government of Ghana adheres to the OAU declaration rejecting dialog as a means of bringing about a change in the apartheid policies of the racist Republic of South Africa. We have taken this position because we do not believe that the conditions for such a dialog exist.\n189.\tSince it is quite obvious that the forces of colonialism and apartheid have defied all persuasive arguments for change, is it any wonder that the African nationalists have been compelled to take up arms against these regimes?\n190.\tThe Government of Ghana will continue to support, both morally and materially, the liberation movements in Africa, and to work within the framework of the OAU for the realization of their aims. In line with our declared, support for those liberation movements, the Ghana Government has offered to host the next meeting of the OAU Committee of Liberation, scheduled for January 1973, and preparations for it are already well under way.\n191.\tI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the appeal launched by my Government's delegation at the August 1972 Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non- Aligned Countries in Guyana for material support for the liberation movements in Africa, That appeal is now directed to all peace-loving States represented here at the United Nations which have at heart the welfare of all mankind, including the peoples of Africa. The liberation movements in Africa enjoy the official recognition of the OAU and continue to receive material assistance from it. In other words, there already exists the machinery within the OAU through which such material assistance can be channeled, and I would propose that for a start we all use that machinery.\n192.\tFurthermore, my delegation strongly supports the proposed United Nations special fund to aid the liberation movements in Africa. Those liberation movements need all the assistance they can obtain from all peace-loving peoples, and we should contribute generously to aiding them. The liberation movements in Africa are fighting for their freedom, and victory will surely be theirs. We can all hasten that victory by contributing generously towards the success of their efforts. The time for fine words of sympathy and concern is over. This is the time for action.\n193.\tIt is a sad fact that the world's arms race is ever sky-rocketing, having now reached a record of expenditure of some $200,000 million, an all time high, of which the two super-Powers alone are responsible for over 70 per cent. In spite of the parity in nuclear second-strike force reached between the two super-Powers, which would discount, if not eliminate, any nuclear knock-out victory through a surprise attack, the dangerous and vicious circle of arms build-up continues.\n194.\tIt is admitted that in the absence of a reliable system of international security, national security will continue to assume a high priority in the consideration of all Governments. Even so, there is hardly any justification for allowing the arms race to reach such alarming proportions. The Ghana Government joins the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, in calling for a comprehensive moratorium on all nuclear testing, underground as well as in the atmosphere, as a necessary step towards general and complete disarmament [see A/8701/Add.l, p. 3J. In this regard my Government welcomes the progress made at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and hopes that the modest beginning made in reaching limited agreement will lead to further progress in all fields of disarmament. Savings made in the area of disarmament could not only be usefully employed in meeting the social and economic demands at home but could also be applied in ridding the world of much of its squalor, poverty and disease.\n195.\tIt is the view of my delegation that disarmament cannot be left at the mercy of the super-Powers and the big Powers. The Government of Ghana therefore looks forward to the proposed world disarmament conference. Disarmament is an issue of universal concern. The Government of Ghana is convinced that this very desirable conference should be open to all States. My Government would be happy to participate in such a conference and to contribute to its success.\n196.\tI have tried to outline, as briefly as possible, the world political situation as we see it from Ghana. As I have already stated, the situation is far from satisfactory.\n197.\tWe acknowledge, however, that over the past year there has been some significant improvement in certain areas of international relations, which gives us hope for a brighter future. I would cite particularly President Nixon's visits to Peking and Moscow, and the various moves for rapprochement between the two Germany, and between Eastern and Western Europe generally. The efforts of North Korea and South Korea to normalize their relations are welcome moves in the right direction, and the Simla Agreement reached between India and Pakistan is a commendable step on the road to peace between the two countries. My delegation also notes with gratification the current talks, between the Prime Ministers of China and Japan. The Government of Ghana welcomes all those encouraging trends in the world political situation, and lends them its full support.\n198.\tAided by advances in science and technology, man has conquered distance, found a cure for many diseases and, on the whole, improved living standards to an extent undreamed of by his forefathers. The frantic search for an affluent society and the uninhibited use of technology have naturally had their adverse consequences. The imbalance between population, industry and natural resources is already posing a threat to human existence on this planet; the depletion of natural resources, pollution and other forms of nuisance are threatening the very foundation of human life itself.\n199.\tEnvironmental neglect, with its threatening disaster, is not the exclusive concern of the more industrialized countries. It is as much a problem of the developing as of the advanced countries. Soil erosion and exhaustion, whether brought about by shifting cultivation or by deforestation; the pollution of rivers and seas caused by dumping of waste and filth; the increasing pollution of the air; insufficient sanitary facilities; unchecked soil erosion; overcrowding of the cities these and a host of other environmental issues are all matters of universal concern.\n200.\tGhana participated^ the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972. Together with other concerned nations we worked out a strategy to prevent the further deterioration of our natural heritage.\u2003\n201. As a developing country, Ghana has its share of polluted rivers and the threat they pose both to aquatic life and to the millions of people in the villages who depend on those rivers as their source of drinking water. That was why Ghana called for a fund to provide potable water. We reiterate that call here. As my delegation emphasized at the Stockholm Conference, we shall continue to use technology and industrialization to improve the quality of human life without necessarily sacrificing the need for environmental protection. Industrialization and preservation of the environment need not be mutually exclusive, for it is the belief of my delegation that determined research into the technology of industrialization could minimize, if not eliminate entirely, the pollution which is at present incidental to industrialization.\n202. The Stockholm Conference appropriately had as its motto \\\"Only One Earth\\\". Our destinies are linked together. Our problems cannot be solved in isolation. Peace and prosperity are indivisible. Our protestations for peace in Viet-Nam and other parts of the world and our preoccupation with the well-being of their people will ring hollow unless they are accompanied by sincere concern for the oppressed people everywhere, including the oppressed black peoples of southern Africa and all people of African descent. Finally, the Government of Ghana reaffirms its determination to work in concert with freedom-loving people everywhere to build a world of peace, justice and freedom for all.\n"

        "file_text": "Comrade Trepczyriski, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR sincerely congratulates you, the representative of Poland, a fraternal country in the socialist community of States, on your unanimous election to the office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and wishes you success in this responsible task.\n42.\tWe welcome the new Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and the efforts he is directing towards the maintenance and strengthening of peace and international security, which is the principal task of the United Nations.\n43.\tIn characterizing the contemporary international scene and ways of strengthening international security, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR would first like to draw attention to a momentous event which took place 50 years ago, since it has a direct bearing on the development of relations among States and nations and on today's international situation. What I have in mind is the fact that this year the peoples of the Soviet Union and all progressive mankind will be celebrating the fifty-fifth anniversary of\nSoviet rule and the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The triumph of the great October socialist revolution brought about the close unification of all popular forces in our country, headed by the working class, with the aim of abolishing the system of capitalist exploitation, and with it the system of national oppression. The complete victory of the ideas of socialist revolution and Leninist national policy has forged all the nations and peoples of our great motherland into a single international brotherhood and has directed their efforts towards the establishment of a new society, based on the unity of the class interests of all workers in the name of that noblest of causes, the building of communism.\n44.\tThe voluntary joining of 15 republics in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a clear expression of their socialist sovereignty and provides firm guarantees for that sovereignty. Indeed, the First All-Byelorussian Congress of Soviets states in its Declaration of 2 February 1919 that negotiations should be started with the Russian Soviet Republic towards the establishment of federal links between it and Soviet Byelorussia and addressed to all fraternal independent socialist republics the proposal that they should follow the example of the workers and peasants of Byelorussia and should engage in negotiations towards the establishment of federal links with Soviet Russia and among themselves.\n45.\tThe establishment of the USSR and co-operation and mutual aid between over a hundred nations and peoples within a single multinational State, with constant regard for both the interests of our Union as a whole and the interests of each of its component republics, has created favorable conditions for the restructuring of society on socialist foundations, for advancing the economies and cultures of all the Soviet republics and for strengthening the defensive might and the international positions of the multinational workers' State. This may be seen from the example of the Byelorussian SSR.\n46.\tIn pre-revolutionary Byelorussia, the per capita industrial output was nearly five times lower than in Russia as a whole. Today, the output of the industry of the Byelorussian SSR in three days in equivalent to a year's output 50 years ago. The Republic uses in one day an amount of electric power which it would have taken over 17 years to produce in pre-revolutionary times.\n47.\tIn agriculture, we have passed from the wooden plough and primitive soil-tilling to highly developed collective and State farm production using modern techniques and have turned agricultural labor into a form of industrial output.\n48.\tIn education and culture, we have passed from the eradication of illiteracy (before the revolution 8 out of 10 inhabitants of Byelorussia could neither read nor write) to a situation where three out of every five members of the working population have completed secondary or higher education. Moreover, every third inhabitant of the Republic is undergoing some kind of education. On the eve of the First World War, only three books were published in Byelorussia for every 100 inhabitants, while this figure now stands at three books for each individual.\n49.\tDuring the years of Soviet rule, the life span of the population has more than doubled, and now stands at 72 years.\n50.\tHuman well-being is the supreme goal of social production under socialism. Production is constantly growing, and the level of living of the population is rising commensurately. Over the eighth five-year plan period alone (1966-1970), the real income of the population increased by 40 per cent, while payments and grants from the social consumption funds, ensuring free education at all levels, free medical services for the population, the upkeep of children's institutions and the payment of pensions, students' scholarships, social insurance benefits and other public services and payments, increased by 60 per cent. Housing construction is increasing at a rapid rate: during the last five-year plan period, every fifth inhabitant of the Republic celebrated a housewarming.\n51.\tThese advances have been achieved in spite of the fact that during the lifetime of a single generation we have twice been obliged to begin our development practically from scratch. One need only recall the destruction in the wake of the First World War and the civil war and the fact that in December 1944, six months after the liberation of the territory of the Byelorussian SSR from the German Fascist invaders, the industrial output of the Republic was only 10 per cent of the pre-war level, and that immediately after the liberation some 3 million of the population or nearly every other person-were homeless. One out of four inhabitants of the Republic perished in the heroic struggle against the dark forces of fascism.\n52.\tThe peoples of most of the countries represented in the United Nations fortunately did not have to undergo similar sufferings and destruction. We know what war means and are endeavoring to ensure that no people should experience the horrors of war and foreign invasion.\n53.\tBy its every step and its every act in the international arena, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics confirms that it has been, is and always will be a mighty bastion and the most tireless defender of the peace and freedom of the peoples and of their friendship and co-operation. The first socialist State, created under the leadership of V. I. Lenin, stated in its declaration to all the working Moslems of Russia and the East that the working people of Russia burned with the one desire of attaining a just peace and helping the oppressed peoples of the world to win their freedom.\n54.\tFrom the earliest days of its existence, the Soviet State has blazed the trail for completely new principles in relations among nations and peoples. Peace and freedom for the peoples; friendship, equality and fraternity between all races and nationalities; peaceful coexistence of States with different social structures; fraternal co-operation and mutual assistance-these are the basic principles which were proclaimed by the Soviet land and which the Soviet Union and the peoples of all its 15 Union Republics have consistently implemented and are implementing today.\n55.\tToday we see that these principles are gaining increasingly wide recognition, that they represent a decisive factor in contemporary international relations, that they\nserve as a basis for the concerted policy of the countries of the socialist community and that they have become a banner for all progressive forces. Significant and encouraging changes in relations between States with different social structures are taking place before our eyes.\n56.\tThe events currently taking place on the international scene again confirm the profound vitality and effectiveness of the active peace-loving foreign policy of the socialist countries and the great international significance of the program for peace advanced by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which sets out a series of measures for the settlement of international problems affecting the future of all mankind.\n57.\tAlthough a relatively short period of time has elapsed since the Twenty-fourth Congress, it is already possible to state quite definitely that it would be hard to find in the past another short period marked by so many important foreign policy initiatives, actions and fruitful negotiations.\n58.\tOne of the principal results of the endeavor of the Soviet Union and the other fraternal socialist countries in the sphere of foreign policy has been the strengthening in international relations of the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social structures. The changes that are taking place in this area are positively astounding. After all, only quite recently, as many representatives will remember, there were people who were afraid even to utter the words \\\"peaceful coexistence\\\" and did everything they could to obstruct the inclusion of such concepts in the resolutions adopted in the United Nations and other international organizations. But now the principle of peaceful coexistence is proclaimed in the most important international political and legal documents governing relations between States with different social structures.\n59.\tThe principles of co-operation between the Soviet Union and France, treaties between the USSR and a number of other countries, the signing on 29 May 1972 of the basic principles of relations between the USSR and the United States, the conclusion and entry into force of treaties between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany,  the Quadripartite Agreement  on West Berlin all these represent an effective concretization of the idea of peaceful coexistence. What has been done brings benefits to all the parties concerned and is advantageous to all the peoples, since it serves the cause of peace and progress.\n60.\tThe Soviet-American summit talks were an event of major international significance. The Byelorussian people unanimously approves the results of these talks and the important documents signed in Moscow. The outcome of the Soviet-American talks have proved yet again that in today's conditions controversial international problems cannot be solved by the policy of proceeding from a \\\"position of strength\\\". They can and must be settled by\nnegotiation based upon observance of the principles of equality and equal security of the parties, respect for each other's interests and the general strengthening in international relations of the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social structures.\n61.\tNo objective person can fail to recognize that the documents signed in Moscow are not only advantageous and beneficial to the Soviet and American peoples. As the overwhelming majority of speakers from this rostrum have emphasized, they also promote the interests of all other peoples, the interests of a general relaxation of international tension. The issue now lies in implementing these treaties and agreements.\n62.\tIn pursuing their consistent, peace-loving foreign policy, the socialist States are advancing purposes and goals which are in conformity with the interests of strengthening peace and international security and are waging an unremitting struggle for their attainment. When the leaders of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, at their conference at Bucharest in July 1966,6 set out a program for the struggle for peace and security in Europe and proposed the convening of an all-European conference, this sincere appeal was met with a certain amount of skepticism in some Western quarters. Considerable efforts were required on the part of the socialist States and the peace-loving community to persuade the European countries to slough off the accretions of the past, to set aside outworn concepts and to take a fresh look at ways of strengthening peace and security in Europe. Yet it is truly a great aim to transform the European continent into a region of stable peace. And however hard they try, those speakers here who do not seem to like the idea of relaxation of tension in Europe and who are attempting by distorting the truth and juggling with words to substitute the word \\\"insecurity\\\" for the word \\\"security\\\", will not succeed in stemming the efforts of the peoples to strengthen peace and security on the European continent.\n63.\tThe principles of European security are clearly set out in the Declaration adopted in January this year in Prague at the Conference of the Political Advisory Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. They include first and foremost the inviolability of frontiers: any attempt to violate the existing frontiers which were established in Europe as the result of 'the Second World War would jeopardize European peace. Of great importance, too, are the other principles stated in the Declaration, such as the non-use of force, peaceful coexistence, good-neighborly relations and co-operation in the interests of peace, mutually advantageous ties between States, disarmament and support of the United Nations. All these are the lofty principles and purposes which must serve as a basis for relations between the States which will take part in the all-European conference.\n64.\tIt is now clear to everyone that a significant improvement has been achieved in the European situation. Now it is essential to move ahead, to take further steps towards the strengthening of peace on that continent, the creation of a reliable security system and the development of all-European co-operation. And one of the most urgent tasks at the present time is the prompt preparation and early convening of the all-European conference.\n65.\tThe interests of a relaxation of tension would also be served by the normalization of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the generally recognized norms of international law and by the settlement of problems outstanding between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, primarily that of declaring the Munich Agreement to be null and void ab initio.\n66.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR fully and whole-heartedly supports the views of those countries which consider that current developments also bring to the fore the question of creating a system of collective security in Asia. As Mr. L. I. Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has stated, such a system should be \\\"based on such premises as refraining from the use of force in relations between States, respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers, non-interference in domestic affairs and the broad development of economic and other forms of co-operation on the basis of fully equal rights and mutual advantage\\\". In these key directions the Asian States could unite their efforts in the interests of the peaceful future of their peoples.\n67.\tApart from the bilateral and regional efforts of States, great importance must be attached to the collective action of all countries with a view to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In this matter, the United Nations and, in particular, this session of its General Assembly, has a special part to play. The agenda which has been adopted for this session provides the most extensive possibilities in this regard. We have in mind the need to take positive decisions on such vital questions as \\\"Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [item 25], \\\"World Disarmament Conference\\\" [item 26], \\\"Implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security\\\" [item 35], \\\"The situation in the Middle East\\\" [item 21], \\\"Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples\\\" [item 22], \\\"Preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting\\\" [item 37], \\\"Principles of international co-operation in the detection, arrest, extradition and punishment of persons guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity\\\" [item 52], \\\"Report of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression\\\" [item 88] and many other issues.\n68.\tThe United Nations has on a number of occasions reaffirmed in its decisions the key principle of the United Nations Charter concerning the inadmissibility of the threat or use of force in. international relations and the necessity of settling controversial problems exclusively by peaceful means. Further, a Declaration on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear and Thermo-nuclear Weapons was adopted [resolution 1653 (XVI)] which provides that \\\"any State using nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons is to be considered as violating the Charter of the United Nations, as acting contrary to the laws of humanity and as committing a crime against mankind and civilization\\\". The United Nations has also advocated the conclusion of an international convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.\n69.\tThe dire consequences of imperialist aggression using conventional weapons in conflicts and wars during recent years are well known to everyone. The United Nations has also made a study of the catastrophic consequences for all mankind of the possible use of nuclear weapons.\n70.\tThe time has come to take the next step, that is to say, to consolidate the will already expressed by States Members of the United Nations and, as it is proposed in the draft resolution of the USSR delegation [A/L.676], to make a solemn declaration on the renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and to give such a declaration binding force through adoption of an appropriate decision by the Security Council, to which Members of the United Nations are obliged to submit, under Article 25 of the Charter.\n71.\tSuch a decision will fully comply with the principle of ensuring equal security for all States, will promote the termination of existing armed conflicts and will prevent them in the future. At the same time, as Mr. A. A. Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, pointed out in his statement [2040th meeting], the obligation of countries to refrain from the use of force, including nuclear weapons, in no way affects their rights to individual and collective self-defense, affirmed in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, or the inalienable rights of States and peoples subjected to aggression to resist such aggression, or the rights of colonial peoples to struggle for their freedom and independence.\n72.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR calls upon all delegations to reject firmly the fabrications of any speaker who asserts that a reduction of the danger of nuclear or any other form of aggression will be detrimental to everyone, and it urges them to lend active support to the important initiative of the USSR, which serves the cause of strengthening the peace and security of all peoples.\n73.\tDisarmament continues to be one of the most important problems confronting the international community. This problem is of universal concern and it is therefore essential for all States without exception to concentrate their maximum efforts on its solution. In this connexion we fully agree with those speakers who stated that disarmament is the keystone of the activities of the United Nations.\n74.\tThe peoples are naturally particularly concerned by the problem of nuclear disarmament. Its successful solution might be furthered by convening a conference of the five nuclear Powers, an idea which has been advanced by the Government of the Soviet Union.  Such a conference could play an important part in the practical implementation of measures for the elimination of this dangerous weapon.\n75.\tThe Byelorussian SSR has advanced specific proposals on the question of convening a world disarmament conference in its letter to the Secretary-General [see A)8817, annex IJ. At this time, we shall merely stress once again that the General Assembly should discuss constructively the whole complex of questions relating to the convening of this conference and should take positive decisions which will allow preparations for it to be started, despite the opposition of individual objectors.\n76.\tWe still have before us the problem of the speedy elimination of chemical weapons from the military arsenals of States. As we know, the socialist countries, including the Byelorussian SSR, have submitted to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament a draft Convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction [see A/8818-DC/235, annex B (CCD/361)], which can serve as a good basis for the preparation of a definitive agreement. This draft was drawn up with due consideration for the opinions and positions expressed by many States, both in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and in the General Assembly.\n77.\tIn the circumstances the General Assembly should take steps to activate the question of the elimination of chemical weapons, in order that agreement on the problem may be reached without any unnecessary delay, since every partial disarmament measure is a step towards general and complete disarmament, that ultimate goal for which all negotiations in the sphere of disarmament are being conducted.\n78.\tWith regard to the problem of strengthening inter-national security, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR notes with satisfaction that the basic provisions of the Declaration on this subject adopted at the twenty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)] have become a standard for the foreign policy activities of the overwhelming majority of States. As a result of this, the general trend towards the normalization and improvement of the international situation has been further developed and States are undertaking endeavors at the bilateral and regional levels to promote the strengthening of the security of nations. Under these circumstances, in taking measures for the elimination of military hotbeds and conflicts existing in various parts of the world, we think that it would be desirable to support the efforts of States to set up regional security systems and to call upon States to conduct negotiations with a view to concluding bilateral and multilateral agreements on co-operation in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security on the basis of undeviating observance of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States.\n79.\tIt is self-evident that regional security systems should in no way be directed against any other States. They should be the instruments of voluntary co-operation between all the States of the region concerned and should completely preclude attempts of the kind still being made to set certain States against others or attempts to divide the nations by establishing military blocs or groupings.\n80.\tWhile noting with satisfaction the advances which have recently been occurring in the world, as well as the existing possibilities for the solution of a number of problems, we are nevertheless obliged to note that the military conflicts continuing for many years in various parts of the world are hindering the normal course of international development and the improvement of the international situation.\n81.\tThe events in IndoChina are a cause of serious anxiety. While broadly advertising the withdrawal of part of its land forces from South Viet-Nam, the United States has expanded its air warfare to a hitherto unprecedented scale. The American air force is bombing civilian targets, peaceful cities and population centers, is mining ports, is destroying crops, plantations and forests and, most recently, has been destroying dikes and irrigation works.\n82.\tBut barbarism and cruelty will not break the spirit of the peoples of IndoChina. Their courageous struggle is gaining increasing support throughout the world. The Byelorussian people, like all Soviet peoples, expresses its solidarity with the peoples of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia in their legitimate struggle and calls for the immediate cessation of United States aggression in IndoChina. The well-known proposals advanced by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, the National United Front of Cambodia and the Laotian Patriotic Front provide a constructive and realistic basis for the solution of the IndoChinese problem.\n83.\tDuring the period that has elapsed since the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly, no positive changes have occurred with regard to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. One report after another has been received concerning Israel's aggressive actions against the neighboring Arab States and the aggressors' new criminal acts in the occupied territories. The rulers of Israel, neglecting the fate of their own people, continue to adhere to the policy of aggression and territorial expansion.\n84.\tAll the actions of the Israeli rulers over the past period bear witness to the fact that they are determined once again to torpedo the mission of Mr. Jarring, as well as any other effort of the United Nations to attain a stable peace in the Middle East.\n85.\tThere can be no question that as long as the Israeli aggressors continue to occupy Arab land, the situation in the Middle East will remain explosive. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories and the implementation of all the other provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) would serve as a basis for the establishment of lasting peace in the Middle East. To attain this goal it is essential, at this session, to unify the collective action of all countries, making use of all the possibilities offered by the United Nations Charter.\n86.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR decisively rejects the demagogic and slanderous allegations made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel in his statement in the general debate [2045th meeting], the purpose of which amounted to misleading public opinion, dividing the Arab countries, undermining the efforts of the anti-imperialist forces to achieve a peaceful political settlement in the Middle East and interfering in the domestic affairs of other States. In connexion with his attempts to interfere in the domestic affairs of, the USSR, I shall only say the following: the hat is too big and cannot be fitted on to Zionist heads, even with the help of powerful protectors.\n87.\tAn important factor for strengthening peace and international security is the intensification of the role of the United Nations in the solution of important international problems, the enhancement of its effectiveness and authority. To this end, the first requirement is strict and undeviating observance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter by all States, together with renunciation of all attempts to revise the United Nations Charter. In order, to enable the United Nations fully to respond to the requirements of contemporary life, it is essential to cast aside the ignominious legacy of past years and the decisions imposed on the United Nations by the imperialist forces in violation of the Charter.\n88.\tUnited Nations interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people must cease and discrimination against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the United Nations must be brought to an end. The Byelorussian SSR is a sponsor of an agenda item entitled \\\"Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea\\\"  and has made active representations for the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We did this because of the necessity of a speedy solution to the problem of the withdrawal of American and all other foreign troops which are occupying South Korea under the flag of the United Nations and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea, thus laying the foundations for the reunification of Korea on peaceful and democratic bases by the Korean people themselves, without any outside interference.\n89.\tWith regard to problems of decolonization, may I say that we advocate the full implementation of United Nations decisions on the abolition of remaining colonial regimes and the eradication of racism and apartheid. Our delegation condemns the actions of the colonial Powers which are hampering the implementation of the Declaration on the elimination of colonialism [resolution 1514 (XV)], including their military activities in dependent Territories, their use of the veto against the proposals of the African and Asian countries in the Security Council, their supply of arms to the racist regimes in southern Africa, the violation of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia, particularly in the form of chrome purchases by American monopolies, and the constantly increasing support given by the leading countries of NATO to the racist and colonial regimes in the Republic of South Africa, Portugal and Southern Rhodesia. The Byelorussian SSR resolutely supports the struggle of the peoples of colonial Territories for their freedom and independence.\n90.\tMany delegations rightly paid considerable attention to the problems of economic development. We share the views of those who advocate the expansion of co-operation among all countries, on the basis of equal rights, in commercial, economic, scientific and technical matters. Such co-operation is bound to lead to a rise in the standard of living of peoples, to promote social and economic advancement in all parts of the world and to exclude all direct or indirect pressure on States which are undertaking progressive social and economic transformations. Our delegation has always defended the right of the peoples of the developing countries to complete sovereignty over their natural resources and to the development of their economies in the interests of their populations. We support the right of the peoples of the developing countries to assume full control over the activities of foreign monopolies in their territories, including problems of the influx and outflow of foreign capital, the distribution of profits and changes in the status of national and foreign property.\n91.\tIt is also important to ensure that the activities of regional and other commercial and economic organizations grouping various countries together should not cause damage to the interests of other countries and to international commercial and economic co-operation and also that the various commercial and economic associations of States should observe the principles of reciprocity and equal rights in their relations among themselves.\n92.\tWe attach particular importance to the attainment of universality in the United Nations and insistently advocate the admission of the German Democratic Republic, as well as the Federal Republic of Germany, as Members of the United Nations. We also urge that the Security Council should reconsider the application of the People's Republic of Bangladesh [A/8754-SJ10759] and should open the door to membership in the United Nations to that new Asian State. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR considers it essential to put an end to discrimination against countries which are not Members of the United Nations in granting them the right to send their observers to the United Nations even before the question of their admission to the Organization is settled. We have in mind primarily the urgent need to comply with the justified requests of the German Democratic Republic to be allowed to have its observers at the United Nations.\n93.\tThe position we have stated with regard to major issues is an expression of the consistency and attachment to principle characterizing the foreign policy course pursued by the land of the Soviets which, together with the other socialist States and peace-loving forces, is carrying on a policy of peace, friendship and equal rights among the peoples, is combating colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and all forms of national oppression, is counteracting the aggressive strategy of imperialism and reaction and is actively campaigning against expansionist wars, for the security and freedom of the peoples and for social progress.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a distinct pleasure on this opening day of the general debate to welcome you to your high office and to congratulate you on the distinction which your devoted national service and your country's contribution to the affairs of the international community have earned for you personally and for Poland, and to pledge to you the support of my delegation as, throughout this session, you guide the deliberations of the Assembly with wisdom and fairness.\n101.\tAs I do so, Mr. President, may I join in the tributes already paid to your distinguished predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Adam Malik, for the standards of excellence which characterized the discharge of his responsibilities during the last session. It is a source of particular satisfaction to the Government and people of Guyana that we should have been able to welcome him to our country before the twenty-seventh session began. This Organization and the international community stand greatly indebted to Mr. Malik for the service he has given in so many ways over several years of personal contribution, but most especially, of course, in respect of his work as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n102.\tMay I also be permitted, in these early hours of the twenty-seventh session, to convey to our distinguished Secretary-General the congratulations of the Government and people of Guyana, and my personal congratulations, on his elevation to the high and exacting office to which he was elected in the closing moments of the twenty-sixth session. I wish to assure him that he may look with certainty to Guyana for all such assistance and support as is within our power to give, in all his efforts to uphold the principles of the Charter and to secure for an impatient world the attainment of the aims and objectives of the Organization.\n103.\tThe commencement of each new session of this Assembly is, in effect, a renewal of the pledge made by the peoples of the world on the establishment of the United Nations. That pledge, as embodied in the Charter, and the promise of a better world which it implied, are as relevant and as valid today as they were in 1945. Each session of this Assembly is, therefore, both an occasion of commitment and an occasion of opportunity. The fact that so many of the leaders of the world will participate in this general debate should be sufficient testimony to our commitment and to our determination to use the opportunities of the session to advance the objectives of the Organization.\n104.\tBut it would be idle to pretend that this is how we are seen by the vast majority of those of the world's people who take an interest in our proceedings. The level of their skepticism is the measure of our annual failures. How to reduce that level, how to redress those failures, how to match our performance to our protestations is the real challenge of each Assembly. Unless we accept that challenge squarely, we shall in this Assembly still further diminish the chances of success which attend not only our own efforts here but those of all other organs of the United Nations, of the Secretary-General and his officers, of the specialized agencies, of the Security Council itself.\n105.\tIt is, therefore, to these wider perspectives of commitment and of opportunity that I invite attention, rather than to the particular issues with which the Assembly and its Committees will be concerned in the months ahead. To the resolution of these issues my delegation will, in due course, offer the modest contribution of a small State, informed by the considerations of principle which I shall attempt to outline.\n106.\tIt is perhaps in the nature of man that resolution diminishes as urgency recedes. Had it been otherwise, the determination to ensure a regime of peace, of justice and of progress in the world which was the genesis of this Organization would have been sustained long after the scourge of war and the untold sorrow it had brought to mankind had passed. If, indeed, it be so-and the record of this Organization's work, despite its many notable achievements, all too readily bears witness that it is there is a manifest need for each Assembly to be alerted to the several scourges that still darken the prospect of a peaceful, just and habitable world.\n107.\tBut merely to chronicle these deficiencies and imperfections, these dangers and uncertainties, is not enough; for does not their very existence signify the complacency and indeed the indifference of a world in which those who exercise the power of decision-making or control the means of implementation are willing to make an accommodation with them? Can there be hope of sustained resolution, therefore, can there be expectation that professed commitment will be translated into durable reality, so long as the acknowledged crisis in international affairs does not threaten imminent national disaster, or at least imminent national disaster for the major Powers? If there is, indeed, a possibility that the answer can be yes that resolution may be sustained, that commitment may be fulfilled-that possibility would seem to lie in the emergence of some consciousness of global need, of which mankind otherwise becomes possessed.\n108.\tIn the area of human consciousness, developments unfold slowly. Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to be sure when ideas nurtured slowly emerge fully into the consciousness of men. It is just possible, however, that within our own time we may be seeing the emergence of an idea which has hitherto appeared only as a hint or a glimmer of truth but which possesses the potential of moving mankind with a new resolution and a revived urgency.\n109.\tIn its beginnings, the current perception that the preservation of tire environment must be tire concern of all mankind derived from the perception of the developed States that the pollution which accompanies their major industries can endanger and irretrievably damage life- support systems of air, land and water on our planet Earth. Out of this perception there has emerged, principally but not exclusively in the developed world, a growing concern over disturbances to the ecological balance of the biosphere and a new awareness of the finiteness of the world's resources of ocean, atmosphere and land, a concern and an awareness which are beginning to exert an influence on matters that affect the peace of the world and the quality of life on earth. We are, in fact, witnessing the birth of a new sense of community between man and the other life forms, a sense of belonging to and living together on a small planetary body whose limited resources are the heritage of all life.\n110.\tFew will doubt that this insight marks a further advance in man's development. It would greatly diminish that advance, however-indeed, it might altogether frustrate it-if this perception of the interdependence of life is held at the level of concern from which it derived and its deeper implications for man's relationship with man are not acknowledged and pursued. The belief that the acknowledgment and pursuit of these implications are unavoidable, the recognition that it would be futile to develop a planetary strategy based on the unity of man with other life forms while ignoring those factors of inequality that frustrate and destroy the unity of mankind, and those realities of tension and conflict that impair the quality and threaten the existence of human life itself-each is reason enough to hope that we may be at a point of special significance in the evolution of international community effort.\n111.\tThe Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment sustains this hope by its implicit acceptance that the physical interdependence of all people requires new dimensions of economic, social and political interdependence; by its express proclamation of man's \\\"fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being\\\";  by its demand that \\\"policies promoting or perpetuating apartheid, racial segregation, discrimination, colonial and other forms of oppression and foreign domination stand condemned and must be eliminated\\\"; by its acknowledgment that environmental problems are products not merely of industrial development but of under-development, that, for the developing countries, their development must be a priority bearing in mind the need to safeguard and improve the environment and that, for the same purpose, the industrialized countries should make efforts to reduce the gap between themselves and the developing world.\n112.\tThese particular asseverations and exhortations are, of course, not new. They stand inscribed in many an international convention for which this Organization itself has been responsible. What is new is that they now stand inscribed as concomitant features of a program for human survival, a program inspired by the desperate understanding that \\\"to defend and improve the human environment for present and future generations has become an imperative goal for mankind\\\" a program that derives from mutual need and demands the reciprocal efforts of all States and peoples.\n113.\tIt needs to be appreciated that in the developing world this concept of mutuality is of paramount importance in any assessment of these developments. programs for the preservation of the human environment deriving mainly from abuses of the environment by the developed countries will stand little chance of universal respect, and therefore of success, unless conceived in terms which acknowledge the new dimensions of economic, social and political interdependence.\n114.\tIn moving, therefore, to a new level of planetary consultation it is essential that there be kept on the agenda all items that bear upon the quality of human life, so that the full resources of the planetary community are brought to their resolution. It may have been arguable that some of these matters were outside the purview of the Stockholm Conference. They cannot be outside the purview of this Assembly; nor can they be other than directly relevant to that wider concept of environment to which I have referred and which is already a part of our contemporary thought.\n115.\tLet us acknowledge, for example, that not only have the agents of apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa resorted to deliberate destruction of the natural environment but the system itself is built on the denial to some men of what is in fact the natural heritage of all mankind: the right to a life of dignity in freedom and equality. Is it conceivable that one can develop a planetary strategy on the basis of respect for other life when human life itself is subjected to such systematized maltreatment? Racism, whatever form it takes, whether openly defiant or in masquerade, whoever its proponents and whoever its victims, pollutes and contaminates the human environment and deserves universal condemnation as it requires universal redress.\n116.\tAnd while we ponder man's inhumanities in southern Africa, let us not ignore, or by silence appear to condone, those other abuses of the human personality that have in recent times brought concern and distress to all who labor in the vineyard of international brotherhood. A year ago, from this podium, I suggested, in relation to other cruel and indifferent onslaughts on human dignity:\n\\\". . that gross violations of human rights wherever they occur in the world are the legitimate concern of the international community; and that matters cease to be essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a State when they give rise to humanitarian issues of such magnitude that the international community must of necessity grapple with them\\\" [1943rd meeting, para. 139.J\n117.\tThese considerations are as apposite now as then, and my Government has already assured the Secretary-General of support for his efforts to secure a humanitarian approach to the problems of human despair and dislocation in the troubled land of Uganda-problems, let it be acknowledged, which had their beginnings in colonialism. Mindful of the character of our State as a land of many peoples, my Government has likewise indicated its willingness to render such assistance as the circumstances of a small and developing State will permit to those who may be threatened with the terrifying prospect of statelessness.\n118.\tIn indoChina, for more than a generation, its people and their environment have been subjected to the prolonged devastation of war-a war which is protracted in response to the power rivalries of external forces. The human environment is not divisible. We cannot secure its preservation in Stockholm if we allow its devastation in Viet-Nam. The ending of conflict in IndoChina is the concern of all men, and the international community, and this Organization in particular, have both a right and a duty to exert an influence in securing it.\n119.\tAnd how do we interpret the concept of \\\"an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being\\\" to the people of Palestine who have been dispossessed of environment itself? As we rightly condemn an international terrorism that strikes indiscriminately at innocent youth and makes the postal authorities of 'the world unconscious messengers of death, let us not forget for it is to the account of all mankind the bitterness and despair arising from deprivation of homeland that lie behind such desperate and abhorrent acts.\n120.\tAs we respond to the Secretary-General's proposal to search at this twenty-seventh session for solutions to these problems, let us not believe that we can achieve durable results while ignoring those root-causes that produce them or delude ourselves with formulations that bury those causes still deeper in calculated ambiguity.\n121.\tWe cannot afford such delusion; for, suddenly, the world has grown smaller, so that there is no here and beyond, no island of tranquility in a sea of turbulence, no peace anywhere while despair stalks the planet. Are these realities of our time not also an aspect of that perception of interdependence which the concept of environment has sharpened; and should we not begin as a planetary community to accept and to deal with them on these terms? When we do, it may perhaps become easier to recognize that each time the Security Council, through threat or use of the reciprocal veto, fails to discharge its primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security we increase still further the frustrations that impel both indiscriminate political violence and no less indiscriminate retaliation; for each such failure still further reduces credibility in the effectiveness of the United Nations and therefore of collective international opinion. The effectiveness of both is essential to global survival.\n122.\tSimilar considerations must inform the effort to redress the difference in levels of economic development. It is a sad commentary on our contemporary internationalism that the Stockholm Conference and the third session of UNCTAD could have been events on the international calendar of the same year. The emphasis placed during the debate at Stockholm on\n\\\". .. the fact that for two thirds of the world's population the human environment was dominated by poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy and misery, and that the urgent task facing mankind was to solve those immediate and formidable problems .. .\\\" \nwas reflected in the Declaration itself, which acknowledged that\n\\\"Environmental deficiencies generated by the conditions of under-development... can best be remedied by accelerated development through the transfer of substantial quantities of financial and technological assistance as a supplement to the domestic effort of the developing countries. .. .\\\" \nThe Declaration acknowledged also that:\n\\\"For the developing countries, stability of prices and adequate earnings for primary commodities and raw material are essential to environmental management since economic factors as well as ecological processes must be taken into account.\\\"13\nBut these very truths, so candidly acknowledged at Stockholm, had a few weeks earlier failed to produce commitments at Santiago.\n123.\tWhat is needed is prompt, translation of such acknowledgments into tangible commitments and early fulfillment of these commitments and of obligations that already exist under the International Development Strategy. And this movement from acknowledgment to fulfillment must cover the whole field of international economic co-operation.\n124.\tIt must be evidenced, for example, in the forthcoming trade negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GAIT] so that at both procedural and substantive levels there is a substantial and continuing improvement in the position of the developing countries in international trade.\n125.\tIt must find expression in reform of the international monetary system which admits the developing countries to full participation in the decision-making processes rather than leaves them the mere hapless victims of recurring international monetary crises for which they bear no responsibility.\n126.\tAll these will be necessary if we are to apply the new insight of environment not merely defensively, in order to hold off the environmental perils that confront industrialized societies, but positively and purposefully, in order to create conditions on earth that will preserve and enhance for every citizen of the world an environment which truly gives him that \\\"physical sustenance\\\" and affords him that \\\"opportunity for intellectual, moral, social and spiritual growth\\\" of which the Declaration speaks, and which gives and affords them to him on an active and equal basis with all other men.\n127.\tPerhaps no area of current international activity more obviously demands the application of this insight than the current effort to regulate human interaction in the ocean space beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Any perception of the earth as the heritage of all mankind must lend urgency to the arrangements for the international Conference on the Law of the Sea. But it must also surely serve to ensure, once the Conference on The Law of the Sea is convened, that an international regime is established which meets the legitimate demands of the developing no less than those of the developed countries, of the landlocked no less than the coastal States, and that it accommodates all these with the overriding interest of the international community in an orderly and equitable development whose benefits accrue to the people of the world and can be used to solve those prevailing environmental problems which are the products of under-development.\n128.\tThe Stockholm Declaration acknowledges that:\n\\\"Millions continue to live far below the minimum levels required for a decent human existence, deprived of adequate food and clothing, shelter and education, health and sanitation.\\\"14\nLet the resources of the sea and the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, which are the heritage of all mankind, have as a first charge upon them the redress of these social and economic imbalances; let them be devoted, that is, to the fulfillment of the first principle of the Declaration-the realization of man's \\\"fundamental right to ... adequate conditions of life, in an environment of equality that permits a life of dignity and well being .. .\\\".15 A regime of the sea and the sea-bed which thus gives practical fulfillment to the new perception of the unity of man's life with other life would lay sturdy foundations on which we may yet build a more just and therefore a more enduring international system.\n129.\tLet us also, in the cause of preserving and enhancing the human environment, give support and encouragement to efforts for the establishment of zones of peace and co-operation in various regions of the world based on the principles of the Charter and on the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] so that in their aggregation these zones of peace may advance the cause of comprehensive international security.\n130.\tIn this context, let this Assembly help to advance the implementation of the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] adopted at the twenty-sixth session and let it likewise endorse and call upon all States to respect the objective embodied in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 27 November 1971, in which five countries of South-east Asia have expressed their determination to secure recognition of and respect for South-east Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from any form of menace or interference by outside Powers.\n131.\tPerhaps above all let this new awareness of mutual need confirm the urgency of the democratization of international relations. The tendency on the part of the major Powers to monopolize decision-making or to exercise inordinate influence on matters which are the proper concern of all countries continues to be a feature of international life a tendency which the institutional arrangements of this Organization greatly assist by fashioning the Security Council to reflect power differentials between States. Thus, while we welcome the indications of detente among the super-Powers, we must ensure by appropriate reforms that the dialog of peace which it permits is one for all mankind and is not confined within the Chancelleries of a small syndicate of powerful States in negation of the purposes of this Organization.\n132.\tBut the processes of democratization will take many forms and high among them must be the universality of membership of this Organization. The restoration of the People's Republic of China to its rightful place in the Organization was an important step in this direction, but further steps must be taken to secure the objective of universality. We must open the doors of this Organization to all those States that seek to enter, and we must encourage those others now without to exercise their influence on international affairs from within the Organization by assuring them of our support for their admission, notwithstanding the problems of division that may have hindered this in the past.\n133.\tBut if we are to ensure that the universality of the Organization is effective we will need to go beyond the question of membership and to secure a more broadly- \nbased geographic representation of the people of the world in the principal organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the secretariats of these organizations, and particularly at the policy-making levels. In the long run the major Powers themselves may find that a willingness on their part to take these steps towards making the conduct of international affairs more democratic would better secure the prospect of international peace and co-operation than a stubborn adherence to the power political structure of a passing era.\n134.\tThrough all these growing points in our international arrangements it is clearly possible for us to move away from a system in which the use of power or the balance of power is the determinant of change to one in which there is growing acceptance of a complementarity of systems within a single planetary community a community in which change is promoted by conciliation and adjustment and is responsive to a balanced view of the needs of all its peoples. With the emergence of such a planetary order this Organization will assume even greater responsibilities, and it must therefore be a central feature of all our efforts that we enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations.\n135.\tFor this reason alone the financial plight of the Organization ought to be the concern of all Member States; for these financial problems must impose severe strains on the capacity of the Organization to fulfill even its present functions, much less to equip itself for still further responsibilities. We are, indeed, at a stage in the affairs of the United Nations when it should be the duty of all Member States committed to its effectiveness to take those steps that are necessary to a resolution of existing financial difficulties and to avoid any that are likely to diminish that effectiveness or imperil its legitimate and necessary growth.\n136.\tI spoke a moment ago on the growing points of our international arrangements. High among these, I suggest, is the developing strength of the non-aligned movement, whose most recent consultation, at the level of Foreign Ministers,  it was my country's privilege to host just six weeks ago. Nearly two decades before that, at the African- Asian Conference, held at Bandung in April 1955, leaders of a number of Afro-Asian nations had met to demonstrate their newly won freedom, to renew the links between their peoples which had been broken in imperial times and to seek to ensure through solidarity that the momentum of the independence struggle was maintained. They elaborated at Bandung a set of principles on which the international movement of non-alignment was to be shaped. These principles have informed the program hammered out at the great consultations of the movement.\n137.\tAt Belgrade in 1961,  at a time of heightened international tension, the leaders of the non-aligned nations sought to secure the peace of the world through efforts of mediation. At Cairo in 1964,  at a time of lessened tension, they emphasized the need for a program to reshape the international economic system and its institutions and called upon developed States for practical co-operation. At Lusaka in 1970,  the emphasis was on the need to democratize international relations and, through self-reliance and mutual assistance, to widen the areas of co-operation among developing States.\n138.\tEach of these responses to the challenges and opportunities of the changing international situation was founded on a commitment to those very principles which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to the advancement of the effectiveness of the United Nations. Today the non-aligned movement, which numbers among its adherents half of the Members of this Assembly, stands foremost among the champions of this Organization and of its aims and objectives.\n139.\tAt the Conference of Foreign Ministers held recently in Georgetown this commitment to the United Nations, already elaborately expressed at Lusaka, was reaffirmed and . the Foreign. Ministers rededicated themselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter and reaffirmed their deep conviction that the United Nations provides the most effective means to maintain and promote international peace and security, to strengthen freedom and to harmonize relations between States. They reiterated that the United Nations must not merely reflect developments in contemporary world affairs but, by exerting an influence upon them, contribute to the furtherance of world peace and progress.\n140.\tIn its commitment to this Organization, in its efforts in the cause of international peace and security, in its resolute support of fundamental human values and the cause of economic and social justice and, above all, in its steadfastness to the concept of a world of free people and free States, the non-aligned movement is continuing its contribution to the achievement of the aims and objectives of the Charter.\n141.\tOn the mandate of the Conference, at the commencement of this session I transmitted its Final Acts to the Secretary-General and requested their circulation as official documents of the United Nations. I have no doubt that as the work of this session proceeds the Georgetown Declaration, the Action program for Economic Cooperation and the related documents of the Conference will make a material contribution to the resolution of outstanding issues.\n142.\tOn the occasion of the Georgetown Conference this great movement that knows no boundaries of race or region, of language or of political system, did honor to the pioneers of non-alignment and, more especially, to the international work for a better world of four great men whose vision reached beyond their national horizons and whose courage inspired and advanced a new and more democratic international system. I should like to read into the records of this Assembly the words in which we commemorated those contributions of Gamal Abdel Nasser, of Kwame Nkrumah, of Jawaharlal Nehru, of Josip Broz Tito for all the world is heir to their achievements and the epilogue to their great works may serve also as the prologue to a new chapter of the chronicle of man's endeavors in his restless quest for peace and understanding with himself and with his environment. The words of commemoration read:\n\\\"Having led their peoples to freedom They did not rest But taking the whole earth for their nation And all peoples for their brothers They sought to free the world from war Gave to the oppressed a sense of dignity and the hope of justice\nEnsured for all peoples the right to freedom and independence\nAnd to determine and pursue without hindrance The paths of their political economic social and cultural development\nSecured for all States respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity And the right of equality and active participation in international affairs\nWith them through the Movement of Non-Alignment Our human race took a step forward Towards a world of peace of justice and of progress They began a dialog of all mankind.\\\"\n143.\tIf we are to continue that dialog and to give it the dimensions which our new awareness of man's state on this planet requires, there will be need for an effort of truly global proportions in which all men and all States must share. As communication begins to take the place of threat, as bridges are built where barriers stood, as functional co-operation broadens to encompass the survival of life on earth, the need is urgent and the moment propitious for us to make that effort. As we do so, there is no higher priority than to integrate the emerging values into the developing international system. On our willingness to do this in a total way, responsive to the needs of no one community or group of communities but to the needs of mankind seen in their widest perspectives, will depend our chances of advancing towards the ideal of a peaceful, just and habitable planet.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Japanese delegation, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your assumption of the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that your outstanding knowledge and vision and rich experience in the United Nations will lead this session of the General Assembly to a fruitful conclusion.\n2.\tAt the same time, I wish to express my profound appreciation to Mr. Adam Malik, the former President of the General Assembly. It still remains fresh in our memory that the success of the exceedingly eventful twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly was to a great extent attributable to his outstanding leadership.\n3.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to express my deep respect to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, four esteemed Secretary- General. Although he assumed this high post not too long ago, he is traveling and sparing no efforts to ensure world peace and to consolidate the basis of the United Nations. I hope that the Secretary-General will continue his endeavors through his dynamic activities for the strengthening of world peace and the further enhancement of the prestige of the United Nations.\n4.\tAs various countries have become more closely and extensively interrelated in the political, economic, social, cultural and other fields, international relations have become more diverse and complex. The world of today is characterized, first, by the trend towards the relaxation of international tensions and, second, by progress in international co-operation . in many different fields. This is a tendency welcome to the United Nations, which aims at the maintenance of international peace and security as well as the strengthening of international co-operation.\n5.\tOn the other hand, conflicts over many fundamental questions have not yet been completely resolved in various parts of the world, and some questions have come to assume even greater complexity.\n6.\tIn this world of today, I believe that the role to be played by the United Nations has become increasingly diversified and has acquired added importance. At the same time, I wish to emphasize the ever greater need for the United Nations to deal with the many questions before it, analyzing carefully the nature of each case on the basis of a sufficient understanding of realities. In the present international situation it is not a constructive position either to overestimate the United Nations by expecting too much of it or, conversely, to underestimate it by expecting too little of it. It is my firm conviction that today, of all times, the United Nations is expected to make its steadfast endeavors in a realistic manner, so that its prestige may be enhanced.\n7.\tWith that realistic manner in mind, I wish to stress certain aspects of the role of the United Nations against the background of the present international situation and to try, at the same time, to view in perspective what the future United Nations should be.\n8.\tThe main trend of international relations for these past several years has been characterized by the transition from an age of chronic tensions created by the intense confrontation between the Eastern and the Western blocs to an age of relaxation of tensions against the background of the so-called multi-polarization of power. The talks which took place in the first half of this year between the United States and China and between the United States and the Soviet Union were events which have further accelerated such tendencies. In Europe, agreement on the Berlin question was reached among the States concerned, and the relaxation of tension in Europe is progressing steadily.\n9.\tConcurrently, in the various regions of Asia there is a gradually growing common awareness that peace and stability in the area should be ensured by means of mutual understanding and co-operation among the nations.\n10.\tThe Government of Japan believes that the current visit of Prime Minister Tanaka to China and the summit talks between the leaders of the two countries will contribute to the relaxation of tension in Asia and ultimately to the promotion of world peace, if a foundation is firmly laid thereby for establishing neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries.\nA/PV.2042\n11.\tYesterday from this rostrum the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Mr. Gromyko, referred to the forthcoming negotiations for a peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union [2040th meeting, para. 55]. The Government of Japan is convinced that the conclusion of a peace treaty to solve the unsettled issues between the two countries would greatly contribute not only to the furthering of neighborly and friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union but also to the promotion of peace and stability in Asia and indeed in the whole world. Japan's desire for the success of these talks is, to say the least, not less than anybody else's.\n12.\tIn the Korean peninsula, the way has been paved for a direct dialog, and the spontaneous efforts for the settlement of questions between South Korea and North Korea have begun to take concrete shape, as is evidenced in the Red Cross talks between the South and the North, as well as in the joint Communique of the Governments of North and South Korea of 4 July [Al8727, annex I]. These trends are of course most welcome to the United Nations, which has always taken an active interest in the peaceful unification of Korea. It is essential that the United Nations should continue to keep a sympathetic eye on such dialogs between South and North Korea so that they may bear tangible fruits as soon as possible.\n13.\tFurthermore, among the Asian States there have been noteworthy trends towards regional co-operation among the neighboring nations and the settlement of questions of common concern, as illustrated by the recent moves of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. To our gratification, the Simla Agreement has been reached on 3 July 1972 between India and Pakistan, and efforts of reconciliation are under way among the States concerned. I hope that the day will soon come when Bangladesh will be admitted to the United Nations.\n14.\tIt goes without saying that the tendency towards the relaxation of tension observed in various parts of the world is to be welcomed by the United Nations as the Organization responsible for the maintenance of international peace. The development of spontaneous endeavors in Asia is a particularly welcome move in the light of the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which attaches importance to the maintenance and strengthening of peace through regional co-operation. I am convinced that the United Nations should continue to view with appreciation these spontaneous endeavors among the States concerned and demonstrate its readiness to extend assistance, whenever necessary, in order to make such endeavors more fruitful.\n15.\tIn contrast with these favorable developments, unfortunate circumstances remain in various parts of the world where disputes or situations persist but where there is no forum for direct talks between the parties concerned or where no direct contact has yet led to any constructive achievements. In the IndoChinese peninsula, armed conflicts still continue, and it seems that the prospect for peace is still uncertain. Japan welcomes the resumption of the Paris peace talks and sincerely hopes that real peace will be brought about in this area as soon as possible through negotiations between the parties concerned.\n16.\tWith reference to the Middle East, there has been an incessant eruption of violence and reprisal, as all of us have observed in the recent series of tragic events. Japan took an active part from the outset in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and has ever since been exerting its maximum efforts, within and .outside the Security Council, so that the States concerned may as promptly as possible establish a lasting peace through a spirit of self-restraint and accommodation. We ardently hope that the United Nations will continue to tackle this question in a most positive manner.\n17.\tFurthermore, another task not spectacular but extremely meaningful- that the United Nations can undertake is to create the basic conditions that would be conducive to the establishment of peace in the area. In this respect, I evaluate highly the activities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East [UNR WA], which is dealing with relief aid for the nearly 1.5 million Palestinian Arab refugees. Japan is determined to continue to contribute positively to ensuring peace in the area by strengthening and expanding further the scale of its co-operation with the relief work of UNRWA.\n18.\tThe continuation of the policy of racial discrimination and illegal minority rule in southern Africa constitutes a source of incessant tension in that region. My country has a full understanding of the sincere endeavors which African States have been making towards the goal of achieving self-determination and the elimination of racial discrimination and believes that the United Nations should further intensify its constructive efforts towards the earliest possible solution of these problems by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of its Charter. Particularly under the present circumstances, in which direct talks between the parties concerned have become virtually impossible, it is my firm belief that the United Nations should be utilized in a more positive and constructive manner as a forum for consultations in which the parties concerned participate. The settlement of the questions related to southern Africa, naturally requires a patient and practical approach. In this sense, it is highly commendable that the Secretary-General has been conducting dialogs with all the parties concerned, including the Government of the Republic of South Africa, and has achieved some encouraging progress in respect of the question of Namibia, regarding which an impasse has persisted for so many years.\n19.\tI have touched upon several points concerning what role the United Nations can play in solving major problems facing the world today. In the light of the trends towards detente apparent in today's world, I would point out that it is of vital importance for the United Nations to support, encourage and render positive assistance to further such trends in a timely and flexible manner, instead of remaining an indifferent bystander. It is an undeniable fact that a number of problems in which the peace and security of the world were involved were placed under the close observation and scrutiny of the entire international community through the public debates of the United Nations, and catastrophe was thereby avoided. It is also true that the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, carried out in the troubled areas of the world, have checked the escalation of armed conflicts and prevented their recurrence, and such action deserves high regard as a steady contribution towards securing peace in a quiet but constructive manner. These facts, more than anything else, clearly indicate that the role the United Nations has been playing for the maintenance of peace has been by no means insignificant. I wish to point out that it is important for the United Nations to continue and intensify such quiet but constructive activities in the future.\n20.\tSimilarly, I believe that the United Nations should play an analogous role in dealing with the question of international terrorism and matters related thereto. We are firmly opposed to any act of violence, whatever its reason may be, and we sincerely hope that the United Nations and other appropriate forums will take effective measures to put an end to these regrettable acts.\n21.\tOn the other hand, the role the United Nations is expected in play in the world today should not be confined to such a passive one as the prevention of the outbreak and spread of conflicts. In the past few years my country has repeatedly stressed in this Assembly hall the importance of the struggle for peace. What has been stressed by our delegation is indeed the attitude of positively winning peace; in other words, we believe that it is important for the United Nations to step up its endeavors to remove in advance the source of troubles which might cause the outbreak of conflicts, rather than limiting itself to playing the role of what may be called a fire brigade by seeking to suppress a conflict that has already erupted and prevent its expansion.\n22.\tWhat, then, can be done by the United Nations in such a positive pursuit of peace? In this respect, I wish to take up, first, the efforts for disarmament; second, the efforts for international economic and social development; and third, the efforts towards the strengthening of the United Nations itself in the organizational and financial fields, the basis which makes the first two efforts possible. It is on these three points that I intend to devote the rest of my statement in order to elaborate the position of my country.\n23.\tThe most serious problem which our world is facing today is that of the control and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons, which have sufficient destructive power to annihilate human beings. In this respect, it is most gratifying that efforts by nuclear-weapon States towards nuclear disarmament have at last shown a first sign of fruition. The two and a half years of negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union culminated in Moscow on 26 May 1972 in the concrete achievement of the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. This tangible fruit of the efforts of these two nuclear Powers towards disarmament deserves our high regard.\n24.\tHowever, to our regret, it is also the fact that a heated nuclear-armaments race is still continuing among the nuclear-weapon States. Particularly, it is most deplorable that such States, ignoring the strong objections of world public opinion, should be continuing and intensifying their nuclear tests. Although, as is well known, the question of banning nuclear-weapon tests had been the greatest issue in the post-war disarmament negotiations, no tangible result has been achieved in respect of a ban on the underground testing of nuclear weapons since 1963, when the so-called partial nuclear test-ban treaty  came into being to prohibit nuclear weapon tests in environments other than under-ground. Moreover, two nuclear-weapon States continue to refuse to become parties to this treaty, and have still been carrying out nuclear tests in the atmosphere despite protests registered by other countries apprehending the destruction of the human environment.\n25.\tI wish to express my ardent hope that the current session of the General Assembly will bend all its efforts to the early realization of a ban on nuclear tests by the nuclear-weapon States and to the prompt realization of concrete disarmament measures, particularly measures for nuclear disarmament, with the participation of all nuclear- weapon States in the disarmament negotiations.\n26.\tThe mutual interrelationships of States and peoples as they are developing and intensifying across national boundaries in such diverse spheres as economy, science and technology, social affairs, culture, and so forth, may be regarded as the basic feature of today's world. With all this diversification, it is inevitable that the world of today calls for greater solidarity on the part of the international community.\n27.\tThe United Nations is not an international organization which merely deals with political questions. This is the place where we debate and take action on all aspects of international life. As international relations are intensified and diversified, the importance of the role of the United Nations as a comprehensive international Organization aiming at the strengthening of the solidarity of the international community has greatly increased.\n28.\tIn particular, the United Nations has promptly applied itself to the task of wrestling with problems which are on the front line of today's world, such as the question of economic and social development, which is commonly known as \\\"the north and south problem\\\"; questions relating to the development and use of outer space and the sea-bed, which may be called \\\"man's last frontiers\\\"; the improvement and redevelopment of the human environment, and so forth. These efforts merit a high tribute, inasmuch as they open unlimited possibilities for the future of the United Nations.\n29.\tIt is from this viewpoint that I would like to take note of the significance of the two international conferences held in the first half of this year. One is the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTADJ, held last April and May in Santiago, the aim of which was the further promotion of the economic welfare of mankind; the other is the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held last June at Stockholm with a view to conserving the natural environment, which is indispensable to the existence of mankind. Nothing has so symbolically demonstrated the necessity for the unity and solidarity of mankind living on this one earth as these two international conferences held 10,000 miles apart in Santiago in the southern hemisphere, and in Stockholm in the northern hemisphere. These two conferences were clear evidence that the United Nations, embodying the aspirations of mankind, can play a most useful role in the emerging fields of the economic and social development of the world.\n30.\tThe sources of tension in the present world are often found in the existence of hunger and poverty. For many years, the United Nations has been endeavoring to resolve the problems of the economic gap between the developing and the developed countries, and the goals and objectives of its efforts are clearly stated in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].\n31.\tIn their efforts towards economic independence, the developing countries have faced a number of difficulties, and this has tended to give rise to the confrontation between the south and the north. In order to overcome such difficulties, it is indispensable that a close co-ordination should be maintained between the efforts of the developing countries and the assistance extended by the developed countries. In other words, this is a problem which should be approached in the context of the common responsibility of the international community and should be solved through mutual understanding between the developed and the developing countries and by the accumulation of agreements based on such understanding.\n32.\tMotivated by such considerations, my country, in co-operation with other participants, spared no effort to bring about a meeting of minds between the developed and the developing countries at the third session of UNCTAD. As a result of such efforts, agreements were reached on many issues, agreements based on the mutual understanding of each other's positions. I am convinced that the adoption of resolutions embodying these agreements was a significant achievement of the Conference.\n33.\tNaturally, the results of the Santiago conference should be appraised from a long-term point of view, inasmuch as the conference dealt with problems of historical significance. However, I should like to point out that one result of the Conference was of particular significance in giving orientation to the north-south question: that is, the recognition of the need for effective participation of the developing countries in the international monetary and trade systems. This basic concord was already implemented in part when the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related issues was established within the International Monetary Fund, and the multilateral trade negotiations beginning in 1973 are being prepared with the participation of developing countries.\n34.\tJapan will implement the measures to which it pledged itself at the third session of UNCTAD, including such measures as the attainment of the target of bringing its official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of its gross national product, the improvement of the terms and conditions of such assistance in particular by the promotion of untied assistance in general and the early and substantial improvement of the generalized scheme of preferences. My country is determined to co-operate positively in solving the many problems which the Santiago Conference left unsolved.\n35.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, aimed at the protection of what it called \\\"Only One Earth\\\" from the peril of destruction, was, in our view, one of the most successful and epoch-making conferences ever held by the United Nations. We attach particular importance to the dramatic achievement constituted by the success of the Conference in adopting its Declaration, in the deliberations on which the delegations of 113 countries took part, with all their different backgrounds of political, economic and social systems, traditions and value judgments.\n36.\tAmong the important principles contained in this Declaration we evaluate highly the very appropriate inclusion of principle 26, which states:\n\\\"Man and his environment must be spared the effects of\nnuclear weapons and all other means of mass destruction.\\\" \nThis principle was originally proposed and strongly pressed by the Japanese delegation.\n37.\tWith regard to the Environment Fund to be used for the implementation of a series of international action-plans for the preservation and improvement of the global human environment, it is the intention of my Government, as our representative stated at the Conference, to contribute up to 10 per cent of the target amount of the Fund. It is our hope that, through the appropriate operation of the Fund, all related activities of United Nations agencies and the efforts of every nation towards the protection and enhancement of the human environment will be effectively co-ordinated.\n38.\tI wish to stress that it is the common goal of all peoples, whether developed or developing, to preserve a better environment for the present and future generations. In order to attain this purpose continuous and strenuous efforts over a long period of time are needed. In this context, we fully endorsed at the Stockholm Conference the recommendation for convening a second United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.  We think it desirable that the details relating to this second Conference, including its time and place, should be fully examined in such appropriate bodies as the governing council for environmental programs, expected to be established at this session of the General Assembly, taking into account further developments which may take place in the future.\n\\\"9. I wish to refer now to another international conference to be organized by the United Nations that may equal in its significance the two United Nations conferences which I have just dwelt upon. It is the third conference on the law of the sea, scheduled to be held in 1973 with the objective of strengthening the international order with regard to the sea. Japan has consistently and positively participated in the deliberations of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction ever since it was established in 1967. The Japanese Government has particular concern and profound interest in the outcome of the conference on the law of the sea.\n40. My country sincerely hopes that that conference, after an elaborate and impartial study of all aspects of the peaceful uses of the ocean, will succeed in establishing a new global order which will benefit the whole community of nations and will harmonize in the fairest manner the interests of all the countries in the world. We shall make every effort to see that that hope is fully realized and shall maintain close contact with all the interested countries in the course of the preparations for the holding of the conference.\n41.\tTwenty-seven years have elapsed since the United Nations was founded, aspiring to permanent peace and the welfare of mankind. During this period the United Nations has had remarkable achievements in various fields of its activities. But has the United Nations fully lived up to the expectations held for it at the time of its foundation? One must admit that in this respect the general assessment is not always favorable. This is especially the case with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security, which is the primary objective of the United Nations.\n42.\tAs I stated in the earlier part of my remarks, the peace-keeping operations have certain weaknesses, owing to the lack of specific provisions in the Charter relating to them. I believe that the same can be said about the fact-finding functions of the United Nations.\n43.\tOf course, no organization can properly function without the will of those who run it. It may be true that many of the criticisms now directed against our Organization have arisen, not exclusively from the organizational or constitutional defects of the United Nations, but, in many instances, from the absence of the will on the part of Member States to observe the United Nations Charter. It is obviously important, therefore, that the Member States should reaffirm their determination to observe faithfully the Charter of the United Nations and prove their determination by their deeds.\n44.\tNevertheless, there is no gainsaying the fact that, with the passage of 27 years since the foundation of our Organization, there have appeared many discrepancies between the organization and functioning of the United Nations as originally envisaged by the Charter and the way it actually functions today When we think that these 27 years have seen the most drastic changes in the history of international relations, the emergence of such discrepancies could well be regarded as inevitable. But I believe that it is not for us to leave these discrepancies as they are without probing into them, if we have hope and confidence in the future of our Organization and a desire to see it strengthened.\n45.\tThe United Nations, which is the sole parliamentary organ of international society, can function in a truly effective manner as the focal point of international peace and co-operation only if we recognize fully the changes which have occurred in international society in the past quarter of a century and adjust ourselves to them with appropriate flexibility.\n46.\tI am convinced that it is high time for all Member States to put aside all past differences and to study with an open mind ways and means for strengthening the organization and functioning of the United Nations. I earnestly hope that constructive steps forward in this direction will be taken during the present session of the General Assembly.\n47.\tIt is of utmost importance that the United Nations should be provided with a sound and solid financial basis if it is to fulfill its expected role. I should like to invite attention to the deplorable situation in which the United Nations finds itself, prevented from performing its effective and efficient activities because of ever-accumulating deficits. For any organization, sound and rational financing is a prerequisite to its viability. And without such financing, no organization would be able to conduct a long-term and effective operation. I do believe that now is the time for Member States to join forces to solve the problem. Japan considers that those Member States which are directly connected to the cause of the present financial crisis of the United Nations should adopt constructive attitudes conducive to a solution of the problem. However, in view of the fact that this is an important question confronting all Member States, Japan wishes to render its co-operation from a practical standpoint.\n48.\tFurthermore, as the United Nations expands its fields of activities every year, it has become all the more important to secure and use effectively the funds necessary for such activities. I believe it is imperative for the Member States to take a keener interest and give positive co-operation on this question of securing the funds for United Nations activities. Lately, Japan's financial contributions to the United Nations have been increasing at a very fast pace. This reflects the great expectations and ardent support of our people for the United Nations and its activities. It is the intention of my country to continue to increase its contribution in this field as far as its national capacity permits.\n49.\tTwenty-seven years ago, mankind placed in this Organization boundless hope for the achievement of permanent peace and the promotion of the welfare of mankind.\n50.\tDeeply conscious that there is no other international peace machinery to replace the United Nations, and recalling the spirit which inspired the United Nations at the time of its foundation, I believe we should make as large an effort as possible to foster and strengthen this Organization.\n51.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization for the year 1971-1972, the Secretary-General stated:\n\\\"The Member States alone can develop the potential of the Organization by using it and obeying its rules, by holding to the long-term objectives of the Charter in spite of short-term disappointments and frustrations, and by accepting the imperfections and shortcomings of the United Nations not as a mark of failure, but as part of the inevitable process of growth which any institution must pass through in its early stages of development.\\\" [A/ 8701/Add. 1, p.2.J\nI fully share the Secretary-General's view.\n52.\tWhile frankly admitting the shortcomings and limitations of the United Nations, Japan is fully aware of the importance of the role it is playing in today's world and is determined to do its utmost for the consolidation and advancement of that role. In this regard, I was very much impressed by the remarks made the day before yesterday by Mr. Rogers, Secretary of State of the United States, on the role to be played by Japan [2038th meeting, para. 64].\n53.\tI sincerely hope that this session of the General Assembly, recognizing the fact that the future of the United Nations depends entirely on the determination of its Member States, will succeed in achieving meaningful results in international co-operation and in the constructive and just settlement of the various questions now before us.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my delegation joins with those delegations that have preceded us on this rostrum in conveying to you our warmest congratulations on your brilliant election to preside over the work of this twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly. We do this with all the more pleasure and happiness since you come from Poland, a country with which Rwanda maintains very friendly relations.\n2.\tI should also like to express once again the great appreciation of my delegation to the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, for the impartiality and the great sense of diplomacy with which he guided the work of the twenty- sixth session.\n3.\tMoreover, this Assembly is entitled to a special word of gratitude from my delegation since it has elected our country to one of the posts of Vice-President. Rwanda is highly honored at this special mark of confidence, and, consistent with its traditions, commits itself to make its total contribution to the complete success of the work of this session.\n4.\tIn all of its foreign policy Rwanda is guided by the principles of the Charter of our Organization and by the need for co-operation among nations to safeguard peace, to create security for all, and to promote the best living conditions for the popular masses of all countries.\n5.\tAt the time of my country's admission to this Organization, 10 years ago, our Head of State, Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda, the father of our country, said the following:\n\\\"The Rwandese Republic will be found in the ranks of those who have already worked so hard for true decolonization, which leads to better conditions for development and progress. We stand beside those who are striving for an equitable distribution of the benefits deriving from progress, in the various forms of technical and financial\nassistance. We stand beside those who seek the abolition of methods based on discrimination and violence. We stand beside those who who are endeavoring to create or strengthen, realistically, joint organs for co-operation among nations. We stand beside all those who seek every peaceful means of guaranteeing and promoting the fullest exercise of fundamental freedoms. [1122nd meeting, para. 103. ]\n6.\tThat commitment expressed 10 years ago still reverberates in the hearts of the Rwandese people, and there could be no more resounding echo of this solemn act of faith than the following wise words pronounced, again by our Head of State, on the occasion of the New Year's celebration of 1972:\n\\\"We hope that collaboration between countries will increasingly take as its basis brotherhood among men and that this approach will facilitate any negotiations that may become necessary. We hope that in all countries the various efforts to promote development will be faithfully co-ordinated and that they will be crowned with success for all of our peoples. We would like to see diplomatic and technical missions all over the world make a real contribution to true understanding between groups and countries and to a more equitable distribution of labor and goods.\\\"\n7.\tBoth at home and abroad Rwanda, therefore, is working for peace and the happiness of peoples, inspired by the principles set forth earlier in this statement.\n8.\tAt home, thanks to the dynamism displayed by its people, which has withstood all tests, Rwanda, through the popular revolution of 1959, has been able to throw off the feudal ties formed by the Tutsi ethnic group, which was deeply anchored in its barbarous customs and traditions and which, through maneuvers and intrigues of all kinds, mercilessly exploited the Hutu ethnic group, although that group represented the overwhelming majority, 90 per cent, of the population of the country. The popular masses of Rwanda, after having thrown off these tyrants, now enjoy true peace and real public tranquility which are founded on a social harmony that rules out any inequality based on ethnic or other considerations. It is all the more painful for us to see in a neighboring country that a feudal minority has set forth its own program to exterminate a majority, founding its decisions solely on racial considerations which have been condemned by history. We publicly condemn this systematic genocide directed against the majority ethnic group as strongly as we have never ceased to condemn the inhuman policy of racial segregation in South Africa and that of the so-called Government of Southern Rhodesia, as well as the colonialism which Portugal imposes \non the African populations in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).\n9.\tRwanda expresses once again its concern over the attitude of the Government of South Africa, which continues to ignore the various United Nations resolutions adopted to help the peoples under the domination of the Pretoria regime. We hope that this session will decree effective measures designed to set up everywhere a regime of freedom and human dignity.\n10.\tThe Rhodesian problem is equally a matter of concern because of its ramifications. Thanks to the complicity of the economic and financial interests of the great Western Powers in particular, the black people of Southern Rhodesia are denied their rights to human dignity and self- determination. I continue to believe that the British Government remains fully responsible for the state of affairs which prevails in Southern Rhodesia.\n11.\tIt is in the light of the principles enshrined in the Charter that my Government has never ceased to condemn the policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of Pretoria, as well as the racist policy exercised by a white minority over the black population of Rhodesia. In speaking out against this policy, we are at the same time condemning all foreign Powers which wish to convert the southern part of Africa into a land where the white man would rule over the colored people.\n12.\tWe unreservedly support the national liberation movements which are clamoring for genuine national independence.\n13.\tWhen we consider the means to be used to achieve this goal, we think that, in addition to armed struggle, we should not lose sight of peaceful means capable of leading to the same goal. In this connexion, our Head of State, His Excellency Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda, expressed himself clearly in these terms, so fraught with wisdom, on the occasion of the New Year's celebration in 1972:\n\\\"We would like to see decolonization advance on valid foundations and without the violence we have sometimes had occasion to witness. And here we should be quite clear that, whether it be the stubborn attitude of Portugal or the present leaders of South Africa or those in Southern Rhodesia, whether it be the liberation fighters all too comfortably installed outside their country all of this is violence in contradiction to the goodness which triggers the movement of history if it is spearheaded by men of clear vision and honesty. We believe that patient negotiations-adroit, if need be, but energetic and loyal- aided by all of us, will overcome the stubborn colonialists.\\\"\n14.\tWhile southern Africa is thus suffering from this scourge of apartheid and colonialism, certain parts of Asia are equally afflicted by senseless wars in which the victims are counted in the thousands.\n15.\tThe Viet-Nam war has obviously lasted too long. My Government cannot take any sides in this question which, in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter, should be settled by honest negotiations and not by weapons. We retain the firm hope that the Paris negotiations on Viet-Nam will soon find an end to the present impasse and lead to a solution mutually acceptable to the two parties to the dispute.\n16.\tIt would be useful for the diplomats who are conducting the Paris negotiations on Viet-Nam to be guided by the words uttered by our Head of State on 19 December 1971 at the opening of the meeting of foreign diplomats accredited to Rwanda:\n\\\"Our method, to sum up, is frank negotiation. The Ambassador of Rwanda is prohibited from losing time in old methods which sidestep the main issues, with interminable gestures of protocol; neither can he use the condemned methods of launching trial balloons to see the reaction or to foster misunderstandings between negotiators; he must go straight to the point, pinpoint responsibilities, explain clearly the point of view of his Government in bringing out and presenting the conclusion that he is sustaining. He should agree to discussion, always provided that it is direct and frank, accepting the concessions that are possible and likely to lead to an effective common agreement. Accordingly, lies, various subterfuges, distortions and all forms of dishonesty are forbidden to him and the preference is given to clear, direct negotiation, as is proper between sincere brothers.\\\"\n17.\tNow, what of the problem of the Middle East? This, too, is a subject of great concern to my Government. The imperative need for peace and security in that region of the world also requires that the two parties to the dispute, Israel and the Arab States, should accept negotiation as the only valid and equitable means of ending this painful dispute which has cast so many families into mourning and left so many orphans. For my country, the solution of the problem is to be found in the total application of resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council.\n18.\tI should like to touch on another, equally thorny question, that of divided Korea. In this connexion, Rwanda firmly encourages the current talks between the two parties to find ways and means of reuniting the families divided as a result of the setting up of the demarcation line between the two Koreas. It is the duty of this international Organization to support such initiatives undertaken by the Koreans themselves to settle their own problem, rather than becoming involved, since the parties concerned can settle the matter in a more realistic fashion. The essential is that this should be a loyal and peaceful effort.\n19.\tThus, Rwanda, just as it condemns apartheid which rages in South Africa, has equally no fear in denouncing racism wherever it is practiced, even if it is exercised by blacks over other blacks, as is being done in that country of black Africa where an ethnic minority is in the process of exterminating, in the name of racism, another ethnic group which is none the less in the majority. Whether we are talking about the Middle East or Burundi, Rwanda hopes that this problem will be solved by means of negotiation. Whether we are dealing with Korea or Germany, Rwanda would like to see the reunification of these countries by peaceful means, with frank and definite proposals for collaboration put forward.\n20.\tI would like to raise another problem here which has a particular aspect: that of good relations of States with their neighbors. In this connexion I should like once again to dispel any misunderstandings that may have emerged concerning the policy of Rwanda on this score, and particularly with respect to its neighbor to the north, Uganda.\n21.\tCertain foreign radio broadcasts have echoed rumors tending to present Rwanda as helping certain armed groups which are ready to attack Uganda. These rumors are completely devoid of foundation; they are only a false maneuver prepared by impenitent feudal groups and orchestrated by the enemies of Africa to sabotage the friendly relations existing between the Republic of Rwanda and Uganda. My country categorically denies those false reports and wishes to make clear that it does not shelter on its territory any armed foreign corps preparing an attack against its neighbors. Certain radio broadcasts have mentioned Israeli mercenaries. My Government would like to deny these rumors. As far as Israelis are concerned, in my country there are only the diplomatic personnel of the Embassy that has been installed at Kigali since 1964.\n22.\tFor its part, my Government, anxious to ensure this policy of good neighborliness, abides by the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries. Therefore, neighboring countries, and in particular Uganda, have absolutely nothing to fear from my Government. It would, however, be desirable if our international jurists could succeed in defining for us more clearly what are the domestic affairs of another country, so as not to encourage indifference by some parties to situations which violate the right to life of all human beings. The case of Burundi, where more than 200,000 innocent victims have just been massacred, and the cases of the Middle East and of South Africa would serve as examples to be used in such a study.\n23.\tIn no circumstances and at no price could Rwanda allow its country to be used as a haven for outlaws or mercenaries of any kind. The firm attitude that my country took in 1967 vis-a-vis the mercenaries expelled from Zaire and then from Rwanda, where they had taken asylum, is known to all. As far as we are concerned, respect for the principle of good neighborliness is a sacred tenet.\n24.\tI turn now to the problem of disarmament. We all know that every year States, and particularly the great Powers, allocate vast sums further to perfect their armaments. But we also know that these funds could be better used if they were devoted to promote development. Every year more than $200,000 million and a great many scientists are diverted from genuinely positive purposes to destructive ends. Rwanda is, however, gratified at the efforts which our Organization has unceasingly made, perhaps slowly, but surely, to avert this danger, which is pushing mankind towards its own suicide through the manufacture and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. In this connexion, we should refer to the various resolutions and treaties which have been adopted within the framework of the United Nations concerning various aspects of disarmament .\n25.\tIn this connexion we should recall resolution 41 (I) of 14 December 1946 concerning measures designed to reduce armaments and eliminate atomic weapons; resolution 1378 (XIV) of 20 November 1959 concerning general and complete disarmament; the Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water of 1963; resolution 2030 (XX) of 29 November 1965 concerning the convening of a world disarmament conference; the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]; resolution 2602 E (XXIV) of 16 December 1969 which proclaimed the Disarmament Decade beginning in 1970; resolution 2661 A (XXV) of 7 December 1970, urgently calling upon the Governments which are nuclear Powers immediately to put an end to the nuclear arms race, to cease all testing and to refrain from setting up offensive and defensive nuclear weapons systems; resolution 2660 (XXV) of 7 December 1970 containing the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof, as well as the signature of the aforementioned Treaty on 11 February 1971; resolution 2826 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971 containing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and toxin weapons and on their Destruction, open to the signature of States since 10 April 1972; the signing at Moscow by the Soviet Union and United States of America, during the month of May 1972, of an Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.\n26.\tAll States of the world should support all of these efforts which are designed to bring about general and complete disarmament, for the responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security is not the monopoly of certain States, but the duty of all.\n27.\tI must, however, repeat the words of my President, Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda:\n\\\"We must not confuse disarmament with the regimentation of science. For scientific research must continue for the progress of mankind. We should only avoid utilizing the results of this research for war or for other negative purposes\\\"\n28.\tWe would rather reaffirm the fact that the reduction and later the elimination of expenditure for armaments would be beneficial for the development of the less favored countries, if all States, particularly those which are wealthy, would wish to embark decisively upon a course of genuine international co-operation, one of the overriding imperatives of our time. And as was stated by Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda, our eminent Chief of State:\n\\\"To make peace is also to disarm. The Government of Rwanda does not consider the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction as the only threat to peace. To disarm is to convert the expenditures on armaments and military equipment into instruments in the struggle against under-development.\\\"\n29.\tThus, the vast amounts of money, material resources and human energy spent for armaments should be used for the liberation of the three quarters of mankind who suffer from hunger, ignorance and disease. This is the place to reaffirm that the wealthier countries will make no progress without risk, except to the extent that they support the great struggle which is being waged by the less favored countries against under-development.\n30.\tThe delegation of Rwanda has never ceased to express its increasing concern at the fact that the development of the younger nations is paralyzed partly by the decline in world prices for commodities and, on the other hand, by the parallel increase in the price of manufactured goods.\n31.\tOn the question of world prices for primary commodities, when the relevant agreements on commodities are concluded, Rwanda would like to see the less advanced countries get special attention and benefit from preferential treatment, such as the broadening and, in some cases, the elimination of quotas which limit their export ceilings, and we would like these countries to be exempted from making contributions for the purpose of financing buffer stocks.\n32.\tIn the case of the manufactured and semi-manufactured goods exported by the less advanced countries to the developed countries, these products should be traded free of all duties and taxes. The developed countries have no reason to be hostile to such an arrangement, in as much as the quantity of the products involved is very limited.\n33.\tWith respect to the fundamental problem of the actual financing of development, the delegation of Rwanda would like to reaffirm the position that it defended in the course of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], which was just held this year, a position which is explained in a few clear propositions, as follows.\n34.\tFirst, a special allocation of special drawing rights should be urgently granted to those countries which, as a result of the devaluation of the dollar, have suffered considerable losses in their export receipts.\n35.\tSecondly, we should reverse the current flow of international aid which continues to be allocated to the more advanced of the recipient countries so that it would go first to those that need it most, that is to say, to the least developed of the under-developed countries.\n36.\tThirdly, bilateral and international assistance should do away with the various counterpart funds habitually demanded from the less advanced countries when financial agreements for development projects or technical assistance and personnel projects are concluded.\n37.\tFourthly, we should fight against the principle of aid with conditions attached which deprive the recipient countries of the power of decision over priorities or other ways of using such aid.\n38.\tWith respect to the problem of land-locked countries, among which I include my own, we should repeat our great satisfaction that the lack of a coastline the fact that a country is land-locked is accepted as one of the criteria which are used to define the concept of a \\\"less advanced country\\\" among the developing countries. Moreover, we should like to renew the appeal that our delegation made last year from this rostrum to the effect that countries which have not done so yet should without further delay give their support to the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-locked States, signed at New York on 8 July 1965. Moreover, it would not be out of order to call upon countries through which the goods of land-locked countries pass in transit to grant the latter all transit facilities, such as the elimination of bonds and other transit duties and the creation of free zones. We should also hope that shipping rates would be fixed and maintained at a reasonable level.\n39.\tI have already spoken of the fundamental problem of financing development. We can never stress this point sufficiently. As is known, in most of the developing countries the fulfillment of the national development plan depends in large measure on bilateral or multilateral foreign aid.\n40.\tMoreover, let us note that when we break down the structure of this foreign aid, both bilateral and multilateral, we see that the largest portion, approximately 61 per cent, is expended for foreign technical assistance personnel in wages, housing, transport and exorbitant privileges.\n41.\tIt is probably true that the developing countries generally do not yet have an adequate number of the technicians needed to provide the leadership required for the development of their countries. But this is no reason to justify the fact that the industrialized and developed countries send them inexperienced technicians or people with less training, sometimes, than a number of persons available locally. Now, as it happens, very often, the granting of funds is tied to the acceptance of technicians from the donor country, and here we find ourselves again in a vicious circle, since it is these same technicians who receive the largest piece of the cake in the allocation of aid to the various sectors. This is the neo-colonialism that everyone denounces.\n42.\tMy delegation believes that successful co-operation in respect of technical assistance staff depends in particular on the proper training of technical assistants who adequately fit the job description, the assignment of the technician to his post until his mission has been completed and the positive desire of the foreign technician to communicate to his opposite number the professional knowledge that he has, so that the latter can really replace him properly.\n43.\tIn concluding my statement I should like in public to pay a tribute to the various organs of the United Nations, to Member and non-member States which, in one fashion or another, have contributed or are contributing to the economic and social advancement of my country. In so doing they have correctly understood the duty of solidarity which binds all peoples together and which is the guarantee of peace and world balance.\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. The historical ties between my country and Poland add to my satisfaction at seeing you presiding over this Assembly. We feel sure that your high qualities and wide experience will be a valuable asset to the success of our deliberations.\n45.\tI wish also to express our appreciation and gratitude to our former President, Mr. Adam Malik, for the excellent job he did throughout his tenure of office. I am sure that this great Assembly will continue to benefit from his wisdom and experience.\n46.\tThis is the first occasion I have had to address the General Assembly since the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt WaMheim, assumed his high office. I have had the privilege of co-operating with him for many long years and I should like to convey my sincere appreciation of his outstanding performance of his task, which is dedicated to peace and to the attainment of the ideals of the United Nations. I wish him all success in his future endeavors.\n47.\tI should like also to welcome Under Secretary-General Morse and to wish him well in his new duties.\n48.\tOur agenda is weighted as usual with items of crucial importance. Our world continues to be troubled by many centers of strife, conflict, instability and unhappiness. Many dangerous problems await speedy and just solutions. On the other hand, some recent developments lead us to believe that, for the first time since the end of the Second World War, we may well be on the threshold of a qualitatively different era of international relations. So before I elaborate on the prospects we can hope for, permit me to dwell briefly upon some of the major problems which confront us.\n49.\tAlthough so many years have elapsed since the cease-fire in the Middle East, we note regretfully that the settlement which would end the plight of the peoples of this region is still to come. We maintain the view that Security Council resolution 242(1967) contains all the necessary elements for bringing about a just and durable solution of this problem. Having consistently supported Ambassador Jarring's mission, we observe with satisfaction the realistic and constructive attitude taken in this respect by some of the directly interested Arab States. We believe that this approach should not only be put to good use but should also be followed by the other parties to the conflict.\n50.\tThe establishment of a just and durable peace should naturally safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned. But we feel that such a peace cannot be founded on the acquisition of political or territorial advantages through the use or threat of force. We have always insisted that the status of Jerusalem, a holy city for three major religions of mankind, should not be changed by unilateral action.\n51.\tAs regards developments in the subcontinent, we think that the favorable atmosphere created at the Simla meeting between the leaders of Pakistan and India should be utilized for further agreements. The speedy restoration of peaceful conditions, stability and co-operation in the region will undoubtedly be in the interest of all concerned.\n52.\tIn this respect I should like to emphasize particularly the fact that the predicament of prisoners of war constitutes a great cause for concern. We believe that for political, legal and especially humanitarian considerations these prisoners of war should be repatriated as soon as possible, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and with due regard to the United Nations resolutions.\n53.\tThe abhorrence with which Turkey views colonialism and racial discrimination is too well known to need stressing. Suffice it to say that my country was one of the sponsors of the historic Declaration on decolonization, and occupies for the third time the office of President of the United Nations Cou, oil for Namibia.\n54.\tToday 28 million people still live under colonial rule. The worst cases of this anachronism continue to prevail in parts of the African continent, where no substantial improvement has been recorded in the past year. The only exception to this tragic situation is the chain of rather hopeful developments in connexion with Namibia, such as the visit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations from 6 to 10 March 1972 and the appointment of his representative, on the recommendation of the Security Council in its resolution 319 (1972).\n55.\tTurkey, which takes a great interest in the questions of Africa in general and in the problems of decolonization in particular, was pleased to receive this year the members of the United Nations Council for Namibia, as well as a delegation representing the OAU under the chairmanship of Mr. Moktar Ould Daddah, the President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. The exchange of views in Ankara served to illustrate once again the understanding which so happily exists between Turkey and the African countries.\n56.\tThe world community today is being wantonly and needlessly torn apart by a new form of violence. I refer to acts of international terrorism ranging from the hijacking of aircraft to the kidnapping and killing of innocent people. The frequency with which these events have been taking place in recent times and the tragic consequences they have brought about have created a general feeling of insecurity in the daily conditions of normal life and have proved that national actions to prevent them must be complemented by measures at the international level. Turkey favors all positive and sensible initiatives in this direction. However, in coping with this urgent problem and in order to be just and effective all care should be taken to ensure that acts of terrorism per se do not become the object of political exploitation one way or another. International political issues and criminal acts should be kept in their respective domains and dealt with accordingly.\n57.\tWe agree with our Secretary-General when he says that the underlying situations which give rise to violence and terrorism should be considered simultaneously. While on this subject I should like to point out the emergence of a new kind of subversive terrorism directed from abroad and aimed at undermining the national independence, unity and territorial integrity of States. Yet we all know that under the Charter of our Organization each State has the right to choose freely its economic, social and political system and we cherish this freedom to determine our national affairs. It is all the more regrettable that the acts to which I refer are directed against countries which follow a policy of peace, entente and co-operation, abide faithfully by the Charter of the United Nations and practice tolerance and good will in their international relations. If we are sincere, as we should be, in our desire to strengthen international peace and security, to promote co-operation and concord and to develop further the climate of detente, the international community should not remain indifferent to those subversive acts, which are flagrant and dangerous violations of the Charter and the decisions of the General Assembly. It has never be forgotten that sincerity and good faith should not be just empty words but should always be truly respected in civilized intercourse among nations and that resort to double standards ultimately leads to chaos. \n58.\tMay I now turn to some of those hopeful developments which at least indicate that the international firmament is not entirely clouded. It is a source of satisfaction for us to see two great nations of the Asian continent, China and Japan, bridging the differences and inaugurating a new era in their relations. South and North Korea have initiated negotiations for peaceful unification. We earnestly hope that their efforts will be crowned with success. On the other hand, we welcome the talks which are going on between East and West Germany. We see in them a further contribution to the process of detente and expect that they will yield positive results in the near future. In the field of disarmament the SALT agreement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  constitutes a landmark. We are also on the eve of a conference which is to take up the disarmament question on a global basis. We believe that, in the preliminary work of preparation for this conference, not only the great military Powers but also States belonging to different regions and having special strategic positions should participate. Considering that such a conference may be a turning-point in human history, in mankind's age-old dream of peace, Turkey nourishes very high hopes for it and attaches great importance to its being held after the completion of all preparations necessary for its success.\n59.\tAnother forthcoming event of major importance for peace is the prospective conference on European security and co-operation. Turkey's attitude towards this conference is similar to its attitude towards the conference on disarmament. That is to say, Turkey welcomes it wholeheartedly; places great hopes in it; wishes to see it completely successful; and for that very reason wants full preparation.\n60.\tAs was stated by my delegation from this rostrum last year [1954th meetingJ, political agreements alone cannot meet all the requirements of security. They need to be complemented by a lowering of the level of the military forces which confront each other. It is this necessity that has bred the concept of mutual and balanced force reductions. As durable peace can only come about through real security, I would like to stress once again the undeniable and inescapable link between the military and political aspects of the forthcoming conference.\n61.\tNow I wish to say a few words on the question of Cyprus, which is of direct interest to my country. It is known that on the basis of the suggestion of the Secretary- General, the inter-communal talks in Cyprus have been resumed in an enlarged form.  Turkey has always been in favor of finding a peaceful and permanent solution for the Cyprus question based on' the partnership of the two communities in the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the island, and in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the Turkish and Greek communities and the other parties concerned. It is in that hope that Turkey has accepted the proposition of the Secretary-General for the reactivation of the talks in their new form. All we wish now is that these talks arrive at a successful conclusion. In speaking about Cyprus, I take the opportunity to reiterate the deep appreciation of my\nGovernment to all those who contribute to the peacekeeping effort in the island.\n62.\tUp to now, I have touched upon some important problems occupying the international scene. I have tried to draw f-s impartial a picture possible. But if I have cited both negative and positive factors with almost equal weight, this is not merely out of a concern for objectivity. The present situation in our world is indeed an extremely complex one, made up of quite contradictory elements. Yet, essentially, we seem to be facing two diverging paths, one leading to disaster and the other to hope. The only similarity which can be found in these two alternatives is that they are both of a cosmic dimension.\n63.\tAlthough the problems of our times have roots which go deep into our past, it is nevertheless an inescapable fact that the onus of coping with them belongs to our generation. All our thinkers, leaders, statesmen, all our public figures with influence and authority, even all the rank-and-file people whose preferences and rejections make up popular opinion-in a word, all of us-are responsible for making the ultimate choice between the path of despair and the path of happiness. That is our historic task which, while it is tremendously difficult, ought to be considered also as a source of pride by all people of goodwill and dedication to the betterment of the human lot.\n64.\tHow, then, to make this vital choice between bifurcating paths? How to strive for peace, prosperity and happiness, avoiding all pitfalls which may well be dangerous enough to prove fatal for the entire human race? To answer those questions, we must have a general look at the fundamental aspirations of man, as well as at the successes and failures he has encountered in his endeavors. We can thus hope to trace some of the causes which lie behind his checkered record, and to think of ways and means which, seemingly modest at the outset, can eventually grow successfully if adopted in goodwill and used with patience.\n65.\tWith the hindsight provided by a long history, and with the increased awareness caused by the exacerbation of the problems, mainly because of the discrepancy between the great technical advance, on the one hand, and the relative lack of success in the conduct of international affairs, on the other, the attainment of man's aspirations is not only more urgent but also more evident today than ever. Man aspires to peace. He seeks it more sincerely and more fervently than he ever sought the glory of the battlefields. He seeks real security, the kind of security which is both the prerequisite and the fruit of peace. He knows that neither freedom nor co-operation can flourish in a climate of strife. He is now at last aware that he is his brother's keeper and he must indeed love his neighbor.\n66.\tMan aspires to prosperity. He realizes that his most basic needs will risk going unsatisfied unless his labor is put to full profit through general, even world-wide, co-operation. He hopes to find in this co-operation a means of achieving a fairer pattern of distribution of the wealth produced among nations. He understands the importance of a sound social order, just as he sees the role that economic development plays in shaping it.\n67.\tAnd, lastly, man aspires to a more hospitable environment to live in. He begins to heed the solemn warning of nature. He grasps the grim fact that world resources are neither inexhaustible nor proof against deadly deterioration, in fact, there is no denying that this planet of ours can, through our carelessness, become an almost unsuitable place for human survival. On the other hand, if not subjected to wanton destruction, it can at the same time preserve its pristine beauties and adorn itself by man-made wonders. Technological advances, which ought to be a source of well-being and happiness, will be a threat to our very existence if not achieved with a sense of responsibility.\n68.\tThose being mankind's most outstanding goals, how far has he advanced towards them up to now? To belittle the distance covered in the course of long centuries of civilization would be tantamount to disparaging the creative ability of the human mind. Man's achievements are indeed impressive. But are they, in their actual shape, capable of satisfying his ever-growing needs? We have already stated that man's past record in this connexion has been an uneven one, marked by failures as well as by successes. The problems confronting us today, such as overpopulation, food shortages, lack of adequate education and health facilities, our near helplessness in the face of natural calamities, and the absence of an atmosphere of trust and security, bear witness to these failures.\n69.\tHowever, it seems to us that through our failures and successes we have accomplished one important task: we have aroused a common consciousness among all the peoples of the problems which beset us. We believe the time is ripe now to make use of this common consciousness, and the best instrument we have for this purpose is the United Nations.\n70.\tOne feature of international relations is the process of detente. We welcome this development as it increases our hopes for a durable peace. However, up to the present, detente has been far from reaching a completely satisfactory level, both in scope and in solidity.\n71.\tIn spite of the inauguration of an atmosphere of detente we are still experiencing strife, conflict and hostility. A genuine detente on a global scale is bound to be an unfulfilled wish of the peoples of the world as long as this state of affairs remains unchanged. Conditions obtaining in international relations being what they are, it will of course be, to say the least, unrealistic to hope for an immediate elimination of political conflicts. They are too deep-rooted to be conjured away immediately or easily.\n72.\tBut does this mean that we are utterly powerless to do anything whatsoever in this domain here and now? If, as I said, we are unable to do away speedily with the conflicts themselves, is it not within our power to check the crises they engender? Can we not find some means to take away their acuteness? Would it be too much to contemplate a kind of freeze for some types of political conflicts for limited periods of time? Recalling the United Nations noteworthy accomplishments through the declaration of the Decades in the fields of disarmament as well as of economic development, would it not be within the grasp of this Assembly to declare, for example, a '\\\"decade of political conciliation\\\" and devise the means of promoting it? Could we not systematize and concert all individual and collective past efforts within this Organization to such a noble task? Could we not translate such a spirit of conciliation into a system of effective co-ordination of all the various political, economic and social efforts?\n73.\tSuch an approach to some types of international conflicts would not only enable us to benefit from the healing effects of time but would also enable our Organization through the systematization of its efforts to speed up their settlement.\n74.\tIn saying this, I am not making any formal proposal but rather submitting these views for meditation and consideration.\n75.\tI must also emphasize that my remarks have no bearing on conflicts resulting from colonialism and the forceful occupation of foreign territories. We cannot expect either a subjected people or freedom-loving countries to tolerate colonial rule for any length of time. Neither can we tolerate violations of fundamental human rights in contravention of solemnly undertaken international agreements. The same applies to the case of lands wrenched away by brutal force.\n76.\tProblems created by such causes demand not only our Organization's urgent and undivided attention, but also its uncompromising action.\n77.\tTo conclude, I should like to underline one outstanding feature that seems to characterize our times, namely, that man's inner revolution, his expectations, in short, man's consciousness has now reached a level of development that clearly outstrips what his political, social aid economic environment can provide for him. There is a new individual consciousness whether a man be rich or poor, strong or weak, developed or undeveloped the quality and magnitude of which have been unparalleled in any previous era of human history.\n78.\tThis unbalanced relationship between man and his total environment carries the seeds of both promise and calamity for our future. When countries all over the world are striving through indMdual efforts or, as in the case of regional and global organizations, through collective efforts to meet the challenge of our age, the problems of the political environment cannot be abandoned to haphazard and non-systematized solutions, in isolation from the social and economic environment of man. At a time of common destiny for all nations, problems facing man must be boldly taken up in their totality, for if they are not, we may suffer the loss of man's accomplishments. That is why I felt compelled to call upon this august Assembly to ponder deeply in respect of the political problems singled out, the choice we now face between hope and disaster, between promise and despair, between consolation and conflict. The implication is clear. There is no place for a mentality of status quo in the archaic sense. It is a change towards the satisfaction of human aspirations that is needed, but must this change be disorderly, destructive, disruptive and even deadly or, in our efforts for a better world to live in, can we not act intelligently and with a sense of responsibility and with imagination?\n79.\tI believe it is through this attentive, wise and patient action of the United Nations that we can best hope to see great Atatiirk's life-long dream of \\\"peace at home and peace in the world\\\"' come true for the benefit of all mankind.\n80.\tI wish all success for the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me first to extend to you my heartiest congratulations on behalf of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic on your accession to your high office as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This honor to you and your great country is a recognition of the long years of struggle against nazism and racism and is a further expression of the role your country and people have played in the affairs of mankind.\n167.\tAllow me, Mr. President, to express our deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Malik, for guiding success-fully and with distinction the affairs of the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly. The peoples of Asia are proud that its great men have repeatedly contributed to the service of the peoples of the United Nations.\n168.\tI should like also to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, who is participating in our meeting in his present capacity for the first time. The office of Secretary-General has always been an example to be followed in impartiality and neutrality and in the devotion of man to the affairs of his fellow men.\n165. More than a quarter of a century has passed since the adoption of the United Nations Charter. A quick comparison of the hopes and aspirations it contains with the present world situation clearly indicates the vast differences between the beauty of dreams and the pain and bitterness of realities. The Charter states: \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\", while the world of today declares: \\\"We the States of the United Nations\\\". The world of today is governed by \\\"We the States of the United Nations\\\" where maneuvers, compromises and pressures find an open avenue for the achievement of purely selfish gains, never in the interest of the peoples of the United Nations. Those who were responsible for the formulation of the Charter committed themselves \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold suffering to mankind\\\". Yet some of the States have more than once, and at times under the flag of the United Nations itself, inflicted on the present and consequently future generations the scourges of war, racism and suppression. The result of this policy has been a perpetual state of sorrow and grief. Not only have innocent lives been lost and fundamental freedoms jeopardized, but also the prestige of the United Nations has been tarnished and the fundamental moral values embodied in its Charter negated.\n170.\tThe world of today leads us to believe that the expectations of those who formulated the Charter were neither realistic nor based on a true vision of the future of man for they envisioned a human society in which tolerance would be practiced and in which we should live in peace with one another as good neighbors. Unfortunately, we do not see in the bombardment of civilians with the instruments of destruction and annihilation any indication of tolerance or an incentive to live in peace.\n171.\tThe United Nations started its life by blessing the plantation of a racialist, Nazi gang in Palestine-the land of tolerance, love and peace thereby forcing its indigenous population to live in a permanent state of terror, fear and anxiety. The United Nations has also seated in our midst the representatives of this gang, who fill its halls with threats and sacrilege, while the voice of a people among the peoples of the United Nations is choked with terror and fear. In spite of this, the Charter is still viewed by some as a foundation for peace, prosperity and security.\n172.\tMere respect for the human values embodied in the Charter makes some Member States feel ashamed to refer to it while in word and deed they practice the distortion of facts, truth and honesty. The Charter stressed that we should unite our strength with the peoples of the world in order to maintain international peace and security; but today, after a quarter of a century of endless Zionist crimes, we the States of the world allow the Zionist gang to pursue its aggressive acts against the peoples of the United Nations. We are called upon to stand idle, to allow the Charter to be violated and even to condone this Organization's failure to adopt a resolution calling for a cease-fire, thanks to the United States veto.\n173.\tSome of the practices committed during the lifetime of the United Nations make its founders feel that their expectations were unattainable. The United Nations, as envisioned by the Charter, would be a center for the harmonization and co-ordination of action by all nations to obtain those lofty goals. Nevertheless, we find that unilateral and bilateral actions by the big Powers have taken this Organization completely out of any realm of coordination of international affairs. It has become the rule, and not the exception, for issues to be settled and agreements concluded among the big Powers, the peoples of the United Nations being the very last to know. Let me hasten to state that, while we are proud to be among the peoples of the United Nations, we are in favor of any rapprochement that will strengthen international peace and security. However, we doubt that secret and bilateral agreements take into consideration the interests of the small States and peoples outside the sphere of the big Powers.\n174.\tLet me emphasize that the rapprochement among the big Powers has not yet solved a single one of the many problems which preoccupy the minds of our peoples. Perhaps arrangements have been made among those Powers \nto satisfy their own interests, but we have yet to see their unified position with regard to the fundamental problems that beset our world, defiling it with war, pain and suffering. This, however, will not cause us to neglect to praise the rapprochement at present taking place between the People's Republic of China and Japan, a rapprochement between two great peoples in a great continent. Such relations can only benefit the struggle of man. One sure consequence will be the assertion that Asia belongs to the Asians and that the future of its peoples lies in self- determination, free from foreign intervention, which has so long sown the seeds of discord and dissension on that troubled continent.\n175.\tMay I be permitted to say that we do not hold a pessimistic outlook for the world in which we live. But we do wish to make it abundantly clear that the peoples of the United Nations are not truly represented in our Organization neither on the basis of those who speak on their behalf, nor on the basis of the questions chosen for discussion.\n176.\tThose who represent apartheid in South Africa, a system steeped in blood, shame and suppression, come to this rostrum and call for a war against terrorism. Now, who would agree that the right of man to be free and to regain his dignity can be attained by carrying olive branches against the big sticks, guns and rockets of the racists? The colonialist, racist Portuguese are engaged in daily barbaric acts against the indigenous African peoples, while their spokesman remains in our midst, arguing and threatening. The Government of the United Kingdom has called upon our conscience and demanded strict observance of morality, justice and humanity. What irony! That these demands come from the very country which is responsible for the untold suffering which man has endured in Palestine, Rhodesia and so many other parts of Africa and Asia is ironic indeed.\n177.\tColonialism planted the seeds of evil in all comers of the world and then slipped away when the price became too high to bear, leaving the victims behind to reap the bitter harvest of their ugly deeds.\n178.\tSuch an examination, available to us since the establishment of the United Nations and the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will clearly show the true nature of the problem. Those who commend the Charter are the very ones who violate it. Those who loudly observe the anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights are the very ones who rape the most basic rights of man and his fundamental freedoms. Perhaps the question may arise whether we, the peoples of the United Nations, still have a role to play. Yes, we do. Our role, as the Charter stipulates, is to be tolerant without forfeiting the rights of man, to be friendly without allowing the vindictive to have a place in our midst, to be candid without using distortion, and to be vocal in saying the truth without yielding to pressure. Our respect for the Charter has no place for aggressors, racists, colonialists and those who support them. Only by accepting this role can we affirm that the United Nations has fulfilled its Charter and justified its existence.\n179.\tSince the move to include in the agenda of this session an item on terrorism and violence, existing ill intentions against the Charter and the peoples of the United Nations have become apparent. The hasty inclusion of this item [item 92] was met with surprise by peoples in all corners of the world. For the questions of hijacking, assaults on diplomats and the senseless killing of innocent people and threats to their fundamental freedoms by terror and violence are not new in today's life. Some Member States officially practice such terror on a vast scale. The reaction of complete acceptance of this item by the racist and terrorist States is a \\\"ploy\\\" to use it gainfully against the legitimate struggle of the peoples under the yoke of colonialism and alien domination. We notice the fact that these circles tried to prevent a study of the causes of terrorism land violence in an attempt to isolate them from their roots. The reason behind this item and the hasty and artificial manner in which it was included, particularly before it was amended, is to use this forum to serve the temporary goals and propaganda purposes of certain States and criminal elements. Perhaps the awakening of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America will deny these elements the opportunity to use the flag of the United Nations as a means to wage war against the freedom fighters' constant struggle for the liberation of man.\n180.\tWe in Africa, Asia and Latin America know what violence is. We live it. Our wounds are still bleeding from it. When we fight it, we do not revert to divorcing it from its roots, from its causes and from the aspirations of those who are living it. Even the Second World War, which led to the formation of the United Nations to prevent the recurrence of war, was in itself a terrorism from which we suffered without participating in its causes or benefiting from its consequences. The fruits of war we enjoyed were the destruction of our towns, the killing of our sons and the suffocation of our freedoms for the sake of the belligerent big Powers. The only benefits we received from this international terrorism were racial discrimination and the seeds of Zionism and limited wars planted in our midst.\n181.\tLet us talk candidly about terrorism and international violence. Since this item was submitted, only those who practice official violence and terror against innocence and freedom discuss it in accordance with the true motives behind it. Zionist gangs have made of it a justification for their barbarous actions against Lebanon and Syria and have used it openly as a means to threaten other Arab States from this rostrum. The United States has used it as an expression of its support for these gangs and as an instrument in its election campaigns. The United Kingdom has used it to complete its chain of actions within the scope of its international policy. South Africa has used it to justify its laws and regulations against the freedom fighters. The list also includes Portugal and others which will try to give their criminal acts a fa\u00e7ade of legitimacy under the banner of the United Nations.\n182.\tMy delegation does not consider it appropriate that the United Nations should become, even for a few weeks, an instrument in local election campaigns or a pawn of international propaganda based on falsehood and deceit.\n183.\tLet us talk about the terror with which we all live, while the weapons of destruction are stockpiled in the warehouses of the super-Powers, threatening the total ruin of the world. Let us talk about the planes that pour tons of destructive weaponry on innocent people in Palestine and in North Viet-Nam. Let us talk about the destruction of dikes and the endangering of the lives of innocent millions. Let us talk about the fleets of the super-Powers that carry terrorism and violence outside their territorial waters, jeopardizing freedom of passage and international commerce. Let us talk about the mining of harbors without respect for the most basic concepts \\\" international law, and without even declaring a state of war.\n184.\tThe voice which has spoken from this rostrum on behalf of Zionist gangs was created as a result of connivance and concession, attained through pressure tactics and terrorism. Britain delivered the land and the people of Palestine to these usurping butchers who have abused the United Nations with the support of a super-Power. Ask that speaker about his original homeland and about the only justification for his presence in our occupied territory, and then we will talk about international terror and violence.\n185.\tWe said earlier that terrorism and violence are a disgrace to the colonial Powers and racist gangs, since they are themselves the roots and causes. But let me assure you that we are never ashamed of anything we do. We have contributed to the world a glowing and full history that does not need elaboration. Our behaviour, in spite of the terrorism of colonialism and the violence and criminal conspiracies of the big Powers against us, remains an exemplary contribution to human progress and to man's civilization. When the foundation of the civilization and the moralities of others are exposed to the dangers of concessions, conspiracies and pressures, our position will be firm and unequivocal. We will not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to see that truth is the law of man. The cheap attempts to censure our struggle and the struggle of our brothers in Africa will have only one consequence: namely, to let us know the stand of others against us. Through these very debates and discussions, we shall learn just who stands on the side of the struggle of man, and who tries in vain to obstruct it.\n186.\tThose who seek the creation of artificial storms under the guise of humanitarianism, and the adoption of a resolution or a recommendation by the United Nations on what they label as terrorism and violence are the very ones who openly refuse to implement the resolutions of the United Nations. They are the ones who show contempt for the United Nations by refusing to accept its decisions. Their lack of respect for this august body constitutes in itself a kind of terrorism against the peoples of the United Nations. We must never forget that the Arab peoples that are in a realistic and legitimate state of self-defense are fully aware that the solution of the Palestinian question-namely the problem of the liquidation of Zionist aggression, the taming of Zionist arrogance and the curbing of absolute support by the American fortress of capitalist imperialism-will come only when a practical decision is taken by the Arab peoples themselves: the decision to wage a total war of liberation that will be vindicated by international norms and moral laws and will be dictated by the fundamental human rights to combat aggression and liberate national land from the gangs that occupy it.\n187.\tLet us be realistic and logical. The Charter, human rights and humane motives are no longer the main stimuli in the United Nations. Contrary to the wishes of the peoples of the world, the United Nations has become a puppet whose strings are pulled by influential hands. This is a tragic end to a great human endeavor in a world governed by inhumane motives and greedy self-interest.\n188.\tCertain States have practiced infamous and dastardly terror on our soil which, though the subject of continuous complaint, is yet without sufficient condemnation to place the responsibility where it belongs.\n189.\tIn this age of well-publicized concern for the preservation of our ecological environment, let us speak also of the terrorism against our human environment: the mass destruction of our own species. The Arabs are victims of such terrorism. We call for study and the identification of those who are responsible for it. We were among the first to be against Nazi and Fascist terrorism. We fought it at a time when others sought a truce with terror and condoned its ugly practices against our people with resolutions and agreements. Then, when others joined our fight, we continued our struggle to the best of our ability. Finally, when the war was over, the belligerents concluded peace at our expense and without due consideration for our existence. We committed ourselves to be there and without arrogance or selfishness to contribute our humble effort to mankind.\n190.\tThe Second World War left a terror that is still in our midst, as witnessed by the systematic and premeditated planting of mines in our land. War no longer exists among the advanced societies which tested their weaponry on our soil and tried their instruments of terror on our people. Let us call them to account for those practices. The planting of mines in the soil of the Libyan Arab Republic and other North African States was an instrument of war used equally by the Allies and the Axis nations. When the war was terminated, those mines were left to defile our human environment, to explode in the faces of our innocent men, women and children, and so to hinder in an effective manner our progress and our development.\n191.\tFrom a humanitarian point of view, it was imperative that the belligerent States, which later became friends, should give us an indication of the existence of those mines which jeopardized innocent lives and prevented innocent people from exercising their fundamental liberties. But, without a single exception, all refrained from performing this humane and legal duty, leaving it to time and to mines to \\\"solve\\\" our problems. The Libyan Arab Republic will not stand idly by, politically or juridically. It will not refrain from asking the States responsible for planting its soil with mines to pay reparations for this inhuman act.\n192.\tSome States have included in the agenda of the United Nations certain tangential items which have been blown up and exaggerated by the mass media. But we believe that the time has come to identify the responsibility for and show the true cause of the deterioration of the world situation. Terrorism and violence and the pollution of the human environment are undoubtedly latent, in spite of the propaganda campaigns, in the inhuman behavior of certain elements and the States that support those who pollute the life of man and defile it. Let us remove the hand of colonialism and exploitation from the peoples of the\nUnited Nations so that this international gathering will be a true representation of its peoples. Let the people of Namibia come to this hall. Let us remove the grip of Ian Smith and his gang from Rhodesia. Let us condemn the attempts of some States to collaborate with the two racist regimes, in South Africa and Rhodesia.\n193.\tLet us emphatically and with one voice issue a true and courageous proclamation that we are against the colonial presence of Portugal in Africa and against some of the major Powers that support Portugal's strangulation of the freedoms of the indigenous populations.\n194.\tLet us state with a clear voice that the one who speaks on behalf of the Zionist gangs is a racist, Fascist and Nazi, to whom we should not even listen. Let our human environment be purified of the causes of terror and violence, and let all the peoples of the United Nations attain what the Charter has stipulated.\n195.\tThe world has changed measurably since the adoption of the Charter. Those changes must be taken into consideration for two reasons. First, the United Nations must be given the effectiveness to prevent its resolutions from being subject to concession and deliberate rejection, consequently restoring its respect and prestige. Second, a true reflection of the world today must include peoples that should be given the opportunity to enrich man's history and contribute to the discussion of his problems.\n196.\tThe Arabic language is of great cultural and historical value, having made major contributions to civilization contributions that can be neither ignored nor belittled. It is the language of scores of millions of men; it constitutes a religious reference to hundreds of millions of Moslems all over the world. This language has become a working reality in many of the specialized agencies and human gatherings, a fast which makes it imperative to give it wider scope among the languages of the United Nations. The acceptance of Arabic as an official language of the United Nations will contribute immensely to world literature and civilization.\n197.\tThe discussion of the universality of the Organization and the admission of new Members brings us once more to the discussion of the Charter. We cannot agree that the super-Powers have the right to force upon the Organization delegations which do not represent their peoples, or membership for governments which were created as a result of international conspiracies.\n198.\tThe debate on the admission of new Members, as included in the agenda [item 23], is a waste of time and will lead us only to polemics and futile discussion. The most practical procedure remains a recommendation by the Security Council, followed by a debate in the General Assembly; any other procedure will inevitably lead to pain and anxieties which will not serve the interests of this world Organization.\n199.\tWe would like to emphasize that any review of the situation of the world today necessitates the compiling of a list of priorities for our debates and also a longer period of debate to enable us responsibly to solve world problems and ensure world progress. The search for peace and security and the stabilization of relations will not be found in the settlements by the rich and big Powers at the expense of the poor and smaller States or at the expense of the colonized and oppressed peoples.\n200.\tBefore we can achieve true peace and effective security and before we can preserve the lives of the innocent and protect the fundamental freedoms of man, we have to do the following things: first, liquidate all forms and manifestations of colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism; secondly, put an end to the crime of racial discrimination and violations of human rights; thirdly, place the responsibility on the big Powers and other colonial nations for the consequences of their actions and call upon them to participate effectively and in good faith in the solution of the problems created by the tragedies they have caused; and fourthly, review the affairs of our international system, the manner of representation in it and the enforcement of respect for its resolutions and recommendations.\n201.\tThe eyes of the world should be focused upon the solution of the fundamental problems, in order to create true stability for future generations, to safeguard them from the scourge of war and to establish conditions that are conducive to progress and prosperity.\n202.\tInjustice of man to man exists, and it is a bitter reality. It will continue, for it cannot be fought with resolutions of international organizations which lack the power to enforce those resolutions or even the will and desire to respect them. Injustice, partiality and alignment remain characteristics of man, especially in international organizations. A world built in such a manner does not augur well, nor does it promise a better future, permanent stability or a just peace. Nevertheless, we assert that the settlement of global problems and the improvement of the gloomy world situation lie in the perseverance and endurance of the peoples of the world and in the determination of man to make this planet a healthy place to live in. For man is the main pillar of the peoples of the United Nations, and he will create peace, security and prosperity.\n203.\tWith your permission, Mr. President, before I leave the rostrum I should like to say a few more words, which are not in my Arabic text.\n204.\tToday, Monday, is the first day of the holy Moslem month of Ramadan in the year 1392 of the Moslem calendar, a holy month of fasting, prayer and meditation observed by hundreds of millions of Moslems around the world, millions of human beings of all races and colors and from all regions and nations of our planet. On this occasion, on behalf of the Revolutionary Command Council, the Libyan people and the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic, I should like to convey to our Moslem brothers in this Assembly and to the whole Islamic community throughout the world our sincere congratulations and good wishes.\n205.\tI want also to take this special occasion to stress our belief that we Moslems are determined to contribute to the advancement of humanity and to join in a sincere effort to bring serenity, justice and peace to this troubled world. In keeping with our faith and our cultural heritage, as well as our traditional humanism and tolerance, we shall continue our sacred fight, our jihad, against Zionism, imperialism, colonialism, racism and exploitation wherever they exist in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Brazil is attending the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly in the conviction that the intense diplomatic activity which has in recent months attracted the attention of our foreign ministries should be the subject of thorough study, not only because this diplomatic activity will have an impact on the general interests of the international community, but also because we shall thus be able to gage its compatibility with our Organization's specific competence and objectives.\n3.\tBefore I undertake such an analysis, allow me, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your unanimous election and to express my gratification at seeing you preside over our work; for I also bear in mind that you represent a country whose sons migrated to Brazil in substantial numbers and, by their productive efforts and perfect integration into the open and multiracial Brazilian society, contributed in large measure to the progress of their adopted homeland.\n4.\tIn addition, I would avail myself of this opportunity to convey to Mr. Adam Malik my appreciation for the serene and correct manner in which he presided over the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly.\n5.\tIt is also my wish to reiterate to Mr. Waldheim, whom I have so often met in other diplomatic forums, the satisfaction that my Government and I myself experienced upon his assumption of the responsibilities of Secretary- General of the United Nations. His sense of mission, already evidenced during the brief period in which he has been exercising the functions so worthily discharged by his predecessors, and his diplomatic experience which we all acknowledge and which contributed so decisively to his unanimous election to a post so exacting, yet so full of possibilities-all these qualifications are the best assurance of a reactivation of the role that the United Nations, through its Secretary-General, should play in the international political field. I am certain that in my words of greeting Mr. Waldheim will detect not only the affectionate message of a colleague and friend of many years standing but also and chiefly the conviction held by the Foreign Minister of a country whose international involvement keeps up with its growth that our Secretary-General possesses the indispensable qualities of moderation and dynamism required by the office he occupies. Proof of his capacity for taking the initiative to bring to the attention of the United Nations major problems we are now facing was the solemn appeal he addressed to the General Assembly to find the most appropriate means to combat terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger and take innocent human lives [A/8791 and Add.lJ.\n6.\tIt is, in my view, most deplorable that the Assembly has failed to endorse the wording of item 92 as recommended by the General Committee [see A/8800/Rev.l, para. 18]. After the voting on the amendments presented at the plenary meeting last Saturday night [2037th meeting], the Brazilian delegation stressed two points that we deemed essential to clarify our position: first, we cannot accept terrorism, or any form of violence, as a legitimate political instrument; secondly, the wording of the item as finally adopted contains expressions which have been frequently used in attempts to justify or even tolerate terrorism. We are seriously concerned lest this wording encourage attempts at undue interference in matters falling within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of States and consequently lead to acrimonious and sterile debates.\n7.\tIt is not only in recent days that we have been concerned with the problem of terrorism which has affected so many countries, including my own, as is generally known. In January and February 1971 the General Assembly of the Organization of American States met at Washington in extraordinary session to attempt to establish on the regional level a juridical order capable of facing up to and overcoming this intolerable threat to the peace and well-being of our peoples. However, the limited results then obtained did not constitute, in our opinion, an adequate instrument with which to meet this pressing need, as subsequent tragic events have unfortunately proved. I do not feel it necessary to recall the clear and forceful position that Brazil has always adopted with regard to this grave problem. Nor is it my purpose to recall here recent history which must certainly still be in the minds of all. What I wish is to launch now, in this world forum, a vehement appeal for us to hanker to the outcry which requires our statesmen and government leaders to take practical and immediate measures to defend the most elementary principles which should preside over social relationships.\n8.\tWe are not prompted by any political preference or any ideological bias when we declare that it is urgent, that it is indispensable, for us to unite and organize ourselves with firmness and determination against the hideous and indiscriminate violence of terrorism to which each and every country has become exposed; indeed, this brooks no delay. We continue to maintain that this indiscriminate violence gives the outright lie to the thesis that terrorist subversion is the fruit of social injustice or of the poverty of a given society.\n9.\tAt this juncture let us be truly the \\\"United Nations\\\", regardless of our respective and different ideological convictions or patterns of political organization, and let us heed this clamor and be firm and united in the struggle for the final extirpation of violence in any of its forms.\n10.\tThe Brazilian nation celebrates this year the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence. The civic enthusiasm with which we commemorate our entry, a century and a half ago, into the community of sovereign States strengthens our determination to build our national destiny in the certainty that, to progress, Brazil must rely on itself and on the work of its people, and to build it in the conviction that this development can be accelerated by the establishment and maintenance of that peace and security which will ensure to each and every one of the members of the international community the right to progress and to stability as well as a sovereign voice and an active presence in the formulation of the world political order. Brazil's diplomacy, which it is today incumbent upon me to conduct, abides fully by the traditions of understanding and negotiation bestowed upon us by our elders.\n11.\tFor the past 26 years Brazil has been given the privilege and responsibility of opening our general debate, a custom which brings me to this rostrum as the first speaker for the third consecutive session of the Assembly. This tradition also presents the challenge of initiating a critical analysis of the international political scene in the light of the diplomatic events of the past 12 months and from the angle of the repercussions that same activity will have on this broad and irreplaceable forum for the harmonization of the external behavior of States which is the United Nations.\n12.\tContemporary international political relationships are characterized by the complexity, extensiveness and swiftness of their evolution. No less characteristic of the times in which we live is the unrelenting persistence of situations and ways of action which Brazil considers ethically unjust, politically anachronistic and juridically condemnable. The conflicting interaction between a new concept of peace and security-new because it is as young as the aspirations we inscribed in our Charter-and the old patterns of international behavior, which we have not yet succeeded in superseding, is basically responsible for the crises and tensions which still exist on the large stage of inter-State relations.\n \n13.\tIt is not that I am unaware of, or appreciate any the less, the encouraging progress that we are achieving, little by little, along the intricate path of reconciling differences and in the search for the easing of tensions. But I cannot fail to deplore the fact that this slow progress towards the realization of our ideals of peace and security is being attained amidst contradictions and paradoxes, for there continue to weigh on the horizons of the world, albeit apparently less heavily, the dense clouds of nuclear confrontation; a kind of suspended sentence of doom hovers over mankind as a whole. Neither the doctrine nor the practice of strategic balance, nor arbitrary compositions among the poles of international power, have succeeded in extinguishing the fires of regional conflicts. The attempt to coexist within a strategic arrangement or, in other words, the contemporary \\\"balance of prudence\\\" referred to by the Secretary-General [A/8701lAdd.l, p. ./] determines the outstanding bilateral diplomatic activity in which the great Powers are currently engaged and reflects the complex problems of today's international reality.\n14.\tBut it so happens that the easing of tensions and coexistence are not synonymous with the peace and security we pursued when founding the United Nations. Rather they are palliatives, perhaps opportune in the circumstances, but inadequate and insufficient, serving only to render the political atmosphere less oppressive, yet still not succeeding in brightening it. In fact, to be lasting and fruitful, the easing of tensions should be more than a mere expedient resorted to by the predominant Powers as a function of their national interests.\n15.\tOur sense of reality obliges us to recognize the pragmatic merit of the various initiatives which have enabled us to leap over the walls of dissension and irreducible ideological conflict and pass from the sterile and sombre cold-war years to this period of dialog. But it is indispensable and urgent that the spreading awareness of the impossibility and irrationality of a final nuclear confrontation should result in the institutionalization of an equitable system of international peace and security. I submit that this system, to be enduring and universally accepted, has to be built within the framework of the United Nations and legitimized by it; for this is the true, the genuine, normative forum of inter-State relations.\n16.\tA few months ago, after a long period of waiting that became more and more anxious in view of the unbridled increase in the means of mass destruction at the disposal of the super-Powers, the international community was informed of the first and meager results of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks results which in the final analysis reflect the interests of the microcosm of strategical parity.\n17.\tIt is worth-while asking whether the subsystem of lateral pacts is to supersede the United Nations and even override it, or whether our Organization prevails over these pacts and retains its right to appraise and sanction them. So long as strategic parity per se remains the goal, or so long as this parity is construed as the only possible condition and guarantee for peace, this peace will, by definition, be unstable and fleeting.\n18.\tRecent and explicit references to an alleged primacy of the security interests of the great Powers to which lesser interests and, viewed from that perspective, supposedly parochial interests should be subordinated betray the original assumption that some countries can act in consonance with special responsibilities which would politically validate their conduct. The logical consequence of such a doctrine and its ensuing application relegate to a category of secondary objectives the implementation of an effective system of international security in conformity with the conceptual terms of the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n19.\tThe considerations of Realpolitik, which at San Francisco influenced the composition and functioning of the Security Council, are not enough to justify bypassing the mechanisms for action envisaged in the Charter, as is increasingly occurring, through negotiations in lateral forums of restricted membership, without the active presence of the medium-sized and small Powers. It is beyond question, in our view, that the participation of the medium-sized and small Powers would be highly constructive and creative; it would be tantamount to an infusion of new blood, which might serve to heal the sclerosis of structures that have aged apparently without being aware of it. How can one deny the validity of the claim to a broader role for the international community in the solution of problems that, after all, are of collective' world interest?\n20.\tWe are asked to be realistic. Well, then, let us be truly realistic and take advantage of the atmosphere of detente, the momentum provided by the initiatives that in Europe have resulted in the accommodation of interests through the German-Soviet and German-Polish treaties and the Berlin agreements, which have opened favorable prospects for a future conference on European security. And let us apply this momentum to the international scene as a whole by making full use of the diplomatic mechanisms available in our Organization. Let us give a voice and role in building true peace and lasting security to all of us gathered here, persuaded as we are that the destiny of each of us is closely intertwined with that of all the others, that the development of the poor segment of mankind is a condition for the stability of the wealthy segment of humanity, and that peace and security both political and economic-are inseparable.\n21.\tThese same purposes of reconciling points of view and of accommodating legitimate sovereign interests enabled us at Santiago to further negotiations on so many important matters falling within the competence of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]; and in Stockholm to achieve fairly appreciable results towards the solution of the major problem of safeguarding the human environment.\n22.\tThe Brazilian Government considers that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment attained its stated objectives, namely, to arrive at a common \\\"to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment\\\".    The normative and operational framework adopted in Stockholm provides the bases for broad international co-operation in the preservation of the environment and indicates rational criteria to serve as guidelines for the sovereign action of States in the exploitation of their natural resources, in accordance with their national plans and priorities and without undue interference.\n23.\tThe unwavering defense that Brazil has undertaken, and will continue to maintain, of the sovereign right of each State to make full economic use of the resources of its territory for the benefit of its own people does not preclude recognition of its responsibility to carry out its development plans without risk of significant damage to the environment of bordering areas. Our attitude in this regard can be illustrated by the positions we have been taking, in all good faith and in the best spirit of good neighborliness, at the regional forum which specifically deals with this subject and where, we believe, practical solutions that meet all the interests at stake can always be found.\n24.\tDespite the persistence of serious situations of conflict I recognize that, in many aspects, the evolution of international relations appears to be following a more constructive course. But the conspicuous absence of the United Nations from the whole process of the easing of tensions, as though the flow of the major currents of negotiation had been diverted in order to bypass our Organization, has engendered a crisis of confidence and a feeling of frustration which limit the normative capacity of the United Nations. We are obliged to acknowledge that we have not as yet been able to assert the juridical and ethical preeminence of our constitutional document, nor have we been able in the political and security field to render the Organization fully operative.\n25.\tI am stressing the political and security field inasmuch as in the economic and social spheres the performance of the United Nations is less discouraging. Economic cooperation and assistance, as we understand them today and as we intend to develop them further, are products of the consciousness which was born and raised in this very hall and which has in fact enlarged the scope of Chapter IX of the Charter and converted into reality many ideas originally expressed as timid aspirations. I emphasize this fact because the General Assembly christened and sponsored many initiatives which were later shaped in other organisms of our system because the Economic and Social Council did not bestir itself in time to deal with the multifarious problems of economic development and did not exercise its responsibilities in the area of policy-making and co-ordination.\n26.\tIn any critical analysis of the United Nations there must be a chapter acknowledging the merits of our Organization or, if one prefers, the merits of its General Assembly-in activating, in giving form and substance to the aspirations to assistance and co-operation nurtured by the large majority of its membership.\n271 There remains, of course, much very much more to do, in this field. Many myths must be destroyed and much conservatism must be eliminated if we are to make more effective and more active the rendering of international assistance by the rich countries to the poor ones; in order, in a word, to reshape at last the international division of labor, so that the mechanisms of co-operation can function in a manner less hindered by such preconceptions, myths and conservatism. It has been a long and patient effort which is beginning to thrive and which can flourish if we are willing to fertilize other ideas sown in the Charter, ideas that interrelate collective economic security and collective political security.\n28.\tThat is the path recently shown us by the Secretary - General, with the authority vested in him, when he said:\n\u201c... development issues which in the past might have been local or regional in character today affect the entire world and should therefore be dealt with at the international community level... economic problems, just as political and military disputes, affected world security. Collective economic security was therefore a necessary correlate to the concept of collective political security. The concept of collective economic security would give added life and meaning to the International Development Strategy and its review and appraisal mechanism.\n\u201cIt was most timely and appropriate that, at a time when the Economic and Social Council was in the process of self-renewal, it should give serious and careful consideration to this idea and to the practical ways it could be realized.\u201d\n29.\tHere I wish to convey the satisfaction of my Government with the endorsement by the Secretary-General of the Brazilian concept of collective economic security. He has granted this concept the passport with which we hope it will travel through the international economic thinking of the 1970s. It is not Brazil's intention to advocate that we should hasten to arrive at a final formulation of this concept, or that we should hurry to put it into operation, thus risking its faulty, incomplete or insufficient implementation. Quite to the contrary, what we propose is wide-open, frank dialog; what we expect is that we shall work together to refine this concept and to formulate its operational principles. The Brazilian delegation will return to this subject on the proper occasion, in the proper forum, with the sole intent of contributing to the strengthening and improvement of the foundations on which world peace and security should rest.\n30.\tLet me now sum up the main line of reasoning of this presentation.\n31.\tIf the process of international organization is irreversible, inasmuch as it embodies a universally shared aspiration and inasmuch as it is a constant in the historical evolution of inter-State relations, why does our Organization so frequently find itself bypassed? Does this situation derive from an option by .some countries not to utilize the Organization as an organ of collective decision? Or is the weakening of the United Nations to be attributed to structural deficiencies stemming from its institutional stagnation, from its inadequacy vis-a-vis contemporary international reality, already so distinct from that prevailing at the end of the Second World War, which the Charter had to mirror?\n32.\tWhatever the reasons for the progressive political, diplomatic and even financial impoverishment of the United Nations, it is urgent to reinvigorate our Organization, to fortify it as a converging center for international politics, to make it regain control over the revamping of the system of inter-State relations, for only the United Nations can provide the juridical-political parameters of conciliation between legitimate national interests and what suits the collective interest.\n33.\tThe diplomatic marginalization of the United Nations has been and still is derived to a large extent from its institutional aging process, which reduces its procedural capacity to transform words into action, will into deeds, determination into reality. The Charter of the United Nations is to international relations what national constitutions are to the domestic political-juridical order of Member States. No written constitution has historically succeeded in remaining unaltered. As the societies to which they apply change and evolve, national constitutions evolve and change to avoid becoming a dead letter as the result of refusing to acknowledge and to institutionalize new situations and new social facts. We are currently witnessing at the international level a growing gap between constitutional norms and reality. This is the normative gap, I would say, now being added to the other gaps which so afflict two thirds of mankind.\n34.\tObviously, the degree of effectiveness of the United Nations is less dependent upon the text of the Charter than upon the political will of States to respect and implement its purposes and principles; it is no less true that any anachronistic norms become in themselves a hindrance to evolution and that the over-validity of supplanted institutions discourages the exercise of that same political will.\n35.\tThe Brazilian Government holds that the only alternative is adaptation and reform.\n36.\tMy Government fully acknowledges all that is permanent and valuable in our Charter. From this very rostrum, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, I launched an appeal for us to apply the Charter in its high normative sense, and for us to make full use of the diplomatic capabilities of our Organization.  Thus, as I reiterate Brazil's total adherence to the purposes and principles, I also maintain that it is high time to improve the Charter. I find it a fallacious argument that if we were to redraft the Charter, the political conditions of today would prevent us from producing a document as valuable as the one drawn up in 1945. In this argument there is implicit the pessimistic assumption that, in the course of these past 27 years, the world has become worse and statesmen have become less rational.\n37.\tIt is not the intention of the Brazilian Government to suggest that we rewrite the Charter; what is in fact incumbent upon us is to revitalize our constitutional document, to correct its inadequacies, to update it, and, if I may say so, to adapt it to a world that is already distant from the international reality of the post-war period.\n38.\tInterpreting the will of our Governments, the drafters of the Charter themselves acknowledged, with the humility of true statesmen, that they had not produced a perfect and everlasting document. In Article 109 they themselves foresaw and affirmed the need for reform in setting a time-limit for review, a process considered indispensable for the United Nations to endure and advance. I should like to recall that, as early as in San Francisco, the Brazilian delegation, aware of the changeability of the times, suggested that the Charter should be reviewed automatically every five years irrespective of the veto.  When are we to follow the course of action so wisely set forth in Article 109?\n39.\tThe Brazilian Government believes that a review and eventual reform of the Charter would decisively contribute to stimulating the political will of States to utilize the avenues of the international Organization in the most effective and comprehensive manner, to render the Organization itself operative and dynamic, at the service of a world in such an obvious phase of transition.\n40.\tIn replying to the questionnaire of the Secretary-General [see A/8746], my Government has already indicated those matters which in its opinion should be assigned first priority in connexion with a review of the Charter. Specific reference was made to the concept of collective economic security and to peace-keeping operations. We also presented suggestions regarding the enhancement of the effectiveness of the Security Council. And, while stressing the inter-connexion between these different subjects, we noted that the debate on the item concerning the review of the Charter would offer an opportunity for an in-depth examination of all related issues and positions of principle having a bearing on the work of the Security Council as well as on its organizational structure. This issue calls for a thorough and unbiased re-evaluation, free from considerations based on the outdated power structure of the immediate post-war period.\n41.\tThe acceleration of the pace of international relations and the growing development of the communications media afford the emerging countries the opportunity to break out of the historic isolation in which they have been living and to project their national interests on the international plane. Domestic development concurrently broadens international obligations; growth increases international responsibilities and, consequently, commitments and duties. Brazil has long since made its irreversible choice in favor of all that presupposes clarity and harmony, in favor of just and correct relations with other nations, of good faith in discharging obligations, and systematically rejects the theses of separate paths of progress and of the false rights stemming from power.\n42.\tNew life should urgently be given to the ideals of collective security which inspired the Charter, in the form of a system of more operative norms that better encompass contemporary reality,, these norms being firmly linked to germane principles of sovereign equality and equality of opportunity among States.\n43.\tTrue political realism consists in trying to construct a permanent international order founded on collective consensus. This Assembly is the forum par excellence to expand the understandings arrived at among a few on matters of interest to so many, and to render these understandings beneficial to all. It is incumbent upon the United Nations, where the organized international community is represented, to assume the final and untransferable responsibility for forging the bases of an equitable system of international co-operation, to build peace and to defend it.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure that you, Mr. President, a distinguished diplomat of a friendly socialist country with which Ethiopia has the best of relations, should be at the helm of the Assembly while I am speaking today. Your election to the presidency is a fitting tribute both to your country's contribution to the work of .the United Nations and to your personal qualities as a public figure of distinction. Please accept my heartfelt felicitations.\n139.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to Foreign Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia for his wise and able leadership of the last session of the General Assembly.\n140.\tAll of the previous Secretaries-General have left an enduring mark on world affairs. UThant will best be remembered for having built up the moral stature of the office of the Secretary-General to great heights.\n141.\tIn the 10 months he has been in office, Mr. Kurt Waldheim has justified the confidence we have shown in him by electing him to be our Secretary-General. In keeping with the tradition of his predecessors, he has worked tirelessly to lend the moral force of the United Nations and the instruments of its diplomacy to the solution of some of the problems besetting the world today. I know we all recognize that in this endeavor he needs all the support and encouragement that we can give him.\n142.\tOnce again we are engaged in an exercise of introspection. However much we may exhort each other to be candid with ourselves, I do not believe that any of us can claim today to have the remedy for our ills. The problem is in our vision; we all tend to look at the world through the colored glasses of our national history and experience; our perspectives seem to be affected by our geographical position.\n143.\tIf the general debate at the United Nations has proved anything in the past, it has been that no one has a monopoly of truth. It is therefore necessary that we should refrain from what we may believe to be righteous indignation; we should rather concentrate on explaining problems as we see them from our particular vantage-points. If we succeed in doing this dispassionately and with the minimum of recrimination, there might be some hope that we can begin to understand each other's positions a little better.\n144.\tOur assessments of the international scene this year may differ, but we must agree that never before have developments given more cause for hope and disappointment at the same time. Some of the big Powers which only a year ago were hardly on speaking terms not only have begun to talk to each other but have also opened up the areas of trade and accommodation. Those big Powers which used to speak to each other with raised voices have lowered their voices and have begun to listen to each other, while exploring together grounds for agreement and common action.\n145.\tThe seating of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations;, the visit of the President of the United States to the People's Republic of China and the opening of channels of communications between the two countries; the visit of the President of the United States to the Soviet Union and the agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States to limit strategic nuclear missiles; the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin all these are significant and positive developments.\n146.\tIn the wake of big-Power rapprochement others have followed suit. The two Germanys and the two Koreas, which for long have remained estranged from each other, have begun talks. Determined to end their long confrontation, India and Pakistan began negotiations on the morrow of hostilities.\n147.\tIndeed, if one were to judge the improvements that have taken place in the last year in relations among the big Powers by the yardstick of post-war history, these developments could be considered important breakthroughs. Under normal circumstances, such salutary developments would have been strong enough to create a self-sustaining momentum for peace. But these are not normal times. Regrettably, for every positive development we have ob-served we can point to another which has complicated the search for solutions to conflicts.\n148.\tIt is both pertinent and timely to ask this Assembly why the recently manifested detente in the relations of the big Powers has not led to a significant lessening of tensions everywhere.\n149.\tThe continuation of the Viet-Nam conflict and the frozen situation in the Middle East have undoubtedly limited the scope of the detente. Our failure to make a dent in the last citadel of colonialism in southern Africa has also dampened the enthusiasm which would have been otherwise justified. The rising trend of violence directed against national leaders, diplomatic envoys, international passengers and innocent civilians bodes ill for a world which was just getting accustomed to conciliation instead of confrontation.\n150.\tTo the extent that one is able to draw up a balance-sheet of such complex developments, one can venture to say that certain developments on the international scene this year seem to portend better times. But whether those portents will materialize in a durable peace will depend on what all of us, and particularly the big Powers, will do to sustain those efforts on a much broader front.\n151.\tIt is not only the cumulative force of those small forward steps that will determine in the long run whether we will have a better world; even more important will be what we do to avoid the false steps, the tilings that can undo what has been painstakingly constructed over a period of several years. Active hostilities, or a situation of near hostilities in some regions, and colonialism cannot coexist for long with improvements in other parts of the world. As has so often happened in the past, those counter-currents will sooner or later win out.\n152.\tFor the first time in a long while we have something going for peace. We should not let it stop for lack of momentum. We have to give it all the push we can.\n153.\tIt is in that context that we must realize that we have more than ever the duty to resolve the hostilities in Viet-Nam, the near hostilities in the Middle East and the problem of colonialism in southern Africa and move forward in those areas of great concern to the whole of mankind: disarmament, economic development and the establishment of a mutually beneficial system of international co-operation.\n154.\tMy Government has always believed that the solution to the Viet-Nam hostilities can be achieved not through their intensification, but through the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the provision of an opportunity to the VietNamese people to determine the political and social system under which they wish to live.\n155.\tWe have similarly expressed from this rostrum what in our judgment are the requirements for a just and equitable peace in the Middle East. The present situation of a smoldering stalemate cannot be tolerated any longer, for it contains within it the fuel for sudden eruption. So often have we witnessed the vicious cycle of violence in the Middle East that we should not now fail to realize how the present situation incubates blind violence; how one hostile action invites a counteraction more deadly and destructive than the act that provoked it; how this leads to frustration and raises the level of violence to yet higher and more dangerous levels. If peace is to have any chance, this cycle must be broken and the trend reversed.\n156.\tIn this respect we continue to believe that the diplomatic process that offers the best prospect is the one initiated by the Security Council. We also believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains a balanced set of obligations which all the parties have to accept. The fulfillment by the parties concerned of all the obligations contained in resolution 242(1967) must be vigorously pursued.\n157.\tBy common consensus, the colonial situation in southern Africa has given us no reason for hope; if anything, it has been a source of growing frustration and tension.\n158.\tThe African people of Zimbabwe have overwhelmingly rejected the so-called \\\"proposals for a settlement\\\" worked out without their participation by Ian Smith and the British Government. During the days when they were being ostensibly consulted, the world witnessed spontaneous uprisings in several cities in Zimbabwe, uprisings which may be merely a portent of things to come. In the meantime the military alliance between South Africa and Southern Rhodesia has been strengthened, and apartheid has been nurtured to spread and deepen its roots in Zimbabwe.\n159.\tYet nothing has been done to strengthen the one action that promises results, that is, the effective implementation of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia. On the contrary the sanctions have not only been successfully evaded, but even whittled down.\n160.\tThe hostilities in the Territories under Portuguese domination are growing in scope and intensity. Except for information that has been provided by our discussions here and by the United Nations Secretariat, the public at large has been kept in the dark by a conspiracy of silence about the three brutal wars being waged by Portugal. In this regard, the visit of the United Nations Special Mission which visited the liberated areas of Guinea (Bissau) has done much to focus attention on one of these wars. The report of the Special Mission [A/8723/Rev. 1, chap. X, annex I] has also been very informative as to the needs of the liberation movements in Africa and the ways in which the United Nations can help them.\n161.\tDespite the Secretary-General's efforts on behalf of the United Nations, the prospect of independence for Namibia is as remote as ever. Like many others, we have continued to hope against hope that South Africa will yet be prevailed upon to change. But I regret to say that the Secretary-General's latest report [A/8724] does not permit any such optimism. So long as South Africa does not accept United Nations responsibility for Namibia, and so long as South Africa is not ready to transfer power to the Namibians, I do not believe there can be any justifiable hope. We have thus to recognize the wide gulf that still separates South Africa from the rest of the world. We should also be careful not to let South Africa use its talks with the Secretary-General as a public relations build-up.\n162.\tThe situation in South Africa itself has in the past year been the object of world-wide attention. The oppression of Africans and Asians and of those white people who have dared to question the wisdom of apartheid has increased. At the same time the South African authorities are painstakingly creating an elaborate structure of apartheid, transplanting people from one area to another and herding them in what in the language of their reverse logic they call \\\"homelands\\\".\n163.\tThe first meetings of the Security Council to be held in Africa, in Addis Ababa, were significant in one important respect: they helped to focus world public opinion on the problems of colonialism in southern Africa and underscored the great concern of the international community with the deterioration of the situation. It also brought the United Nations closer to the people who need its assistance most.\n164.\tThe time has come for the United Nations to look at colonialism as one interconnected problem requiring concerted international action. The colonialist regimes them-selves have for long realized how dependent their positions have become on concerting their defence against what they consider to be the dangerous onslaught of independence. In the face of that, I wonder how long we can afford to look at these colonial problems separately, and even more, still hope to win the battle against colonialism by resorting to uncoordinated actions.\n165.\tIn keeping with this objective we believe that the international community should seriously consider taking concerted action against all the colonial regimes in southern Africa in order to deny them weapons which they can use to suppress the people and in order to sever all economic and commercial ties with them. In this context we should also reject all semantic distinctions between those weapons likely to be used for defensive purposes and those likely to be used for offensive purposes, or between economic ties likely to benefit the majority of the people or those likely to benefit the minority. There are no defensive weapons per se it all depends on how they are used. Similarly, no economic ties which strengthen the oppressor can be, at the same time, of real benefit to those oppressed.\n166.\tWhat is required is a little more courage. My August Sovereign, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, recalled this poignantly when, addressing the Special Session of the Security Council held in Africa, he said:\n\\\"Throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have acted, the indifference of those who should have known better, the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most, that has made it possible for evil to triumph. The glorious pages of human history have been written only in those moments when men have been able to act in concert to prevent impending tragedies. By the actions you take, you can also illuminate the pages of history.\\\" \n167.\tWe believe that, if the international community were to show some readiness to move in this direction, if it were only to take, for example, such limited steps as restricting future investments in the economies of these territories; there might perhaps be some hope for progress. But in most of these territories exactly the opposite is happening. Investment is increasing in all the Portuguese territories. With the completion of the Cabora Bassa dam in Mozambique, more investments, as well as an influx of overseas immigrants, are expected. In Namibia, in particular, large sums of money are being spent on mineral exploration and exploitation.\n168.\tThere is no question that, if improvement in the southern African situation is to come, the major trading partners of the colonialist and racist regimes will have to reverse their priorities and be guided by their long-term economic gains, rather than by their calculations of such gains over the short-term. So long as they fail to do that they will continue to assume a particularly significant responsibility for the prolongation of this tragic situation.\n169.\tThe African Members of the United Nations have continued to address themselves to the same problems under the aegis of the OAU. They have spared no effort to assist the liberation movements to carry out vigorously their struggle against colonial and racist domination. I wish to express the hope that the United Nations as a whole will adopt some of the measures recommended by the OAU.\n170.\tIn the interdependent world of today the battle for peace will have to be waged in all regions and on all fronts. We should not slacken our efforts in prosecuting this struggle.\n171.\tIn addition to resolving actual conflicts we have to prevent others from arising. We also have to make constant efforts to promote what the Charter of the United Nations calls \\\"conditions\\\" for peace.\n172.\tNothing could be more urgent in this respect at this point in time than to work for disarmament, economic and social development, and the strengthening of the United Nations.\n173.\tWe cannot allow the world to go on spending over $200 billion a year on armaments and only $7 billion for economic aid-one being 30 times more than the other without inviting instability in much of the world today. Through disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, we should remove one of the principal causes of fear and suspicion. We should free resources that can be used to meet the real needs of people in the rich and poor countries alike. By helping to create an effective system of international economic co-operation designed to help the developing countries develop faster, we also should be removing a principal source of instability and of much of the unhappiness born out of unmet needs.\n174.\tProgress in the past year in these two areas has generally been slow, but some advances have also been made.\n175.\tThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have yielded limited but significant results. The agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States to limit strategic defensive and offensive missiles are undoubtedly important arms control measures. They will help slow down the dangerous momentum of the arms race. If followed by other arms control and disarmament measures, they may even signal the reversal of a trend. I cannot emphasize too strongly in this respect that one obvious area which calls for immediate action is the conclusion of an agreement banning the underground testing of nuclear weapons.\n176.\tWith the signing of the important Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex], the first real disarmament agreement in the post-war years has been achieved, for this Convention not only calls for the prohibition of all such weapons, but also for their destruction. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament now has before it similar initiatives to prohibit chemical weapons. It is our considered opinion that with regard to chemical weapons a similar approach to the one used in the Convention on biological weapons should be used, that is, the prohibition should be conceived comprehensively rather than selectively, and also the destruction of all existing chemical weapons should be required. When we say this we are not unmindful of the technical and scientific difficulties involved, but we cannot believe that these difficulties are beyond human ingenuity to solve.\n177.\tThere is, of course, always the need to keep the question of disarmament uppermost in the minds of the people. We hope the proposed World Disarmament Conference will help focus international attention and concern on one of mankind's most important problems. We also hope that all of the nuclear weapon Powers will be persuaded to join the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and make the contribution which only they can make.\n178.\tInternational trade and monetary reforms dominated economic discussions in the past year. More than ever the organic links between trade, development, finance and monetary reforms have been recognized. It is now clear that if progress is to be made on any of these fronts an interconnected and concerted international action will be required.\n179.\tThe third session of UNCTAD fell short of the immediate expectations of the developing countries, but its results were not altogether barren. Judged by the new ground it broke, by what it forced all of us to address ourselves to, and, finally, by the trend of thinking which it has set in motion, the session can be said to have marked some progress. Although the benefits may still be limited and other problems remain to be overcome, what has been accomplished with regard to the provision of preferential treatment by the industrialized countries for manufactured goods coming from developing countries is significant. Regrettably, it has not been possible to make similar progress on the primary commodity exports of developing countries.\n180.\tThat the problems facing the least developed among the developing countries should have merited special attention and that a special program of action should have been envisaged to help them are matters of satisfaction to my Government. Hie need to associate developing countries with the decision-making process in economic matters was also recognized adequately, and the establishment within the International Monetary Fund of the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues in connexion with monetary reforms is already one manifestation of this belated recognition. We hope that this recognition will go beyond merely associating the developing countries and will find reflection in the decisions that will eventually emerge.\n181.\tWe are now approaching the first over-all review of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Already the realization has dawned on us that we may not have succeeded in matching the International Development Strategy we have devised [resolution 2626 (XXV)] with an appropriate institutional arrangement that will enable us to carry it out. Often when we gather under the aegis of different international institutions we seem to develop a certain bias and tend to look at the development process from one limited angle or another. As we continue to address ourselves to the problems of development it is important that we pay as much attention to how best we can organize our efforts as we do to analyzing the problems themselves.\n182.\tThe concept of a global village has become more than a figure of speech; it is a reality today. It is not only that physical distances have shrunk; our problems have become common also. International co-operation in the solution of many of our problems is no longer a luxury but has become an obligation dictated by self-interest. Today no one is strong enough to go it alone; every State that contributes to such international co-operation stands to benefit from it.\n183.\tIt is in the lasting interest of States Members of the United Nations that they should now create an equitable international order, an order buttressed by a self-sustaining system of international co-operation, in which the interests of the strong and the weak will be taken equally into account. What is required in effect is to strengthen the United Nations, increase the scope of international cooperation already established under it and move forward with imagination and ingenuity to those areas which require further co-operation.\n184.\tIt is often suggested that the United Nations has become too big and too unwieldy to be used as an effective instrument for political action. It is also said that the admission of too many small States has diluted the authority of the United Nations. We cannot accept such premises for the improvement of the United Nations. If anything, there is more to be said for a greater participation of small States in international affairs. The Charter of the United Nations is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of States; it also reflects the reality of international life by conferring special powers on the permanent members of the Security Council. In the world of today all States have an equal stake in the maintenance of peace; the consequences of the disruption of peace would affect all equally. If reforms are to be made to strengthen the institutions of the United Nations these should certainly be directed towards more democratization and not towards more restrictions.\n185.\tIt seems to us particularly significant that while improving relations between themselves the big Powers recognize the need to strengthen the United Nations as an instrument for international co-operation and negotiation. Nothing would be more damaging to the international order that we hope to create than to rely on bilateral arrangements based on the outmoded concept of the balance of power. The fact that we have not been distinctly successful in completing the edifice of a system of international co-operation as envisaged in the Charter should not lead us to seek other arrangements which historically have proved to be unsuccessful. In fact, that should give us more reason to work with dedication and deliberate speed to complete the system.\n186.\tWe are entering a phase in which the need for new areas of international co-operation and new institutions is acutely felt. The immediate stability of the international community depends on the scope and speed with which we are able to establish this new order. In establishing new principles to guide the behavior of States and in creating new institutions and procedures for settling disputes before they erupt, we must continue to address ourselves with vigor and imagination to removing potential sources of conflicts.\n187.\tThe need to create an equitable system of international co-operation for the utilization of the resources of the sea and the control of environmental pollution hardly requires emphasis. In particular, we cannot for long leave unregulated the question of jurisdictional claims over the sea and the resources of the sea-bed without bringing on ourselves a host of problems. It seems to us that now is the time to move forward, before claims and counter-claims are advanced to the stage at which they can become sources of serious conflict.\n188. As the international community has become more interdependent, so have the means of communication. No country today can survive without air, postal, and telecommunications links. It is a matter of growing concern to the international community that some individuals and groups have sought to disrupt orderly international life. These perpetrators of violence have not hesitated to put the lives of scores of people in serious jeopardy and to destroy life when they cannot have their way.\n189. My Government condemns all such acts of violence directed against national leaders, diplomatic envoys, inter-national passengers and innocent civilians. All of us have such a high stake in orderly international life that we cannot fail to condemn them and take appropriate preventive action. It must be clear to all of us that if such violence continues no one is going to remain unaffected. Failure to take effective and prompt international action will breed further violence.\n190.\tMy delegation believes that the question of international terrorism should be properly defined and discussed in a correct context. We had misgivings about discussing this matter without giving it sufficient precision. We were seriously concerned that an ill-defined discussion could be used by some to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples for freedom and independence. It is common knowledge that the colonialist regimes in southern Africa very often refer to freedom fighters as terrorists. Nothing would give them more pleasure than to reintroduce confusion as to the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples for freedom and independence a legitimacy which has been recognized by the United Nations. Needless to say, these misgivings persist. Nevertheless we are ready to join in all constructive discussions of the problems posed by international terrorism.\n191.\tFinally, I should like to say that today more than ever the world needs the United Nations. Despite some of the criticisms often heard, the United Nations has been of great service to the international community. A better way to judge its usefulness would be to imagine how the world would have fared without it. What is required of us is to do our best to improve it as an instrument for international peace and co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first of all I wish to convey to you my congratulations on your election in the certainty that your wisdom and your qualities as a statesman and a student of the problems which affect the international political scene are guarantees that the tasks before us will lead to effective results to the satisfaction of all peoples of the world.\n117.\tAn outstanding thinker of the Antilles and foremost sociologist propounded the thesis that the moral progress of peoples runs in the opposite sense to the course of their material progress. That sociological concept applies to the successive periods of the history of civilization.\n118.\tIn the world of today we are witnessing technological and scientific progress of such dimensions that we could almost say that it has outstripped man's fantasy, which has always been governed by his tremendous imagination. Thus we have come today to the invention of destructive weapons which could wipe out the human race; and, similarly, with the arrival of man on the moon we can say that we have entered upon the stage of the domination of outer space.\n119.\tToday, almost everyone concedes that at this juncture in civilization, material progress, spurred by science, has changed the characteristics of a natural process in man that is to say, the structure of the individual and collective mentality.\n120.\tIt would be difficult to forecast how far nations can be carried by the undeniable, realistic postulate which suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between material progress and moral progress in society today.\n121.\tFrom those considerations we could reach the view, which has been repeated since ancient times, that truly man is his own worst enemy. Hence the idea of domination at the cost of destruction and war has still not disappeared.\n122.\tThe work done by the United Nations to achieve peace and eliminate the scourge of war, the events that have occurred and the actions that have been taken from the San Francisco Conference to the present day to avoid the spreading of wars beyond the areas of conflict leave no doubt about how exposed nations find themselves to ruin and the violence of a third world war, perhaps of nuclear dimensions, which would wipe out any vestiges of a society which was always in ferment but which in the depths of its being cherished a noble vocation for peace. Here again, this is a threat that we all view with trepidation, because, despite the years that have passed and the efforts that have been made, we have still not been able to avoid the international tensions which appear to be the major enemy to peace.\n123.\tThe picture that I have just sketched is, as we know, in no way encouraging, and it should not really be presented here by the delegation of a country small in territory such as ours; rather it should be presented by the great Powers, which inevitably govern the destinies of mankind. However, as we are fully aware that all States are equal, and as experience teaches us that ideas are the heritage of all mankind, we are repeating a concern which we know is shared by a large part of mankind.\n124.\tWe should add to the foregoing considerations that we are convinced that these facts alone are not the only cause of the abnormalities which exist in the international order.\n125.\tIt is possible that in the world of today there exists a specific causal divisive element which makes possible this imbalance between moral progress and material progress in the world in which we live. We are referring specifically to the crisis in law. Thus we see that the more we progress towards the development of legal standards, enshrined in treaties and conventions, the weaker and more ineffective they become in the enforcement of those norms, thus ensuring the necessary maintenance of peace and reasonable coexistence. Take, for example, the failure to observe treaties setting forth a lofty humanistic vision of man, specifically in international conflicts, as has occurred in the case of the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war, on inherent rights, on smuggling and the illicit traffic in drugs, international delinquency aggravated by the hijacking of aircraft and many other violations of the law.\n126.\tFrom these considerations we conclude that if such things are happening in the international community it would not be at all venturesome to assert that the obstacle which stands in the way of peace and the elimination of international tensions is, as we have already stated, the crisis in law.\n127.\tWe have recognized that this is not the sole cause of the anguish in which we, the peoples of the world, live, but we cannot deny that such a crisis has a great deal to do with the fact that viable solutions are not being found to the problems whose solutions are the direct responsibility of the States involved in a dispute, as well as of the United Nations, which is the repository of the most powerful machinery which we can count upon for the solution of such conflicts.\n128.\tIt is not incumbent upon us to spell out in terms of doctrine a policy of such magnitude in order to break the vicious circle in which we find ourselves confined. It is certainly up to us, however, to organize, to find a way out of the critical realities with which we are confronted today, and we could discover the way out if there were a meeting of the minds on the necessity to work out a system to restore confidence, without which no permanent peace is possible.\n129.\tDespite the conviction that this is a difficult task and that many paths will have to be smoothed in order to reach this system of security, to which reference has been made so many times by so many voices in this hall, it is equally certain that specific sacrifices are required which will test the real desire for peace which prevails in the world today.\n130.\tOne of the methods that my delegation considers would be effective would be the one referred to in resolution 2864 (XXVI), which empowers Member States to take positions on \\\"means of enhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations\\\". We are convinced that an enhancement of these methods would be a step forward towards the possibility of reaching a point where we could work out the system of security to which we have referred.\n131.\tBut we must recognize that the desired enhancement of the methods to improve the efficiency of the Security Council would require a revitalizing of certain fundamental instruments available to the Council. Accordingly, my Government stresses the criterion that the Charter should be revised in respect of the provisions on the right of veto.\n132.\tWe are absolutely certain that it will be impossible to increase the efficiency of the Security Council just so long as we do not remove from the Charter a privilege which is at odds with the very essence of democracy. We say this because, far from being a notable step forward in the features characteristic of our era, which is typified by its revolt against old structures; this privilege is in itself an archaic institution. Perhaps it was justified when the victorious Powers were laying the foundations of this world Organization and wished by the veto to rule out alternatives for international equilibrium.\n133.\tHowever, we would agree that the method should be attenuated in such a way that this exceptional right should be exercised only in circumstances in which we obviously face the alternative of a conflict that could endanger world peace.\n134.\tThe Dominican Republic, which has always been known for the support it has given to the predominance of human rights in our Organization, is firmly convinced that never before has our civilization been under a greater obligation to make freedom and dignity for man a reality. Accordingly we cannot possibly concede that States may infringe or make conditional the respect for and protection of the inherent rights of the human person. It is not difficult to understand that there can be no freedom where these rights are infringed.\n135.\tFor all of those reasons my country is opposed to acts of violence in all their forms of social upheaval; hence we reject the attacks which, like the one which took place recently in Munich, constitute acts of barbarism that are the \\\"fruit of the most savage form of terrorism\\\", as our Chief of State, H.E. Joaquin Balaguer stated. This is all the more true when by such acts innocent persons who are not involved in the motives that blindly lead people to take up arms and engage in destructive activities become the victims.\n136.\tIn a period of such tremendous progress, such as that which has been made in the field of human rights, we cannot close our eyes and remain indifferent to the recent tragic events which occurred in the emotion-torn Olympic Village. For this reason, my Government could not fail to give its support to the request for the inclusion in the agenda of item 92 concerning measures to prevent international terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardize fundamental freedoms, in the conviction that, in addition to energetic protests, there will emerge from this hall the necessary action to put an end to such horrendous acts.\n137.\tNor can we fail, on this occasion, to refer to the development process which is under way in the Dominican Republic today, in accordance with the plans that are being pressed forward by our constitutional Government with relentless vigor.\n138.\tWhile it is true that one of the reasons for the state of anxiety in which mankind is living today is a result of the crisis in law, it is equally true that the most effective way to deal with this situation is to obtain balanced development for all of our peoples. Hence, the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI, who said: \\\"Development is the new name of peace\\\". This message has reached all peoples with great conviction and force.\n139.\tAccordingly, at this time, my Government is deeply involved in the most thoroughgoing revolution' of our structures which was ever recorded in the history of Hispaniola, with the introduction and implementation of the Agrarian Code which sets up the machinery to hand over to the farmer the land that he cultivates and to take from over-greedy hands the principal sources of the wealth of the Republic.\n140.\tMy Government hopes that after having doubled the per capita income of our country after barely six years, we will be able in a few years to continue to develop our vast wealth of resources which heretofore has been practically unproductive, so that we can continue strengthening the soundness of our democratic institutions and uproot, once and for all, the causes that have led to such frequent upheavals as are recorded in the history of the Dominican Republic.\n141.\tAs another trend within this spirit of progress which pervades the Dominican Republic, we can point to the importance that my Government has attached to the conclusions that are summarized in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721, annex I, sect.2], a basic document of the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea, which was held in Santo Domingo from 5 to 9 June and which was attended by 13 Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean region.\n142.\tOn that occasion our attention was devoted not only to the problem of the exploitation of the resources of the sea, but also towards everything that is required to preserve the species as an inseparable aspect of the fundamental question of exploitation. Thus we were also able to \ncontribute to a subject matter which involves the human environment, a matter to which this Assembly is to devote special attention. We were trying thereby to take one more step forward in respect of the complicated problem of pollution and development.\n143.\tFor those reasons it would be most appropriate if we could succeed at this session in persuading the countries represented here to find concrete solutions while we prepare effectively to apply the principles already accepted under existing conventions on the problem of the contamination of the sea, which affects us all, aware as we are that we shall have to find adequate solutions, in view of the interrelationship between pollution and the whole process of the development of nations.\n144.\tThe importance and the dissimilarity of the items on the agenda of this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly explain the interest felt by the foremost leaders of the world in finding day by day solutions more in accordance with the reality in which we live. Hence, after objective analysis of the importance of youth today and, above all, noting the fact that more than half the world is less than 25 years of age, the United Nations has endorsed this categorical statement: \\\"The young generation is a segment of the population whose needs are growing day by day and whose contribution to development is vital.\\\"\n145.\tAs we are all aware of the responsibility that devolves upon us within this Organization to exert our efforts to work out national development plans, there is nothing more urgent for the full discharge of this duty than to incorporate youth in the serious tasks of renewal and development. Therefore we view with great satisfaction the fact that we are going to discuss the question of youth, its education, its principles, its needs, its active participation in development and international co-operation.\n146.\tWe have seen with great hope how in this past decade youth has begun to play a decisive role in the inevitable process of transformation of our social, political and economic structures and how efficiently it is carrying out its great responsibilities.\n147.\tWe can assert that we are witnessing today a phenomenon characteristic of this century and that the time will come when the new generations will have to inherit this world Organization, at which time we are sure they will champion the most cherished hopes of past generations.\n148.\tThe coming generations recognize that the United Nations is the repository of the principles and ideals for which they are fighting so dynamically and wisely in order to advance the ideas of the new era. Therefore we will advocate a re-examination of policies concerning youth, in each country's national plans, so that the organizations of the world system can redouble their efforts towards the creation of new projects that will satisfy their just desires for progress.\n149.\tIn his Encyclical Letter Populorum Progressio His Holiness Pope Paul VI summarized the overriding importance of development in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of progress when he said:\n\\\"All of you who have heard the appeal of suffering peoples, all of you who are working to answer their cries, you are the apostles of a development which is good and genuine, which is not wealth that is self-centered and sought for its own sake, but rather an economy which is put at the service of man, the bread which is daily distributed to all, as a source of brotherhood and a sign of providence.\\\"\n150.\tAllow me to conclude my statement this afternoon by adopting for ourselves this other appeal by Pope Paul VI, contained in the same Encyclical:\n\\\"Government officials, it is your concern to mobilize your peoples to form a more effective world solidarity, and, above all, to make them accept the necessary taxes on their luxuries and their wasteful expenditures in order to bring about development and to save the peace. Delegates to international organizations, it depends on you to see that the dangerous and futile rivalry of powers should give place to collaboration which is friendly, peaceful and free of vested interests, in order to achieve a responsible development of mankind, in which all men will have an opportunity to find their fulfillment.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to congratulate you, Sir, upon your assumption of the duties of President of the General Assembly and to assure you of the co-operation of my Government and delegation. We are confident that you will fulfill your difficult duties with the same distinction that you have devoted to other duties in the service of your country.\n116.\tAllow me also, Mr. President, to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your predecessor, the distinguished Foreign Minister of Indonesia Mr. Adam Malik. We in Oman will always remember that it was under his presidency that Oman became a Member of the United Nations.\n117.\tLooking back over the events of the past year, we may find much to be encouraged about in our quest for peace and international harmony, although we must at the same time point out the problems that we face and on which no progress has yet been achieved.\n118.\tOn the positive side we must point to the detente and rapprochement that has been achieved by the major Powers. The arms limitation agreements already achieved at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and in Moscow go part of the way to achieving the objective of placing a real limitation on arms of mass destruction. As a representative of an under-developed country, we find that the progress that has been achieved in this field has been encouraging, and we can only hope for further progress, for it is indeed deplorable that 7.2 per cent of the world's gross national product is being spent on armaments and highly sophisticated methods of mass destruction. We feel that these resources could be better spent on aid to the underdeveloped countries of the world, for it is only this course of action that can assure peace, security and harmony among the nations and the peoples of this planet.\n119.\tMy Government is also highly gratified to hear of the detente and rapprochement that has been occurring between other nations that have so very recently been involved in futile and fruitless confrontations. It is our deep hope that these nations will not stop at just ceasing their previous confrontations but will continue to achieve lasting peace, brotherhood and co-operation in all fields with their erstwhile adversaries.\n120.\tWe particularly welcome the agreement that has been achieved between the Governments of India and Pakistan. These two countries are very close to us not only geographically and economically but also historically. It is our sincere hope that these great and peace-loving countries will progress from partial agreements to full accord on a permanent and just peace and or mutual co-operation in all fields. It is also our sincere hope that any such peace will not reflect the weight of military conquest or victory, for it is in this area more than anywhere else that true statesmanship requires foresight and magnanimity.\n121.\tWe also welcome the agreements that have been achieved between the divided countries of this world, namely, West and East Germany and North and South Korea. Their decision to solve their problems by peaceful means requires our highest support, for their decisions comply with the spirit of our Charter. It is our sincere hope that these States will persevere in the path that they have chosen and that they will soon join us as full Members of this Organization.\n122.\tThe further consolidation and widening of the European Economic Community that has occurred during the course of this past year is also welcome to us. It is our profound hope that the new Europe will be a force for peace among nations and that it will continue to expand its generous aid to under-developed countries.\n123.\tI now turn to an area of the world that is of great interest to us. I refer to the Gulf area. My Government's policy in this highly important and strategic area is based upon our profound desire that there should be in this area the basic and fundamental stability in which the nations of the area can work for progress and development in the economic, social and political spheres.\n124.\tUnder the reign of my enlightened Sovereign, His Majesty Sultan Qabus, we in Oman have been able to safeguard just such a stability and remarkable strides towards progress have already been achieved by my country and people. Schools and health clinics have been set up, and Oman has already begun a network of roads to connect its various parts.\n125.\tPorts and telecommunications facilities are now almost completed and many, many projects are now under construction.\n126.\tWe realize that we have only just begun the task of laying the basic infrastructure for further economic and social development and we realize that the road ahead will be both long and arduous. But we, the Government and people of Oman, have freely resolved to embark and to persevere on the course of action we have freely chosen. My Government and people will also welcome all economic and technical assistance and investment by foreign States and commercial enterprises, as long as they are in the interest of our economic development as a free and sovereign country. My Government particularly welcomes economic and technical assistance from international organizations, especially the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies, which have such a wealth of experience and know-how.\n127.\tIn this context my Government and people will not allow various foreign elements to disrupt the framework of peace, stability and progress that we have freely chosen. These elements seek to divert us and our limited resources from this noble and enlightened path and they hope thereby to retard our economic and social development. We will resist these foreign elements which seek to interfere in our internal affairs and which have openly and shamelessly declared their aggressive and seditious intentions. They harbor nothing but enmity toward our country and people and never cease to slander us. We in Oman will not interfere in the internal affairs of another State. By the same token, we will not stand idly by while another State or various alien elements interfere in our internal affairs.\u2003\n128.\tMy Government's policy with regard to the situation in South Africa is based upon our complete support of the principle of self-determination of African peoples and of our total rejection of the policies of apartheid and racism practiced by the regime in South Africa. We support the rights of the African people struggling for freedom and independence.\n129.\tI would now like to turn to the situation in the Middle East. The tragic events and continuing crisis in the Middle East impose a special responsibility upon this Organization and it is our profound hope that this year the Members of this body and the members of the Security Council will be able to resolve and enforce a just and permanent peace, for the present crisis in the Middle East poses the greatest threat to world peace and international security and, if you will allow me to add, to the efficacy and credibility of this noble Organization.\n130.\tWe believe that no solution to the Middle East crisis can be just or permanent that does not deal with the heart of the situation and its basic causes. The forcible expulsion of the Palestinian nation from their land, and the land of their ancestors, and the creation of an alien racist State that prides itself on its religious exclusivity constitute one of the most tragic and immoral crimes of this century. It was a crime and a blunder that the United Nations has a special responsibility to correct. No solution to the Middle East crisis can be just or permanent that condones and perpetuates the relegation of the Palestinian people to the status of refugees, living on international charity and deprived of their most basic human rights and of their national sovereignty.\n131.\tIsrael is the source of terrorism in the Middle East area. How else can we interpret the daily acts of aggression against Lebanon, Syria and Jordan? How else can we interpret the murder of innocent women, children, and the aged and the use of poison gas and napalm by the Israelis? Is this not terrorism?\n132.\tWe believe that no solution to the Middle East crisis can be just or permanent that condones and perpetuates the acquisition and annexation of territory by the use or threat of force, or as the Zionists euphemistically call it, \\\"creating facts\\\". Our belief is based not only upon elementary morality but also upon the principles of our Charter and of the most basic tenets of international law.\n133.\tWe believe that no solution can be just or permanent that condones and perpetuates the annexation of Arab Jerusalem by a Zionist aggressor. To allow the annexation of the city of peace, the holy city of three major religions, by the Zionists would be an act of eternal desecration of that great city.\n134.\tIn this connexion I would now like to appeal to the major Powers of this world to work in the United Nations and outside it for a permanent peace in the Middle East based upon justice. These Powers have often in the past pursued a policy in the area based upon their own strategic and economic interests or upon the wishes of vested interests consisting of vocal and often violent minorities in their own countries. What is required in the Middle East today is a policy in the wider interests of a permanent and just peace in compliance with the letter and the spirit of our Charter and of international law.\n135.\tIt has been an honor and a privilege to have had this opportunity on behalf of Oman to address the General Assembly of the United Nations, which meets now at a delicate and complex time. The nations of the world hope that we will be able to establish a fundamental framework for peace and international harmony. I thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this opportunity to address the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "Comrade President, first of all I should like on behalf of the\tdelegation of the Mongolian People's Republic to offer you our warm congratulations on your election to the lofty post of President of the present session of the General Assembly and to wish you great success in carrying out your\nresponsible duties. Your election is evidence of the general\nrecognition of the great effort which socialist Poland is\ncontributing to the improvement of the situation in Europe\nand the strengthening of peace and international security.\n98. My delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations, Mr. Waldheim, and wishes him every\nI success in carrying out the difficult but noble tasks\nentrusted to him in working for the establishment of universal security and the strengthening of the United Nations as the main instrument for the maintenance of peace.\n99.\tThe present session of the General Assembly is beginning its work at a time when the world is witnessing positive progress towards detente and the strengthening of the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation among States. This positive development in international life is the result primarily of a deep and irreversible change in the general alignment of forces which is promoting the cause of peace, national independence and the social progress of peoples.\n100.\tThe consistent and purposeful policy of peace pursued by the countries of the socialist community and vigorous activities of all peace-loving, anti-imperialist and democratic forces are a determining factor in this improvement in the world political climate. Those States which take due account of present political realities in carrying on their international activities are also making their contribution.\n101.\tThe principle of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems is gaining increasing recognition as a generally accepted norm of contemporary international life. It is reflected in a spirit of better mutual understanding, good-neighborliness and business-like co-operation be-tween States.\n102.\tWe consider that the outcome of the Soviet- American summit meeting, the entry into force of the treaties between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  and the four Power agreement on West Berlin,  and the signing in December 1971 of the celebrated agreements between the German Democratic Republic, on the one hand, and the Federal Republic of Germany and the West Berlin Senate, on the other, can be viewed as among the most important international events which clearly reflect the present trend towards detente.\n103.\tThe Government of the Mongolian. People's Republic considers that these events are in the long-term interests of the peoples of the world.\n104.\tHowever, there is no room for complacency. There still exist forces which are unfavorably disposed to international detente, in particular, to progress towards agreement on the crucial issues of our time and an improvement in mutual relations between States, and to the successes achieved by peoples in their struggle for freedom, national independence and social progress.\n105.\tThe present international situation is complex and unstable and presents for the world community and, especially, the United Nations, the urgent task of increasing and making more effective the efforts aimed at maintaining and strengthening international peace and security and averting the threat of a thermo-nuclear war.\n106.\tIt is for these reasons that Mongolia considers, as does the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations, that the problem of strengthening inter-national security should become the main subject for consideration at the present session of the General Assembly. The discussion of this urgent problem should reveal the root-causes of the perpetuation of the abnormal conditions prevailing in the world and once again draw general attention to the urgent necessity for the immediate elimination of hotbeds of war and crisis situations in various parts of the world. It is no secret that the explosive situations in one part of the world or another are due to the violation by certain States Members of the United Nations of the principle of the Charter enjoining States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other State.\n107.\tIn this connexion, the Mongolian delegation would like to draw special attention to the timeliness and great practical significance of the item entitled \\\"Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons\\\" [item 25] proposed by the Soviet Government for consideration at the current session of the General Assembly [A/8793].\n108.\tWe consider that in the present circumstances the consistent application of the principle of non-use of force will undoubtedly contribute to the elimination of existing armed conflicts and the creation of more favorable conditions for ending the arms race and bringing about general and complete disarmament.\n109.\tThe Mongolian delegation fully endorses the basic provisions of the draft resolution submitted yesterday by the Soviet delegation [A/L.676] for consideration at the present session concerning the renunciation by States Members of the United Nations of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons. The adoption and practical implementation of such a resolution would be an important contribution to the carrying out of one of the basic provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].\n110.\tIt is our view that the immediate halting of United States aggression in Indochina and the elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression in the Middle East are essential preconditions for the strengthening of universal peace and security.\n111.\tThe United States Government has not only failed to put an end to its neo-colonialist war against Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos but is escalating it by renewing the barbarous bombing of vital centres, dams and dikes in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and by blockading its ports and other lines of communication. Under cover of the much-publicized troops withdrawals from South Viet-Nam, the United States is, in fact, building up its armed strength and increasing its military presence in Indo-China.\n112.\tThe people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic have consistently supported the just struggle of the heioic Viet-Namese people and the patriotic forces of Cambodia and Laos. They have always considered that the problem of Indo-China should be settled by peaceful means on the basis of the unconditional recog-nition of the inalienable right of the peoples of those countries to self-determination and independent devel-opment without outside interference. The United States must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from South Viet-Nam and put an end to the \\\"Viet- Namization\\\" of the war. It must discontinue its support of the anti-popular regime in Saigon and recognize the political realities of the situation in South Viet-Nam. This will be a decisive condition for the settlement of the problem of Viet-Nam on the basis of the well-known and constructive proposals of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.\n113.\tThe Mongolian Government considers that the perpetuation of the crises in the Middle East constitutes a growing threat to universal peace and security. It is common knowledge that the basic cause of the continuing tension in that region lies in Tel Aviv's stubborn refusal to carry out the Security Council resolutions and, in particular, to withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories. Israel's recent acts of aggression against a number of Arab countries serve as a stern reminder of the real danger of a new outbreak of fighting. Israeli ruling circles have dared to throw down an open challenge to world public opinion because they can rely on the growing financial and military support of the United States.\n114.\tIt is essential to make new efforts to implement the well-known Security Council resolution 242 (1967), and to reactivate for that purpose the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It must not be forgotten that the united actions of all peace-loving forces are of decisive significance for the just and peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. In this connexion, we think that the United Nations must be more active in seeking out ways and means of utilizing all positive factors which may contribute towards such a settlement.\n115.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic considers that the establishment of regional security systems will undoubtedly be an important factor in the safeguarding of universal peace and security.\n116.\tIn the present - circumstances, collective efforts towards that goal may bring practical results. Evidence of this may be found, in particular, in the positive progress achieved in Europe, which may, subject to further favor-able development, provide the basis for lasting peace and co-operation in Europe. The lessons of two devastating world wars have taught us that the international situation in Europe has a very direct bearing on the interests of the peoples of other continents, too. For this reason we welcome any step towards improving the political climate in Europe.\n117.\tIn this connexion, our delegation is gratified to note the normalization of relations between the Polish People's\u2003Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, on the basis of the recognition of the Munich Agreement as invalid from the outset, will undoubtedly serve to improve the general European situation.\n118.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic supports the idea of convening an all-European conference on security and co-operation. The holding of such a conference will be an important milestone in the efforts to establish a collective security system in that part of the world.\n119.\tAs events have shown, Asia is a continent badly in need of a stable and lasting peace.\n120.\tOur Government responds actively to, and supports, any constructive proposals and specific measures designed to eliminate hotbeds of tension and promote the development of good-neighborly relations between all the countries of Asia.\n121.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic has always sup-ported the idea of establishing a collective security system in Asia. It may be said that recently, when the Governments of many Asian countries have been taking a new look at, and critically assessing, their positions on the problems of lasting peace and security in that huge region, increasing interest has been shown in the idea of collective security. We are in favor of the establishment of such a security system, which would be based strictly on the principles of the Charter and would embrace all States of the continent regardless of their different social systems.\n122.\tOur delegation is pleased to note certain progress which is currently being made in relations between Asian States towards the creation of a stronger spirit of realism and mutual understanding.\n123.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic has welcomed the positive outcome of the meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Pakistan at Simla, which has cleared the way for the normalization and improvement of the situation in the Indian subcontinent. We hope that the results of that meeting will be consolidated by new positive measures in the interests of strengthening peaceful conditions on the subcontinent and in Asia.\n124.\tThe settlement of the Korean question in full accord with the basic interests of the Korean people is of considerable importance for the strengthening of peace and security in Asia. The sine qua non of this settlement still is the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. The United Nations must work towards the positive solution of the problem of the peaceful unification of Korea. That is why Mongolia became a sponsor of a new item entitled \\\"Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea\\\" which was proposed for consideration at the current session of the General Assembly [A/8752/AddA].\n125.\tThe postponement of the consideration of this important item once again deprives the United Nations of the opportunity to have a business-like discussion on the question with a view to the normalization of the situation in the Korean peninsula in the interests of strengthening peace and security in Asia.\n126.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic will continue to support the policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the settlement of the Korean problem in accordance with the national interests of the Korean people.\n127.\tThe achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict international control, and in particular nuclear disarmament, is a decisive material and moral precondition for the establishment of universal peace and security on earth and the banishment of war from the life of human society.\n128.\tIn this connexion, the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes with great satisfaction the signing at Moscow on 26 May 1972 by the Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America of the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with Respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. The signing of these agreements represents real progress towards a solution of the problem of the limitation of the arms race. They can open up great possibilities for agreement on further measures in a vital aspect of arms limitation and disarmament, namely the banning of nuclear weapons.\n129.\tIt seems to us perfectly natural that other nuclear Powers, too, should display some initiative of their own and attempt to consolidate and multiply the results of these measures which, although the first in the field, are of far-reaching importance. The interests of all humanity demand that they do so.\n130.\tThe position of our Government on the convening of a world disarmament conference has been set forth in detail in its reply to the Secretary-General's letter [see A/8817]. Recognizing the great importance of such a conference, our Government is in favor of an immediate start being made on practical preparations for the convening of the conference in the near future. It is our view that the present session of the General Assembly should, in fact, set in motion preparations for this forum, at which all the States of the world will take part in discussion of the most crucial issue of our time-general and complete disarmament.\n131.\tIn addition, efforts must be made to reach early agreement on such pressing problems as the cessation of all forms of nuclear weapons tests by all States, the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons, and so on.\n132.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, together with eight other socialist countries, has sponsored a draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction [see A/8818, annex B, sect. 5]. Like the other sponsors, we advocate the immediate and complete prohibition of all forms of chemical weapons. The overwhelming majority of States supports this position. Our delegation will set forth in detail its position on this and other disarmament questions when they are taken up specifically.\n133.\tColonial domination and racial oppression pose a constant threat to international peace and universal security. The United Nations must take effective steps to eliminate colonialism and racism in all their forms and manifestations.\n134.\tThe people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic express their solidarity and unflagging support for the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Namibia and Zimbabwe in their heroic struggle to cast off colonialism and racial oppression and achieve national self-determination and independence. The national liberation movement is winning new victories, but the imperialist Powers are stubbornly resisting the final over-throw of colonialism.\n135.\tThe Mongolian peoples expresses its zealous solidarity with all oppressed peoples in their just struggle for freedom and independence. Our Government maintains that the decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning southern Africa should be implemented by all States without exception.\n136.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic urges the further development and strengthening of international economic ties and co-operation on the basis of equal rights, mutual advantage, justice and respect for the lawful interests and needs of all countries, in particular developing countries.\n137.\tIt should be stressed at this point that recognition of the existence of two world economic systems would serve as a sound basis for the normal development of inter-national economic relations.\n138.\tAs the third session of UNCTAD has shown, the main reasons for the extremely abnormal situation in the world economy and in economic relations are the exploitation of the under-developed countries, and the discrimination practiced by the Western Powers in international economic relations and their stubborn resistance to the introduction of just and democratic principles and methods in international economic life. Consequently, the appropriate United Nations bodies, above all the Economic and Social Council, must improve their effectiveness and get down to the job of finding ways and means of normalizing world economic relations on a just and democratic basis.\n139.\tThere is, I think, no need to dwell on the weight which we attach to the role and activities of the United Nations as an important instrument for the strengthening of international peace and security. Here we should like to stress once again that the United Nations is still not making full use of the possibilities provided in the Charter. Our delegation considers that the strict observance of the Charter would enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations and promote the strengthening of international security. The difficulty lies, not in the obsolescence or weakness of the Charter, but in the fact that certain States Members of the United Nations disregard and refuse to implement its most important provisions. Our position of principle on this question remains unchanged. We are against any attempt to revise the basic provisions of the Charter, no matter what the pretext.\n140.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic advocates the achievement of true universality in the\nUnited Nations, which would play an important part in enhancing its role and effectiveness. The admission of the two German States to the United Nations would undoubtedly be an important step towards achieving genuine universality and would put an end to discrimination against the German Democratic Republic, a State which is doing much to strengthen peace and develop international co-operation in Europe and throughout the world. In this connexion, we feel that the first step to be taken towards ending the discrimination against the German Democratic Republic is to grant it the status of permanent observer at United Nations Headquarters, as was done in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n141.\tOur delegation cannot help expressing its regret, too, at the unjust treatment of a young Asian State whose 75 million people recently emerged victorious from a hard and just struggle for freedom and national independence. In our view, the founding of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is a historic fact recognized by the overwhelming majority of members of the international community. In present circumstances, when the majority of Members wish to see the United Nations become a truly universal body and wish to free it from the burden of past errors, opposition to the admission of this sovereign State to the United Nations is particularly distasteful. Obstructive tactics of this kind are not conducive to the normalization of the situation in the Indian subcontinent and damage the prestige of the United Nations. We are confident that the People's Republic of Bangladesh will take its lawful seat in this world organization.\n142.\tIt is of particular importance to increase the effectiveness of the Security Council, which bears the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace. In this connexion, measures should be taken to improve the methods of work of that body, making use of the possibilities provided in the Charter. We are of the opinion that the periodic meetings of the Security Council should be held more often, in keeping with Article 28 of the Charter, so that it could give fuller consideration to the pressing problems of international life, including questions connected with the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security.\n143.\tIt is also necessary to resolve the question of the speedy elaboration of principles and guidelines for the effective functioning of the Security Council in the field of peace-keeping operations.\n144.\tThe Mongolian people views the maintenance and strengthening of universal peace as an important external condition for the successful building of a new life and the solution of the difficult problems of socialist development in our country. In close union with fraternal socialist countries and in co-operation with peace-loving and democratic forces, the Mongolian People's Republic is striving to further the noble aim of strengthening peace, mutual understanding and co-operation between peoples.\n145.\tOur delegation hopes that the present session of the General Assembly will make its contribution to the solution of the urgent problems of international life with a view to strengthening mutual understanding and co-operation between States and consolidating the peace and security of peoples. Allow me to assure you, Mr. President, that the constructive efforts of the United Nations towards those goals will enjoy the full support of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic.\n146.\tMr. AL-SOWEIDI (United Arab Emirates): ** Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I extend to you the congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session. Poland and the Arab nation, of which my country is an integral part, have had for many years the closest and most friendly relations.\n147.\tMay I also express our appreciation for the brilliant manner in which Mr. Adam Malik, the illustrious Foreign Minister of Indonesia, presided over the previous session.\n148.\tWe also wish our new Secretary-General success in the discharge of his important responsibilities.\n149.\tIn this first year of our independence, our main task has been to find our proper place and role in the international community, a place and role determined by our history, geographical position, economic resources and, above all, by the desires and expectations of our people.\n150.\tOur Union is open to all Arab countries in the Gulf area and elsewhere. We are firm believers in the ideal of Arab unity and we hope that our example will reverse the trend towards fragmentation and division in the Arab world and herald a new era in which the Arab nation will be able to play a beneficent and significant role in world affairs which its history, its culture and its resources entitle it to play. We have fully identified ourselves with the fundamental positions of principle taken by the Arab countries within the framework of the League of Arab States, of which we are now a member.\n151.\tThe question euphemistically called \\\"The situation in the Middle East\\\" [item 21], and which I would prefer to call by its proper name \\\"the question of Palestine\\\", remains the central national issue for the Arab people. Essentially it is the plight of a people dispossessed and driven out of its homeland by a colonialist armed invasion. So long as the people of Palestine are denied their fundamental rights in their ancestral homeland, there can be no settlement, nor peace in the Middle East.\n152.\tA good deal has been said recently about the problem of terrorism. Israel, of course, has been attempting to derive some propaganda advantage and to exploit a very serious human problem, so characteristic of our times, to achieve narrow and selfish political gains and to set the stage for further territorial acquisitions and the fulfillment of its well-known expansionist aims. I am certain that the General Assembly will not be diverted by these crude and obvious maneuvers from its duty to discuss the issue with the sense of sober responsibility it deserves.\n153.\tThe people of Palestine have waited in vain for a quarter of a century for some redress of the grave injustice inflicted upon them. The international community, whose collective will this Organization represents, has seemed to be oblivious to their plight and through its inaction, over the years, has implicitly acquiesced in Israel's aggression. Israel was founded and has maintained itself by the systematic and ruthless practice of terror: terror which drove the majority of Palestinians out of their homeland, terror which deprived them of freedom and dignity, terror which made the remnants who stayed behind second-class citizens in their own country, terror which pursued them in their unhappy exile, in their wretched refugee camps, and slaughtered them by the hundreds. We do not and cannot condone the killing of innocent people, but how can we equate the desperate acts of a few individuals driven by \\\"misery, frustration, grievance and despair\\\", to quote the Secretary-General's words [see A/8791/Add.l], with the brutal, deliberate and cold-blooded acts of indiscriminate killing perpetrated by the armed forces of a State? Let us not make the mistake of thinking that these are acts of revenge; they are concerned primarily with the achievement of long-standing strategic and political aims.\n154.\tOur geographical position in the Gulf has given us a vital interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in that important economic and strategic area of the world. We have endeavored to establish the closest relations with our neighbors. It is our firm belief that the peace and stability of the Gulf region can be maintained only with the co-operation of its States and with their respect for one another's independence and territorial integrity. Whatever disputes or differences exist at present or may arise in the future can and must be resolved by peaceful means and in a manner that will recognize and preserve the legitimate rights of all parties concerned without prejudice to their basic national interests. We are ready now, as we have always been, to co-operate with our neighbors to create a climate of understanding and harmony, which is essential for the peace and progress of the region and the welfare of all its people. The peace and security of the Gulf will be greatly enhanced by making the Indian Ocean region a zone of peace. We support the resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on this question [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and will welcome any further action at this session to ensure its implementation.\n155.\tWe are meeting at a time of rapid and sometimes dramatic change in the world situation. There have been unmistakable and welcome signs of a detente among the great Powers, a development of great importance in view of the fact that under the Charter these States have a primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is our hope that this is the beginning of an irreversible trend towards a greater degree of genuine international co-operation and not merely a temporary interruption in the cold war. Thus, on the central problem of war and peace we are entitled to express some cautious optimism. There are certainly some clear and concrete grounds for such optimism: the agreement on the partial limitation of strategic weapons, the ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland, the four-Power agreement on Berlin and the understanding reached between the two Governments of Korea, which may lead to the unification of that country. These encouraging developments have paradoxically given rise to some anxiety among the smaller countries. There is a feeling that the reduction of tensions among the great Powers may lead to the imposition of solutions to international problems that will ignore the desires and interests of other countries, especially those directly concerned. We hope that these fears are un-founded.\n156.\tAs we look at the agenda of this session, we still see some of the problems which have been dealt with by this Organization since its inception, such as colonialism and apartheid. A genocidal war is being waged against the African people who are struggling to free themselves from colonial domination. The racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to flout the will of the international community, encouraged by their undiminished trade with their Western trading partners and the continued flow of investments from abroad.\n157.\tIn their meeting held in Cairo earlier this month, the Arab Foreign Ministers issued a declaration on South East Asia affirming the solidarity of the Arab States with the peoples of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos in their struggle for national liberation and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from their lands. The declaration also condemned the aggression to which those countries have been subjected.\n158.\tIt will be unnecessary for me to dwell upon the serious economic problems facing the developing countries and the failure of all attempts to narrow the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. Perhaps nowhere is the tendency of certain advanced countries to take decisions affecting others more pronounced than it is in economic matters. Problems relating to the international monetary system and trade are discussed and dealt with by the major Powers without much concern for the vital interests of the developing countries. The third session of UNCTAD revealed the problem facing' the developing countries in all its painful dimensions. It is obvious that the developing countries have to strengthen and expand the co-operation among themselves and that they should shift their emphasis from exhortations addressed to the developed countries, which have largely fallen on deaf ears, to the greater possibilities of cooperation among themselves.\n159.\tWe have established a development fund with an initial capital of over $100 million to assist the countries of the region in their plans of development. Over and above this, we are also ready to contribute, within the limits of our means, to the various international and regional development activities undertaken by the United Nations and its specialized agencies.\n160.\tThere is undoubtedly a close link between the problems of development and disarmament. If only a fraction of the billions being squandered on the arms race were diverted to the urgent needs of the developing countries, then the whole depressing picture which con-fronts us today would be transformed beyond recognition. For this reason we support the convening of an inter-national conference on disarmament, with a view to the reduction and ultimate elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.\n161.\tAn event of great importance this year has been the adoption of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and the machinery being established to put into effect the principles and aims of that Declaration.\n162.\tI finally come to the question of the United Nations and the strengthening of its role and efficacy. This has always been a major concern of the smaller countries, such as my own. It stems from the belief that only through the United Nations can we translate into living reality the principles and ideals which bind us together. But it would be idle to pretend that the United Nations is not now, and has not been for some years, passing through a period of decline. The Organization has been purposely and rigorously prevented from playing any role in some crucial international problems. The United Nations has been rendered virtually powerless, through the obstruction of certain great Powers, to secure the implementation of its resolutions on Palestine, the Middle East, apartheid and colonialism. But we must first of all recognize that there are certain inherent weaknesses in the Charter itself. The Charter is, after all, a document which was drawn up before the advent of the nuclear age when a vast number of countries were still under foreign rule.\n163.\tThe Charter is also based on two basic assumptions which have been largely overtaken by the spectacular developments of the last quarter of a century. The two assumptions are that the hegemony of the great Powers will always be accepted as a permanent fact of international life and that the great Powers will, more often than not, act together to deal with major international problems. How-ever, in spite of its structural defects and the invalidity of its basic assumptions, the Charter is flexible enough to enable us to transform it into an effective instrument of the international order which we envisage for the future.\n164.\tAs a token of our faith in the United Nations and confidence in its future, my Government has decided to respond favorably to the appeal of the Secretary-General and make a contribution which we hope will help to alleviate the financial difficulties facing the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "A country jealous of its independence and sovereignty, achieved at the cost of the blood of the flower of its youth; a nation living in symbiosis for thousands of years, proud of its liberation and cohesiveness in spite of the nefarious actions of those who have imported barbaric systems repugnant to the conscience of mankind; a determined people fighting at the side of other revolutionary peoples in a relentless struggle against under-development and injustice in all its forms; a people that has always fought to bring about the triumph of the noble ideals of the Charter; an authority based on democratic centralism capable of ensuring the security of both nationals and foreigners; a people united and engaged in an irreversible revolution which began on 28 November 1966 thanks to its wise guide and well-loved chief, Colonel Michel Micombero this is today the glory and honor of the Republic of Burundi and the pride of its inhabitants.\n2.\tIt is on behalf of that Republic that from this lofty rostrum I have the honor of conveying to the President my warmest congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. He may be assured that my delegation will be at his side and support him in his noble and lofty task of serving faithfully and indefatigably the interests of the whole international community. We are certain that the objectives of our Organization will ultimately be achieved, thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of the various world personalities who devote body and soul to this task. The President is one of those, and it is precisely for this reason that he has been elected to preside over the General Assembly. His eminent political attributes and diplomatic qualities, his expertise in international questions, and his personality which transcends the limits of his own country a personality which has long since made its mark on the international scene-his experience, competence and integrity constitute, we are sure, an earnest of the success of this Assembly session. As citizen of a country Poland which has suffered from foreign aggression, we are sure that he will be all the more concerned about the problems of aggression against the independent countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere.\n3.\tAt this particular stage in history, when certain Powers are doing everything they can to sow subversion in the less-favored countries, fomenting division among citizens of the same country and also promoting foreign aggression, it is a great pleasure for us to have such an eminent personality as he presiding over this session, backed up by the members of the General Committee, who together make up such a great team. It is for this reason that we are confident that this Assembly session will be crowned with success, and that we greet him with such enthusiasm.\n4.\tMay I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who throughout last year ceaselessly strove for world peace and international security.\n5.\tI should also like to thank and congratulate most sincerely Mr. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose competence, devotion and probity are a credit to the Organization. Since his election to his high office a year ago Mr. Waldheim has devoted all his energies to the safeguarding of peace and to the search for understanding among peoples. Let him find in this the sincere expression of well deserved gratitude on the part of the Government of the Republic of Burundi.\n6.\tOn 26 June 1945, many of the nations represented here today signed the Charter of the United Nations at San Francisco. Our country was not yet independent, but it was no less appreciative of the principles contained in that Charter. That is why, on 18 September 1962, precisely 79 days after its liberation, the Burundi people wholeheartedly adhered to the United Nations. In that way my Government and country demonstrated their determination to struggle for the safeguarding and success of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n7.\tBurundi, in joining this Organization, was thereby taking an oath that it would henceforth spare no effort to maintain international peace and security and to promote development among nations and friendly relations based on the principle of the equal rights of peoples and their right to guide their own destinies and to take all other measures which might consolidate world peace and bring about  international co-operation through the solution of international problems in the economic, social, technical and humanitarian fields.\n8.\tIt behooves us to note that today, 10 years after becoming a Member of the United Nations, Burundi has always acted consistently with the principles to which it solemnly subscribed.\n9.\tAll nations represented here may derive gratification from the climate of understanding which has made it possible to avoid new conflicts among States. The world today may take pleasure at the fruitful talks which have been held between the People's Republic of China and the United States, on the one hand, and the United States and the Soviet Union on the other hand. The visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to China, the talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea bode well for the unity of divided nations and for peace in Asia. This climate of detente, so favorable to the search for peace and co-operation, is a direct consequence of the admission last year of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.\n10.\tThe friendly meetings and dialog between the leaders of nations and the world are, we are certain, a guarantee of international peace and security, as well as of the unity of the great human family. It is therefore to be hoped that such meetings will take place regularly and periodically. Although our Organization has registered striking successes, we must express our regret at the fact that the worst hotbeds of conflict which constitute a permanent threat to international peace and security still persist and threaten to grow even worse. I would mention particularly the Far East and the Middle East conflicts, and the situation in the Territories under apartheid or the anachronistic colonialism of Portugal.\n11.\tOnce again the Republic of Burundi appeals most urgently to international opinion, particularly to those responsible for the tragedy which has been going on in Viet-Nam for almost 30 years now, to see to it that those deliberate and organized massacres committed against an innocent people cease immediately. These massacres have been repeatedly denounced by many representatives from all continents.\n12.\tI, in turn, associate myself with them in asking that the 1954 Geneva Agreements be scrupulously observed and that the foreign troops of aggression be totally withdrawn from Vietnamese territory to enable the people of Viet-Nam itself, as a free nation, to settle its own affairs. For its part, the Republic of Burundi considers this to be the only acceptable solution dictated by common sense, because this war benefits neither the aggressor nor the Vietnamese people, but constitutes a crime against humanity and an unprecedented waste. This state of affairs, moreover, seriously jeopardizes the prestige of our Organization, and prevents it from effectively fulfilling its original and ultimate mission of protecting future generations from the scourge of war. My country suggests that France, which has offered its hospitality to the negotiators on Viet-Nam, could play an even more active role as mediator, thus responding to the statement of its Foreign Minister, Mr. Maurice Schumann, who said, just a few days ago that France \\\"... has allies but neither has nor wants enemies.\\\" [2041st meeting, para. 62. ].\n13.\tNot far from Viet-Nam is another suffering people- the people of Korea. As long as that country, which wants to be an entity following its reunification, continues to be the object of a power and influence struggle, peace in that region will be delayed. That is why the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland must be brought about rapidly. For our part, we consider that no State in the world has the right to stand in the way of this manifest will of the Korean people. While the delegation of Burundi takes pleasure in noting the fact that talks between the two Koreas are under way, it regrets none the less that the United Nations has not hastened the conclusion of those negotiations, in spite of the consultation asked for by the two parties.\n14.\tA no less disturbing problem is that of Bangladesh, whose fate depends largely on friendship among all the States in the area and normalization of their relations. We hope that speedy achievement of the conditions governing admission to the United Nations-which has so far been lacking may take place soon.\n15.\tWithin the same context, our delegation expresses its pleasure at the contacts between the two Germanys. This constitutes a prelude to the strengthening of European security which, we hope, will consolidate international peace and security and the well-being of the people of Germany as a whole.\n16.\tI come now to the Middle East conflict which has become a real tragedy for mankind. The Government of Burundi considers that immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) would be conducive to the restoration of peace in that part of the world. Withdrawal by Israel from the occupied Arab territories, together with settlement of the Palestinian problem, would reduce the causes of tension in that part of the world and, consequently, the frequency of individual or collective acts of violence caused by that war.\n17.\tAs a member of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] we object to any part of the territory of an African country, in this instance the Arab Republic of Egypt, being occupied by armed force. The reopening of the Suez Canal has become an imperative necessity for many African countries whose goods are subject to high transport costs.\n18.\tWe invite the two super-Powers to do their utmost to bring about a rapid settlement of the Middle East crisis which is liable to provoke a thermonuclear war at the very time when disarmament is the topic of the day.\n19.\tOn the question of disarmament, my delegation would like to make some suggestions. In spite of the signing of many agreements on the reduction of armaments, the misuse of which may well lead to a terrible catastrophe, the danger of a war threatening to wipe out mankind is far from negligible.\n20.\tThat is why the Burundi Government welcomes the courageous proposal to convene a world disarmament conference. My Government considers that such a conference is of the greatest concern to mankind as a whole which is earnestly hoping for the day when the present astronomical expenditure on weapons of destruction will be channeled towards its prosperity and happiness. In order to attain this objective fully, the conference should be held at the level of Heads of State or Heads of Government, who would take decisions to bring about total and complete disarmament.\n21.\tWe come now to problems relating to decolonization in Africa. While the African continent is dangerously threatened in the north by the Middle East conflict, other hotbeds of unrest and conflict are deliberately and cruelly maintained in the south, thus rendering peace precarious and very seriously jeopardizing its development.\n22.\tI associate the delegation of the Republic of Burundi with the representatives who have spoken before me from this rostrum, to condemn South Africa's hold on the Territory of  Namibia and also the terrible physical and moral exhaustion which it is causing to the black peoples of South Africa. \t\t\n23.\tThe results of the mission undertaken by the Secretary-General in the first half of this year as well as all the contacts and subsequent representations are impatiently awaited. Without prejudging the content of that report, we should like now to express the hope that it will provide for broad consultation with the people of Namibia. The integrity and independence of the Territory of Namibia should be safeguarded. The so-called autonomy which South Africa wishes to give separately to the different tribes instead of liberating the country as a whole, is an old colonialist maneuver designed to divide in order the better to perpetuate domination. My delegation would like to express wishes for success to the Secretary-General in this enterprise for which a Special Representative has been specifically nominated, and he should, we hope, hasten the issuing of the report so that the Organization does not have to prolong indefinitely its analysis of the case of Namibia.\n24.\tWe again urge Great Britain to do everything in its power, if necessary by force, to put an end to the rebel regime of Salisbury and to grant independence to the people of Zimbabwe struggling for its self-determination. The United Kingdom should also show its good faith in that unhappy affair instead of taking refuge behind legal subterfuges which deceive no one. The economic embargo against that country called for by the United Nations is a powerful weapon, even if it is not decisive, and it is a weapon which the British authorities could use to bring the Southern Rhodesian regime to see reason.\n25.\tThe Members of the United Nations which violate Security Council resolution 253 (1968) on sanctions are deliberately destroying United Nations institutions. An urgent examination of this question is necessary in order to adopt new working methods.\n26.\tThe problems of Rhodesia, and those of South Africa, are an exact image of the problem posed by the perpetuation of Portuguese colonialism in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Officially, Portugal considers those African Territories as its own provinces and thus, in the view of Portugal, form an integral part of that shabby, decadent empire which is an empire in name only. Portugal persists in remaining beyond the pale of history by perpetuating its domination in Africa. Notwithstanding the repeated appeals of the world Organization to bring an end to those colonial practices Portugal, in spite of the severe defeats inflicted upon it by the peoples suffering from colonial occupation, still clings, thanks to the aid of certain Powers, to the major cities which alone remain outside the control of the freedom fighters. We think for our part that without the support or the complicity of certain Powers aid with its long tradition of political incoherence Portugal alone would be incapable of resisting the fierce, resolute struggle of the peoples of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau). It is therefore incumbent upon our Organization to do its utmost to discourage those Members which, from near or far, support the bloody venture of the Portuguese colonialists. Basing itself on Article 6 of the United Nations Charter, the delegation of the Republic of Burundi has requested at previous sessions that Portugal be expelled from the Organization for having been guilty of grave crimes against peace and mankind as a whole. Since Portugal has done nothing to change its conduct and in fact is continuing to commit the most atrocious crimes, my delegation reiterates this demand for reasons which I have just mentioned and which are well known to all representatives here.\n27.\tThese Portuguese crimes are all the more reprehensible and worthy of condemnation because they often extend to independent States. No doubt you all have fresh in your memories the recent and barbaric aggression of Portugal against the people of Guinea which, thanks to their vigilance, were able to neutralize, repel and destroy the enemy. The Assembly is not unaware of the repeated attacks against the Republic of Senegal, the People's Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Zambia, the Republic of Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n28.\tThe objective of neocolonialism is quite clear: to recolonize Africa and to continue exploiting its riches. For this purpose the neo-colonialists must place in authority their own men, their faithful servants. It is in this way that neocolonialism takes a particular dislike to the progressive regimes which want to be genuinely independent.\n29.\tNor does it hesitate if necessary to use organizations and even reactionary Governments in their sinister plan of recolonization. This is particularly the context in which tribal elements supported by foreign mercenaries, encouraged by neo-colonialists, have committed aggression against our own country.\n30.\tMore than five months after the failure of the attempt at genocide organized against the people of Burundi, our Government had to depart from the course it had so rigorously observed up to then, that of confining the causes and consequences of the events of last May to the African framework.\n31.\tThus, thanks to our unswerving attachment to the OAU, we wanted to depict at the highest authority of that organization in Rabat last June the causes and effects of the storm which was unleashed over Burundi.\n32.\tHeeding the appeals for African nobility, dignity and solidarity, we refrained from exposing certain direct or indirect authors of the aggression against our people. Complying with the virtues of discreet consultation within Africa, we banked on the confession and repentance of those who from their own territories had sent elements instructed to participate in massacres of our people. This policy was respected to the letter, both in Bujumbura and by all our embassies abroad. Up to 5 October last, last Thursday in fact, the same silence we had preserved concerning the grievous guilt of one African country in the attempt to commit genocide in Burundi was going to be characteristic of our whole conduct throughout this session.\n33.\tBut, alas, since 5 October 1972 Rwanda has abused our full conformity and attachment to the ideals and approaches commended by the OAU. Confusing our recourse to calm dialog with weakness, Mr. Munyaneza, the Foreign Minister of Rwanda, departing from all norms of African wisdom, believed himself to be charged with the task of hurling thunderbolts of condemnation against Burundi. Without doubt trusting to the ingeniousness of his own imagination, the spokesman for the Kigali Government counted on the same spirit of accommodation it had so long benefited from thanks to our great circumspection and our restraint, a gesture which is unique and peculiar to Rwanda, and, after having vilified the Republic of Burundi from this very rostrum its representatives hastened, through certain intermediaries, to commend to us moderation and indeed silence, and this in the interests of the OAU and with the purpose of avoiding hostility on the subject of problems which should be resolved within the context of our own continent. Now, it is precisely in order to safeguard the prestige of our continental organization that all our authorities within the country as well as those outside it have received orders to allow nothing to filter through about the criminal role played by Rwanda in the decimation of our people.\n34.\tThus arises the inevitable question of why the delegation of Rwanda, under the leadership of Mr. Munyaneza, and certain emissaries remembered the need to keep intact the image of the OAU after having themselves tarnished it by their particularly slanderous allegations against a member State of that organization.\n35.\tThis provocative act on the part of the Foreign Minister of Rwanda has made it possible for us finally to shed all possible light on the part played by the Kigali Government in the succession of attempts at coups d'etat and acts of genocide against our people. In the course of the very day in which Mr. Munyaneza was reciting his charges against Burundi, our delegation was obliged to exercise the right of reply [2055th meeting]. Our statement addressed to Rwanda was not confined to a simple routine denial; it was based upon facts and overwhelming evidence against Rwanda, which, although it was the guilty party, actually dared to become an accuser. The massacres., which in his speech on 5 October, the Minister of National Co-operation laid to what he was pleased to describe as a feudal minority were imputable to the tribalist regime which it incarnates and which he represents.\n36.\tFrom the Government to the party, including the National Assembly, all the political institutions of Rwanda are tribalized and come from fratricidal procedures, as is shown by the most varied authorized sources, and I would venture to mention these. A report submitted to the sixteenth session of the General Assembly by the United Nations mission to Ruanda-Urundi says: \\\"In Rwanda, on the other hand, a Government has been brought to power which had from the outset followed violent methods and which had been actively supported from its foundation by the Administering Authority ...\\\" It was also stated that the racial dictatorship of a single party had been established in Rwanda and the events of the previous 18 months had consisted in a transition from one kind of oppressive regime to another. That extension was encouraged, and it was to be feared that the Tutsi would find themselves incapable of defending themselves against abuses. It was to be feared that the Tutsi would think they had nothing more to lose and that their only hope of defense lay in recourse to violence, because any possibility of a solution of conciliation had disappeared once and for all. The problem of the Africanization of official jobs had become much more complicated because of the elimination of the Tutsi.\n37.\tI should like to mention another source, a trustworthy source, to substantiate what has happened in that country, which certainly has no right to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries. I would venture to quote Radio Vatican, which described the last wave of genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1964 as one of the most terrible and most systematic acts of genocide since the genocide of the Jews by Hitler.\n38.\tThere are still other sources. The tribalist inflation in Rwanda was condemned by Rene Lemarchand in his book Rwanda and Burundi,  in which he exposes the bloody revolution of Rwanda, stating that that of Burundi was accompanied by no bloodshed when the monarchy was overthrown in 1966. Romain Foucher, in the magazine Esprit of July-August 1972, echoed the universal indignation in the face of the virulent tribalism of Rwanda: \\\"The ethnic crystallization in fact began in Rwanda, where discriminations of this type were always more advanced and more extreme and the revolution which broke out there in 1959, with its sequels which lasted until 1963, established a 'panhutu' regime, which saw the violent disappearance of some 20,000 Batutsi (the most terrible genocide that had occurred since that of the Jews, as Bertrand Russell said) as well as the forced expulsion of 200,000 others. These refugees are still today in camps, as are their Palestinian counterparts. The Rwanda example was decisive with regard to the evolution of Burundi, to the extent that the Hutu putsch of 1965, which was also accompanied by massacres\\\" of the Tutsi-children, women and old people-\\\"in the Muramvya region, seemed to be bringing the country into the same vicious circle.\\\" But fortunately the authorities were vigilant.\n39.\tAs the annihilation of our peoples was hatched with the complicity of Rwanda, the Foreign Minister of that country dares to state, in regard to the number of victims in Burundi, that \\\"more than 200,000 innocent victims have been massacred\\\" [2054th meeting, para. 22.]\n40.\tThis is the same number as was propagated from Rwanda and spread throughout the world. The Belgian newspapers Le Soir, La Cite and Remarques Africaines, in connivance with the Rwanda authorities, competed with each other in spreading and advertising this \\\"made in Rwanda\\\" product.\n41.\tThe number of targets was predetermined between Kigali and the exterminating agents, and without doubt Mr. Munyaneza is confusing his plan and the results actually achieved. Under that plan hundreds of thousands of Burundi citizens were doomed to systematic elimination. Nevertheless, some 25,000 assailants, which included a number of Rwandese, did not succeed in fully fulfilling their plan, for they met with the heroic resistance of the Burundi people, hence the crushing defeat inflicted on the attackers, which reduced to a quarter the number of targets which the Rwanda plan provided for in its first phase. Certainly the 50,000 Burundi citizens who were annihilated in the course of the first few days by the attackers represent a terrible calamity and a sad loss for our country,\n42.\tThis turn of events thwarted the diabolical consequences planned on by the Rwanda Government. We have already invoked the reasons why we made these great sacrifices, particularly in view of our wish to bring about the fraternization of the African continent. With the purpose of camouflaging its enormous guilt in these fratricidal crimes, Rwanda sent its Foreign Minister in June to foreign capitals in Asia and Europe, But it is more than high time that the country of Rwanda dispelled its own illusions, because Rwanda must be told that it does not possess the monopoly of the friendship of Asian and European Governments, which, contrary to the hopes of Rwanda, are very little disposed to believe naively everything it says implicitly.\n43.\tThe magnanimity of our Government towards Rwanda was not confined to keeping silent on the role of that country in the program of extermination. While there were quite a number of Rwanda citizens among the 20,000 attackers who died on the battlefield, Burundi preferred reserve to open denunciation of Rwanda. Can any more convincing proof against that Government be asked for than the fact that the 300 Rwanda nationals who were captured were repatriated, except for 36 of them, who are still in the hands of the Burundi authorities? In the light of the mildness that our Government lavished on Rwanda in spite of its direct and flagrant participation in the plot designed to decimate our people, it is staggering to hear the Foreign Minister of Rwanda proclaim at once his innocence and his indignation. Certainly the nightmare which haunts him stems both from the overwhelming facts against his country in our possession and from the crushing defeat of his compatriots whom he sent to commit aggression against Burundi. According to the Rwandese thesis, the Hutu of Burundi are sunk in poverty and are exploited by the \\\"Tutsi overlords\\\". If Rwanda were to be tempted to fail to recognize the criminal role which it assigned to its nationals, we would be reduced to asking it about the motives of the hundreds of Rwandese irregulars who were found on our Territory.\n44.\tLet us admit for a moment the theory of the Rwanda regime that the Hutu in Burundi are in distress and those in Rwanda are wallowing in opulence. We still have to ask Kigali whether they sent the successive waves of Rwanda irregulars to our country to join in the martyrdom of the Burundi Hutu or to commit crimes.\n45.\tThose irregulars, after having undergone intensive training in subversion, were sent to Burundi by stealth and clandestinely. Fearing that they would run into our forces of order from the very first moment they attempted to tread on Burundi soil under irregular conditions, the subversive agents coming from Rwanda infiltrated into Burundi through neighboring countries, whose good faith they abused. Such fraud is liable not only to bring about open conflict between Rwanda and Burundi, but also to embroil the latter country with its neighboring brotherly countries. The Foreign Minister of Rwanda was very ingenious in trying to condemn publicly the \\\"systematic genocide\\\" of which his own country was the principal organizer!\n46.\tMr. Munyaneza from this very rostrum repeated this imaginary number of 200,000 people massacred, a number which initially was waved around by Rwanda in order to arouse pressure abroad which would tend to make the guilty innocent. Could Rwanda reveal to us the genius thanks to which it was able to count the victims? While it is undeniably established that the Rwandese contributed to the massacres, it nevertheless seems impossible for their agents to know the number of victims, since the agents who came from Rwanda were, for the most part, mowed down in the course of battle or captured.\n47.\tThe Government of Burundi, for its part, was in a position to count the victims by means of all its military personnel, the Party, the national youth, the Union of Burundese Women and the Union of Burundese Workers, who were all mobilized in order to honor the mortal remains of their brothers and sisters who were immolated for this high ideal, namely, the indivisibility of the Burundese people.\n48.\tAll this is to the credit of the unity and determination of our people to struggle against invaders who want to import systems which have been condemned by history.\n49.\tIn the light of these facts and in such circumstances, how can Rwanda and those who have so ingeniously manipulated this random number be in a position to be better informed about the number of dead than the Burundi Government itself? We should like an answer to this question.\n50.\tWhat are we to say about the hundreds of thousands of human heads which fell in Rwanda in the course of the genocide committed in the name of the Hutu tribe from 1959 to 1964? We do not hear the Rwanda Government decrying this holocaust which it caused in order to establish a Hutu State.\n51.\tLeaving aside Pretoria, there is not in the world any country other than Rwanda with a regime that systematically excludes all other ethnic entities from the Government, from Parliament and from the Party.\n52.\tIn the event that Rwanda is inclined to contest this fact, the Government of Bujumbura on behalf of which I have the honor of speaking here, would be ready to have a mission sent-preferably from the OAU, or, if not, from the United Nations. That mission would go to our two countries in order to carry out an inquiry. In Burundi it would note that all of our successive Governments, ever since the reconquering of our independence in 1962, have included, without any exception, Hutu and Tutsi which were alternately majorities according to the criterion of individual abilities. The list of all the candidates and the elective posts were drawn up by the Union of National Progress [UPRONA], the mass party which, in the legislative elections supervised by the United Nations in 1961, obtained 94 per cent of the votes on the basis of the universal suffrage of all men and women 18 years of age and above, illiterate as well as literate.\n53.\tHowever, the Rwanda system hermetically closes the doors of Government, of Parliament and of the Party to all its sons and daughters who, by accident of birth, did not happen to be Hutus.\n54.\tHitherto we have confined ourselves to drawing up a list of all the misdeeds and atrocities committed by the Rwanda political regime. It is time now to trace the causes. Indeed, the theoreticians of that apartheid a la Hutu advocated as long ago as 1959 the creation of South African-type \\\"Bantustans\\\". In order to permit members to judge this, it suffices to read out the text of a telegram addressed in 1959 to the United Nations and to the Belgian Government by Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda, founder of the Hutu Party and the present President of Rwanda. It reads as follows:\n\\\"We Hutu represent 85 per cent of the people of Rwanda. We insistently call for racial peace with collaboration of the Belgian authorities and fear the worst for the whole country if they do not accept the geographical partition into Hutu zone and Tutsi zone. We Hutus declare furthermore that we wish to collaborate with the Belgian authorities as long as the democratization of the country, peace and progress require it for the Hutu emancipation movement. (Signed) Kayibanda.\\\"\n55.\tAfter the gloomy picture depicted above, what further proof is needed that Rwanda remains the most fertile breeding-ground of those forces which are determined to undermine and weaken the independence, sovereignty and racial harmony of Africa, forces which yesterday seriously threatened the integrity of Zaire, severed from Katanga, and which, immediately thereafter advocated the creation of a Biafra torn from Nigeria. And is it not that very same Rwanda which served as a haven for mercenaries whose claim to fame was the sowing of desolation in a sister republic, an influential member of the OAU?\n56.\tThe repeated participation of that country in genocidal plots successively organized against our people, its tribalization of all the political organs on the model of the colonialist and nazi regimes, and its granting of refuge to a mercenary clique, constitutes a trilogy which in itself suffices to demonstrate that Rwanda is nothing less than a bridgehead of the recolonization of Africa, or rather a pocket of unrepentant colonialism.\n57.\tThe extreme gravity of Rwandan interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and the low blows it struck in the unsuccessful attempt at genocide require redress by Kigali.\n58.\tMoreover, any renewed attempt is liable to lead to dire \\\"results for which Rwanda will be fully responsible.\n59.\tThe obligation upon the Government of Kigali to renounce for ever its interference in the events and situations occurring in Burundi, on the strange pretext of universalizing Hutu militancy in a sovereign State, is necessary also in the case of the refugees.\n60.\tOur Government has complied with the letter and the spirit of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, .signed at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and with the Protocol on Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration of the OAU, to such an extent that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has, in his annual report ever since 1966, described Burundi as the \\\"pilot country\\\" in this area.\n61.\tThus, more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees have found refuge in our country in their attempt to escape from the genocide of 1959-1964 and have been, for the most part, settled in regions distant from the center. The necessary measures have been taken to prevent them from adversely affecting the security of Rwanda and those measures have been and continue to remain quite effective.\n62.\tAt a time when every effort is made and all forces combined to consolidate the OAU in particular, at a time when all countries are busy forming great regional and continental groupings, it is imperative to put an end to the primitive conception of power which hampers the surge towards economic co-operation amongst peoples and the harmonization of relations among States.\n63.\tBurundi, for its part, profoundly attached to the well-being of the human race, is determined to associate itself with the growing universal movement to bring about a general improvement in the economic and international monetary system.\n64.\tImportant events which have occurred recently have revealed the fragility, the disadvantages and the disappointments inherent in the international situation within the field of economic development.\n65.\tThe monetary crisis which broke out in August 1971 and its consequences have revealed clearly the need for a revision of the international monetary system. Developing countries, which are in no way responsible for that crisis resulting from an imbalance between developed countries, are obliged to be the sufferers today of the principal adverse effects of the uncertainties born of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the subsequent monetary readjustments.\n66.\tA solution of the monetary crisis must not impose any additional burden on the developing countries, which have unreservedly co-operate in the efforts undertaken to maintain the stability of the international monetary system. Quite the contrary; special corrective measures should be taken to compensate them for their losses.\n67.\tIt is particularly important for the developing countries to make an effective contribution to the establishment of an international monetary system which would be most in keeping with their interests. The revision of the international monetary system should be studied with the effective participation of third world countries at every stage. It cannot constitute a preserve of the \\\"Group of 10\\\" alone. This revision of the Bretton Woods system should serve to bring about a solution of our development problems.\n68.\tWe note with regret that the position of the developing countries in the field of international trade, upon which their economy largely depends, continues to worsen.\n69.\tBurundi endorses the idea that developing countries should not be kept out of the preparations for new world-wide negotiations on international trade which are to take place next year.\n70.\tIn the course of those negotiations, special arrangements should be worked out to give an important place to the developing countries. Those countries should be given the opportunity to participate fully, continuously, at every stage of the negotiations.\n71.\tOur Government attaches particular importance to solutions which will be found to problems of commodities and all measures affecting access to markets J and price policies, including international machinery for the stabilization of prices, the effectiveness of existing international agreements on commodities, and any new agreements reached will be of the utmost importance to us.\n72.\tThe generalized system of preferences, in order to be more effective, should provide for the inclusion in its plans of all primary commodities which constitute the very basis of the economy of most developing countries.\n73.\tWe note with pessimism that government aid to the poorer countries is declining and that the burden of their debt is growing heavier. The recent devaluation of the dollar and the revaluation of other currencies resulted in raising the nominal value of the external debt of the third world, expressed in dollars.\n74.\tThere persists profound disagreement between developing countries as to the nature of measures to be taken to resolve the problems of indebtedness. The debates of the recent session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] confirmed this once again. We agree with the content of resolution 59 (III),  which calls upon the Trade and Development Board to institute within the framework of UNCTAD a special agency to find practical solutions to the problems which the developing countries face in the matter of debt-servicing.\n75.\tIn view of the gravity of the situation in which the developing countries find themselves in regard to their indebtedness, it is highly desirable that the conditions upon which aid is provided should be reasonable.\n76.\tThe attainment of the objective of 1 per cent of the gross national product or a financial contribution of the target of 0.7 per cent for public assistance to development and the establishment of a link between the special drawing rights and additional financial resources for development, will contribute, we are convinced, to a resolution of the difficulties of a financial type which are encountered by the developing countries.\n77.\tBurundi attaches great importance to economic co-operation and regional integration among developing countries.\n78.\tThe United Nations must pay particular attention to the long-term prospects of economic and social development, in order to view development within the broader framework of an indivisible world, in which all nations are interdependent. An over-all conception of development means that the United Nations should, here and now, assume greater responsibility in the achievement of economic development which would be better balanced at the international level.\n79.\tIn order to bring about an over-all development, it is important to recognize the role of regional co-operation. The regional economic commissions have already acquired great experience in this field and hence constitute, within the framework of the United Nations, a point of convergence of the national, subregional, regional and world development efforts.\n80.\tAn important question which is at the center of our attention is the inalienable right of the developing countries to exercise their sovereignty over their own natural resources and to take all the necessary measures to develop those resources in the interests of the economic and social development of their people. All measures or economic or political pressures from the outside, prejudicial to those rights, constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of self-determination and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. That is why we support any measure which would provide for the creation of a revolving fund of the United Nations for the exploration and exploitation of natural resources.\n81.\tWe share the concern of most Governments at the sometimes nefarious role played by international companies in the economic and social development of certain developing countries and associate ourselves with those countries which call for an expert group to study the influence of international companies in the process of development, in order to formulate conclusions which would be taken into account by Governments when they set their development policies.\n82.\tWe understand the importance attached today to the problems of environment. However, we must agree that the problems of environment which face the developing countries differ from those which face the developed countries. That is why we must allot resources to the preservation and improvement of the environment, while taking account of the particular needs of the developing countries.\n83.\tAt the present time we are witnessing great sympathy and international solidarity towards the developing countries that are the least developed. Our country properly appreciates and understands the measures contemplated for the benefit of that group of countries, to which we, unfortunately, belong.\n84.\tIn tackling problems of development the organs of the United Nations especially the United Nations Development Program like certain bilateral donors recognize that the least advanced countries and the land-locked countries should benefit from measures which would make it possible for them to profit equitably from international development policies, and we should lay stress on some of these measures.\n85.\tTechnical assistance, including training, can increase the capacity for absorption of capital inflows to developing countries, especially the least advanced of them, and in this regard it is important to co-ordinate technical assistance efforts from all organizations, both multilateral and bilateral.\n86.\tEconomic regional integration and co-operation constitutes one of these measures to the extent that it can solve problems such as the smallness of domestic markets and the question of natural and human resources, as well as the problem of limited financial resources which these countries suffer from.\n87.\tThe most advanced countries among the developing countries can plan an important role in helping the least advanced. This assistance can be given both within and outside the framework of regional economic co-operation agreements.\n88.\tWithin the realm of trade policy, we must have special supplementary measures favoring the least developed countries. There is the possibility of reducing, for example, the quota restrictions applicable to the exports of the least advanced countries and lowering taxes on tropical products, limiting non-tariff obstacles, identifying and eliminating restrictive trade practices, stabilizing the prices of tropical products and increasing the number of products to which the generalized system of preferences would apply so as to embrace products whose export is of particular interest and importance to the least-advanced countries.\n89.\tThe least developed of the developing countries, whose economy is based essentially on agriculture, cannot develop as long as their resources within the field of agriculture are backward. It is important, therefore, that special measures to improve the agriculture of the least- advanced should be adopted.\n90.\tOur country also encounters difficulties because of the fact that it is land-locked. In order to meet these difficulties it needs technical assistance, particularly in order to improve its transport infrastructure.\n91.\tBurundi will endorse any regional or subregional project in the transport field and will support any measures designed to help the land-locked countries by special freight rates and by facilitating the transit of their goods through neighboring countries.\n92.\tEconomic exchange and co-operation have always been the basis of the deepest links of the solidarity between men belonging to the same family, the same village, the same town and the same country; so why should international economic co-operation not play a unifying role for the whole world community?\n93.\tThe development of means of transport, radio, newspapers, international meetings are in the process of eliminating geographical barriers which separate or which formerly separated peoples, and promoting international economic relations. As is the case within States, economic mutual assistance should contribute to a more equitable distribution of the world's wealth among nations and put an end to the systematic exploitation of the poorest by the richest.\n94.\tThe elimination of injustice and exploitation among States is without doubt the most powerful factor promoting world peace, prosperity and the continued progress of mankind.\n95.\tBut all these objectives, all these noble goals which are contained in the United Nations Charter can be achieved only if all the peoples of the world join hands in an upsurge of solidarity and fraternity to rekindle the flame of San. Francisco, which has stirred the hearts of all men of goodwill who have joined together against the great scourges of humanity.\n96.\tIt is in that spirit that we wish every success to this session of the General Assembly and happiness and prosperity for all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first of all congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the Assembly and assure you of the whole-hearted co-operation of my delegation and its Permanent Representative in the arduous task ahead of you.\n143.\tI should also like to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, for the way in which he presided over the affairs of the General Assembly.\n144.\tI am very happy to see sitting on your right, Mr. President, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the new Secretary- General, who has already shown keen interest in the affairs of the United Nations by apprising himself personally of the views and aspirations of the peoples of the world. Mr. Secretary-General, may your endeavors bear fruit.\n145.\tI do not think it would be out of place to pay a tribute to U Thant, who retired last December after years of untiring efforts to enhance the power and the prestige of this Assembly. He had always pursued his duties with utmost understanding and devotion.\n146.\tSpeaking at this rostrum at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations [1875th meeting], I pointed out that the Organization had not fulfilled all the hopes and expectations which the poor, the weak and the disinherited of the earth had placed in it. While we recognize that it takes time to establish a new world-wide order of peace, justice and prosperity, to which we aspire, there has been good progress for peace and international agreements during the past months. The fact that the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China have come nearer to one another augurs well for the world; and the dialogs\nbetween West and East Germany and the discussions between North and South Korea are no less significant.\n147.\tI believe that we all share the Secretary-General's view that \\\"the United Nations ... remains the best long- term basis on which the international community as a whole can opt for survival, justice and progress\\\" and that \\\"in the long run there is no substitute for such an instrumentality\\\" [A/8701/Add. 1, p. 2], I submit that the Member States should endeavor to make the United Nations more and more effective with each passing year and that it is incumbent on the General Assembly at each regular session to see to it that we progress steadily towards the goals that we have set for ourselves.\n148.\tI should like now to come to a few specific points. There is no doubt that by restoring the rights of the People's Republic of China and by admitting five new States the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session took a decisive step towards ensuring conditions for the increased effectiveness of the United Nations.\n149.\tMauritius welcomes the initiative of Member States to request the General Assembly to consider the question of the admission of the new State of Bangladesh into the comity of nations. This question should not be tied up with any extraneous issue but should be considered by itself and on its own merits. Mauritius-like other countries-is of the view that with the admission of this important country to the United Nations most of the issues which are now pending between Pakistan and Bangladesh would be resolved.\n150.\tIn this connexion we are gratified that under the Simla Agreement of last July India and Pakistan have agreed, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, to renounce the use of force to settle their disputes. The normalization of relations between these two countries will contribute in a large measure to the solution of outstanding differences between Pakistan and Bangladesh. All three nations should be encouraged by the United Nations to restore conditions for a durable peace on the subcontinent. It is our view that it is not by keeping Bangladesh out of the United Nations family that we shall contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes that affect peace in South Asia.\n151.\tI appeal to the People's Republic of China to look on the admission of Bangladesh with sympathy and generosity and not to pursue the path of ostracism, for through ostracism it was itself denied for over a quarter of a century its rightful place in this Organization.\n152.\tNow I come to the very delicate issue which preoccupies the minds of most Governments at present. We have from time to time censured South Africa for its policy towards the black peoples of Africa; but to my mind South Africa's policy of apartheid and discrimination against our brothers and sisters in Africa has paled into insignificance against the recent action of Uganda, namely, the expulsion of Asians from that country and the expropriation of their property. We have all been put to shame, and in the name of humanity and peace I appeal to President Amin to search his own heart and reconsider the situation. Otherwise there will be no distinction between the policies adopted by \nUganda and those adopted by South Africa. After all, South Africa has not dispossessed and expelled people because of their origin or race, thus bringing about the great hardships which would have followed such a policy of utter disregard of the principles on which this world Organization is based.\n153.\tWithout interfering in the internal policy of any State, I should like to deal now with another problem facing our brothers still struggling for their respective independence.\n154.\tIn our own lifetime peoples of all countries have fought two World Wars for justice and freedom and for equality of opportunity for all, and the last World War has now been behind us for over 27 years. Yet, despite the efforts of this great Organization and of the economically backward peoples of the world, there are still colonial Territories struggling for their rights. Four years ago I touched upon this problem in the Assembly [1765th meeting], and we are still in a dark tunnel groping our way towards a dawn that we should like to see for each of these Territories.\n155.\tThere can be no justification today for a country to be under the domination of one colonial Power or another. I am not making an indictment of these Powers; my purpose today is to appeal to their conscience and to countries.represented in this Organization. I feel that the big Powers which are now holding large tracts of territories inhabited by other peoples should relinquish their hold over these territories, preserving, if they so wish, their economic, cultural and other ties with them.\n156.\tFriendly Governments to which I am appealing must not take my remarks amiss, but rather search their own hearts to see whether there is any more justification whatsoever for keeping colonies in this decade. There are ugly aspects to these dominations of territories, for such territories are used as bases for the economic and political subversion of the neighboring countries which have become independent. If freedom per se cannot come to these countries, I again suggest to this Assembly that we .should revive the Trusteeship Council, under whose umbrella all the remaining Territories should live and be enabled to secure their independence at some future time; otherwise I see no hope for them. I know that I am touching on a very sensitive issue, but in the name of God and in the name of justice I ask the Powers concerned to pursue a policy of live and let live. I leave this problem to the representatives here for consideration and action.\n157.\tI am glad that the subject of terrorism has been discussed. Let us hope that moderation and wisdom will bring about a better state of affairs. But it will be necessary in the first instance to define terrorism and to exclude from its connotations the freedom-fighters and liberation movements for which the Organization of African Unity has doubled its contribution this year. But after they have been excluded, to whom will terrorism refer? To the Arabs and the hijackers? We can see immediately how delicate the problem becomes. We all deplore and condemn terrorism, and I am glad that in his statement at the 2038th meeting Mr. William Rogers, Secretary of State of the United States, has defined at great length the several aspects of terrorism and given a new and, no doubt, acceptable orientation to this problem. I am convinced that all States will consider favorably the draft convention submitted by the United States for the prevention and punishment of certain acts of international terrorism [A/C. 6/L.850].\n158.\tWhile on my way to the United Nations I had the opportunity of visiting the Middle East, and I am more than over convinced that it should be the first aim of this Assembly with the help of the super-Powers, which are really responsible for the tension in that part of the world-to bring about peace with honor. I am sure that it should be possible for the Federation of Arab Republics and other neighboring Arab countries to recognize the frontiers of Israel and live in peace with it, provided Israel withdraws from the territories it is occupying against the wishes of its neighbors. Otherwise, the peace of the world will continue to be threatened without any hope of reconciliation.\n159.\tAs I have just emphasized, the main concern of this Assembly should be to promote peace everywhere in the world, and it is heartening to think that the General Assembly at its last session declared that \\\"the Indian Ocean... is hereby designated for all time as a zone of peace\\\" [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and in that resolution called upon the great Powers and all other States concerned to enter into immediate consultations with each other with a view to halting the further escalation and expansion of their presence in the Indian Ocean and eliminating from the Indian Ocean all bases, military installations, the disposition of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction and any manifestation of great Power military presence in the Indian Ocean conceived in the context of great Power rivalry.\n160.\tIn the framework of resolution 2832 (XXVI) containing the declaration, Mauritius will continue to cooperate with all other parties concerned in order to make the Indian Ocean a nuclear-free zone and an area of peace.\n161.\tFurther, considering the achievements of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], of which Mauritius is a proud member, we share the conviction of the Secretary- General that \\\"regional organizations have a vital role to play in any workable world order\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 3]. Without divesting itself of its prerogatives with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security, the United Nations should encourage regional organizations set up in accordance with the principles of the Charter to play their role as agencies of first resort to deal with local disputes and conflicts among Member States. The success achieved by OAU in this regard is important. At our last summit conference,  we had occasion to witness once again peaceful methods of solving disputes by negotiation, mediation, conciliation and arbitration. As often as possible the regional organizations should be given the opportunity to maintain regional peace, in accordance with Article 52 of the Charter.\n162.\tTurning now to the main requirement for lasting peace, namely, the question of general and complete disarmament, we have to note that the most decisive measures to end the arms race remain to be taken. Of course, we are gratified that agreements on partial measures of disarmament have been reached and that the talks on strategic arms limitations have been concluded successfully. But as long as there is no comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, we cannot genuinely speak of the possibility of peace. It may be that such a world disarmament conference as proposed by the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the answer. We believe that such a conference, if adequately prepared as suggested in resolution 2833 (XXVI), will bring about the desired results, provided that the fundamental issues, including the stopping of all nuclear testing and the destruction of all existing nuclear weapons, are fully gone into beforehand.\n163.\tIf we consider all the problems of social and economic development facing two thirds of mankind, we realize how essential it is to take the bold steps that are called for in order to take measures for population control. Mauritius, as one of the countries plagued by a population explosion and consequent unemployment, is aware, perhaps more than most countries, that lack of economic development breeds social unrest which may result in serious internal conflicts. Accordingly, Mauritius .is engaged seriously in mobilizing all its population-controlling institutions under the aegis of the State. It is in this way that Mauritius hopes to provide increasing opportunities to its people for a better life, by removing obstacles to their economic and social progress.\n164.\tFinally, it is our firm belief that the United Nations could best serve mankind if it could become the center for harmonizing human endeavors in the political, economic and social fields.\n"

        "file_text": "President, may I be permitted first of all, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Niger, to convey to you warm congratulations on the confidence placed in you and your country by your brilliant election to preside over the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your personal qualities and your long experience with international problems provide, in the opinion of my delegation, firm assurances of the fruitful development of our work.\n2.\tMay I be permitted also to associate my delegation and my country with the so well-deserved tributes that previous speakers have addressed to Mr. Adam Malik for the courtesy and efficiency with which he presided over our twenty-sixth session, which proved so delicate in so many respects.\n3.\tI should also like to convey to the Secretary-General of the United Nations an expression of the confidence that the Government of Niger places in him. Since he was appointed to this high post he has demonstrated by his energy and his courageous initiatives that he intends to assume to the full his exceedingly difficult role.\n4.\tYear after year we meet in this august Assembly with representatives of an ever-increasing number of nations. But year after year we find ourselves grappling again with the same serious problems that still have not been solved. What is even worse, some of the most burning questions, questions on which the peace of the world depends, do not appear on the agenda of our session.\n5.\tOnce again we must note the ineffectualness of the United Nations in an area considered as of primary importance by its founding fathers and affirmed in Article 1 of the Charter: that is, the area of the maintenance of international peace and security. Increasingly, this has appeared as the privileged preserve of the super-Powers. We must accept the evidence. Everywhere where there is no convergence of interests among the super-Powers disputes remain unsolved. That is a situation whose seriousness escapes no one. Thus, certain serious problems have been frozen for decades: here, large countries remain artificially divided in two; there, entire nations see themselves refused the right to self-determination or to the free choice of a government; elsewhere, cruel wars are raging with no end to them in sight.\n6.\tDuring the past year, however, we have witnessed some encouraging signs. The two parties in Korea have sketched out a rapprochement, or at least a relaxation of tension. The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have begun conversations. The Governments of India and Pakistan, despite a particularly painful dispute, have met together again. At the great-Power level, we have witnessed some events but we cannot yet estimate their implications. However, as of today we can congratulate ourselves on the arrangements concluded at Moscow on the limitation of strategic weapons. We would like to hope that this will come to represent a first step towards more general disarmament, which will relieve humanity from the specter of war and free for peaceful and constructive work the vast sums swallowed up each year in military expenditure in almost every country.\n7.\tBut these few signs of relaxation of tension cannot lead us to forget the troubled areas. In Viet-Nam, where last year we thought we saw a glimmering of hope for a peaceful settlement, the fighting resumed a few months ago, intensified beyond any level we had witnessed before, causing incredible destruction and human suffering. And we still do not see any end to this tragedy of a whole people, while the United Nations, for a whole series of reasons, hardly participates as effectively as could be desired in the efforts made in various quarters to achieve a negotiated solution.\n8.\tNeither can we discern any gleam of hope in the Middle East. Last year, at this time, we hoped at least for a partial, temporary solution concerning traffic through the Suez Canal. Unfortunately, this feeble hope seems today to have been abandoned. The Jarring mission appears to have been compromised. Now it is absolutely essential to reactivate that mission or find some other approach likely to get the negotiations out of the impasse in which they are bogged down now.\n9.\tNiger for its part abides by Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and considers that the great Powers should be in a position to impose its strict application, with all the desired guarantees for the establishment of an equitable and \nlasting peace. That is a responsibility which they cannot evade.\n10.\tNiger is aware that it has always sought to maintain the best of relations with all the independent countries of the world, at least so long as others refrained from intervening in our domestic affairs.\n11.\tWhat is more, President Diori Hamani has acquired the reputation of being an impartial and wise mediator and his action to restore harmony among the African States has been decisive on more than one occasion. Quite recently we had the pleasure of helping neighbors and brothers to clear up a painful misunderstanding which had developed between their Governments.\n12.\tMoreover, we try to work as closely as possible with our African neighbors in order to pursue, by successive stages, the ideal of African unity. Whether this be within the framework of the Council of the Entente or in the wider framework of the African and Malagasy Common Organization [OCAMJ, or the Organization of African Unity [OAU], Niger is convinced that it has chosen the path of realistic and brotherly co-operation. At this very moment it is seeking to create with its neighbors of West Africa, a large economic community which would be in a position to encourage the development of this vast geographic area by binding more closely together the nations that make up this region.\n13.\tIn North Africa, in Central Africa and in East Africa, similar groupings are emerging. We welcome these realistic events with hope and confidence.\n14.\tIt is with the same hope and the same confidence, and in the same spirit of essential solidarity, that my country, adding its voice to the already numerous voices of so many others, appeals with all its strength for the holding of a world conference on freedom of navigation and the common exploitation of resources of all sorts which lie on the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the territorial waters established by each State. It is in this way and this way alone that the land-locked countries will be able, injustice, to play their full role in international trade.\n15.\tUnfortunately there is another vast region of our African continent, southern Africa, which is a matter of concern and scandal to us.\n16.\tAlthough world public opinion is becoming increasingly sensitive to the problems of decolonization and racial discrimination, and although from time to time it has succeeded in imposing its will on international bodies, we are compelled to note that the Portuguese Government, the racist regime of Pretoria and the illegal Government of Southern Rhodesia have in no way altered their attitude and their policy. For more than a decade now despite innumerable debates, despite all the resolutions adopted by the Assembly on apartheid, on decolonization, on Rhodesia and on Namibia, these colonial Governments, which are the remnants of an era that we had thought long past, are flouting international public opinion and making a mockery of the United Nations community.\n17.\tBut it is obvious that this incredible arrogance, this permanent affront to international morality is made possible only by the culpable inertia of the big Powers, inertia which sometimes extends to complicity. There is no doubt in our mind that if the principal Western Powers, by common agreement, would withdraw their overt or covert support from these regimes and their support of Rhodesia is the most scandalous-they would quickly be brought to terms.\n18.\tWe call upon the great Powers to understand and to seize this historic moment and to cease their support of these anachronistic regimes, support which they justify by what are often fallacious arguments. We call upon them to find a solution to these painful problems. They have just been given a fine lesson in this sense by the World Council of Churches at its recent meeting in Utrechi. It decided to boycott companies and banks operating in South Africa, in Rhodesia and in the Portuguese colonies and has called upon all churches to support the appeal of the African Council of Rhodesia for the convening of a national convention in that country. We congratulate ourselves on these initiatives of this eminent international body, which enjoys vast moral prestige. In the long run, they will certainly not fail to have a decisive influence at least we should like to hope so-on the Governments on which in the final analysis the solution of these problems will depend.\n19.\tThe Government of Niger expects the South African Government to respect the resolutions of the United Nations, particularly that which set up a committee on the question of Namibia. It firmly expects that this committee will be set up without delay and that it will facilitate the access of the people of Namibia to full sovereignty in the shortest possible time.\n20.\tAs for the Portuguese Government, which stubbornly insists on pursuing its inhuman and anachronistic colonial policy, when will it understand, and when will its Western allies finally make it understand, that it is vain to try to hold back the inexorable course of history? The independence and accession to full sovereignty of Angola, of Guinea (Bissau) and Mozambique are inevitably inscribed in the records of the world's history. Any attempt to set back the date not only affronts the universal conscience but also submits the people of Angola themselves to the most criminal deception in its history.\n21.\tWith respect to Southern Rhodesia, my Government calls upon Great Britain to take the full measure of its responsibilities and to draw the necessary conclusions from the recent failure of the agreement concluded with the illegal regime of Ian Smith. It immediately became obvious that the terms of that agreement had been rejected by the vast majority of the population. To continue to close one's eyes to the state of affairs is tantamount to forcing the black majority to have recourse to violence as the only way out of this unjust situation.\n22.\tTurning to the item inscribed in the agenda at the request of the Secretary-General, namely, international terrorism [item 92], the Republic of Niger, while rejecting terrorism as a means of combat, believes that it must be defined very carefully in legal terms because we must not confuse terrorism with the legitimate struggle which people are waging, as an extreme solution, to conquer the rights of which they have been deprived.\n23.\tAny effective measure should in our opinion strike at the roots of the evils known as armed struggle throughout the world, colonization and apartheid in Africa in a word desires for intolerance, hegemony and human passions.\n24.\tFinally, in an area which is very dear to our hearts, our disappointment has been very great indeed. I refer to the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ which was held a few months ago in Santiago, Chile. Despite intensive preparations, despite the appeals and the warnings from all sides, uttered not only by the representatives of the poorer countries, but also by enlightened minds within the group of industrialized countries, that confrontation at the world level, which could have resulted in a global development strategy, ended in a thinly disguised failure.\n25.\tNone of the major claims of the developing countries was accepted: neither the commitment of the wealthier countries to devote a greater part of their gross national product to investments in the third world, nor the promise to associate the poorer countries more closely with far- reaching monetary decisions that affect them as much and even more than the developed countries, nor even the glimmerings of an organization of the trade in commodities which would halt the continuing deterioration of the terms of trade between the industrialized countries and the poor countries.\n26.\tTo what extremes, therefore, must the poor be reduced before the wealthier countries, suddenly enlightened as to their true interests, will finally agree to come to grips with these problems with all the urgency and seriousness that they require?\n27.\tThe only positive decision taken by the Santiago Conference was the selection of the 25 least favored countries which should receive preferential treatment. Since Niger was placed in this category some might tell us perhaps that we are ill-placed to complain about the results of the Conference. To this I would answer that it is our duty to speak in solidarity, in the name of all of the States members of the group of under-developed countries, since it is precisely because of a lack of solidarity that we have not succeeded in having our just claims recognized heretofore.\n28.\tThose are the few brief thoughts that my Government instructed me to put before the General Assembly because, in Niger, despite the inevitable setbacks encountered along the way, our hope in the United Nations remains firmer and more resolute than ever.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to convey to you the very warm congratulations of the Irish delegation on your election as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly.\n58.\tIn your inaugural address you stated that your country owes its existence, its freedom, its independence and its present dynamic development to great effort on the part of its people but also to tremendous sacrifices'\\\" [2032nd meeting, para. 55].\nHere I am reminded of an observation made by the Polish representative in the Security Council on 29 August 1946 in connexion with our application for admission to the United Nations. On that occasion Dr. Lange said that\n.. the people of Poland have always, throughout the whole history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, had a great sympathy and feeling of great and deep community with the people of Ireland\\\". \nThese are sentiments which are fully reciprocated by the Irish people. Consequently my delegation is most gratified that the presidency of the Assembly should be assumed by Poland, and we are particularly happy that this high office should devolve on a personality of your experience and competence. The proceedings over the past three weeks have demonstrated that you will discharge your functions in a manner calculated to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to enhance the standing of the Organization.\n59.\tI should like, too, to say how much my delegation welcomed the election last December of Mr. Waldheim to fill the office of Secretary-General. Naturally his long experience in the field of international affairs, both as representative of his country at the United Nations and elsewhere and as Foreign Minister, eminently fitted him to undertake the onerous duties of that office. In the intervening months we have admired the initiative and drive he has shown since assuming those functions.\n60.\tWe have in particular been gratified by the Secretary- General's determination to use the powers conferred on him by Article 99 of the Charter to call attention to serious situations and by the readiness he has shown to make himself available to help in resolving such situations. We sincerely hope that the international community will heed his advice and will take advantage of the services which he, as depositary of important responsibilities under the Charter and ideally placed to play a detached role, is so well qualified to render. My delegation much appreciates his offer to help in any way possible in connexion with the North of Ireland.\n61.\tWhen I spoke in this Assembly at the twenty-sixth session [1956th meeting] I said that we in Ireland believed that political and moral power grew not out of the barrel of a gun but out of the will of people to act together so as to translate values into facts. The United Nations was established for this purpose.\n62.\tMen of vision and goodwill felt that the old inter-national order of sovereign, independent States which had characterized the nineteenth century was no longer adequate. The social, economic and political realities of the modern world require that we achieve a saner and more balanced view of our relations with our neighbors, within national societies, and between nation and nation, and indeed a saner and more balanced relationship between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit.\n63.\tTo meet our individual and collective purposes we are constantly adapting structures and institutions or developing new ones. If the structures fail the fault may lie not in the institution itself but in the will of the national or the international community to make it work. As a structure, the United Nations, the Secretary-General reminds us in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, is \\\"not an independent sovereign organization but an association of sovereign Governments, and ... its failures are also their failures\\\". [A/8701/Add.l, p. 2.]\n64.\tThe ability of the Organization to succeed is primarily dependent on the will of its Members. I believe that, if one examines the Organization's work and achievements to date and, more importantly, its capacity to meet the needs of the contemporary international society, one must conclude that as a structure, while some adaptations and adjustments could profitably be undertaken, the United Nations remains adequate for the tasks which it has assumed. It is not the structure which is lacking. It is the will and commitment to make it work that must be continually reinforced.\n65.\tThe central political function of the United Nations, as the Secretary-General has recalled, is, in the words of the preamble to the Charter, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". We can do this by making the Organization an instrument of collective security. Although mankind has been spared the horror of a third world war, nevertheless we are all aware that the United Nations has been unable to act to end a series of bitter and long-drawn- out localized conflicts. However, its failure in this regard is not due to the weakness of the Organization itself but manifestly to the unwillingness of the parties to those conflicts to make use of the instruments of peace-making and peace-keeping which the United Nations has at its disposal.\n66.\tThis is the eighth regular session in which our agenda includes as an item \\\"Comprehensive review of the whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their aspects\\\" [item 41]. It is well known that the Irish delegation has long stressed the importance of this item, for it is obvious that situations can arise, and quite unexpectedly, in which the peace-keeping role of the international community is the most effective means of containing potentially explosive conflicts. Ireland consequently has contended that it is essential that the United Nations evolve a system, within the existing structure, by which a peace-keeping operation can be mounted at short notice and can be effectively pursued until it has achieved its purpose. We have always held that the establishment of a peace-keeping operation is primarily a matter for the Security Council, but we have contended equally that if the Council cannot take that step the residual authority of the Assembly should be capable of being invoked. Moreover, once an operation has been mounted, it is vital that its successful completion should not be jeopardized through the inadequacy of the method of financing it.\n67.\tMany previous speakers have referred to recent encouraging and hopeful developments in international and political relations the movement towards detente and dialog between the great Powers and between nations and States which are divided or dismembered by ideology or the fortunes of war. Ireland welcomes these developments, as we welcome, too, the movement towards full universality in this Organization, which gained enormous momentum last year when the People's Republic of China took its place among us. My delegation believes that Bangladesh should be a Member of the United Nations. For dialog detente and universality must surely serve to strengthen the structure of the United Nations and strengthen both the confidence of the peoples in the Organization and their will to make it work.\n68.\tThe difficulties confronting national and international society are frequently more acute and more complex in the economic area. The United Nations, through UNCTAD, is engaged in what the distinguished Foreign Minister of France rightly called a \\\"great movement of solidarity\\\" [2041st meeting, para. 73].\n69.\tThe problems with which UNCTAD has to deal are numerous, delicate and difficult. They directly affect the well-being and livelihood of all the peoples of the world.\nThe relatively disappointing results of the third session of UNCTAD, which took place some months ago in Chile, should not, therefore, be allowed to weaken our determination to persevere. The session should not be judged solely in the light of its immediate or concrete results. It served to define more clearly the areas in which our efforts must be concentrated and has made the international community both more aware of what needs to be done and more alive to the need to do it. It also demonstrated that, while the many problems involved are interrelated, the best hope of success lies in attacking them individually rather than in trying to solve them all simultaneously.\n70.\tThe interplay of our will to act and the structures through which we can act in the political and economic spheres is also manifest in the complex relations between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit. There has been a growing realization in recent years of the importance of achieving a saner and more balanced view of the relations between man and the human environment. Piecemeal and uncoordinated development of industry, overpopulation, urbanization and rural depopulation, we now realize, can disturb, and have disturbed, the delicate balance between man and his ecological habitat. Resources have been depleted by rapacious exploitation; other resources have been destroyed by pollution and industrial waste; and many of the great cities of our civilization have been made barbarous by the refuse of mindless consumerism and planned obsolescence.\n71.\tThe recent success of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, is therefore a heartening sign. It is evidence of a growing realization of the gravity and complexity of the problems which world industrialization and urbanization have created and of a willingness to develop through the United Nations system a means of regulating growth and achieving and maintaining a proper equilibrium between the exploitation and conservation of the earth's resources. The tasks of the United Nations in this regard and its responsibility to succeeding generations are hardly less arduous and grave than those which it has assumed in its primary purpose of saving our children from the scourge of war.\n72.\tTwice in this century the clash of opposing national wills brought war to Europe. And the tragic lesson which war sometimes teaches and out of which the United Nations was born has a crucial relevance for Europeans. Those who had endured those terrible years had also reaped a new wisdom. The leaders of Europe realized that, if the continent was to avoid a further and perhaps final catastrophe, a profound transformation of European relations was necessary. National economic and political rivalries and dissension had to be replaced by co-operation and consensus.\n73.\tJust as the adoption of the United Nations Charter laid the foundation of a new world structure and order, the Treaty of Rome  laid the foundations of a new regional structure and order in which the peoples of Europe would assume obligations which bound them even more closely and committed them to work out together the common destiny to which both geography and history summoned them. In the years since 1957, when the Treaty of Rome was signed, the European Economic Community has undergone a process of evolution and development-which has been sometimes painful and often difficult but which, we are confident, is now about to repay the work, the tenacity and the vision of those men who labored to translate the ideal of European economic and political unity into a reality.\n74.\tSince I last addressed this Assembly the Irish people have expressed their overwhelming will to participate fully in the European Economic Community, which in a few months' time, with the accession of new member States, will group together some 250 million people. Ireland will bring its own heritage to this community of complementary cultures-which in Europe is endeavoring to build unity in diversity and, through co-operation and consensus, to guarantee to all our children that birthright of peace, of physical security, of material prosperity and of moral enrichment which should and can be the right of all mankind.\n75.\tOne paragraph in the speech made in this general debate by the United Kingdom Secretary of State struck me as being especially arresting. Speaking in the context of Europe about East-West relations, he said:\n\\\"We must face the facts even when they are unpleasant. Since the last World War the confrontation over the years between the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led to an almost total loss of confidence. Western Europe had no desire for this, but the fact is that neighborliness, once confidence is broken, cannot be recreated in a day.\\\" [2042nd meeting, para. 107.]\n76.\tThese remarks are, I feel, cogent in another context, that of Northern Ireland, and relevant to another relationship, that of my country and Great Britain. For the relationship between Britain and Ireland could not escape the influence of events in Northern Ireland over the past three or four years. These events have tended to reduce the problem there more and more to its most basic elements. The problem derives essentially from a conflict of political wills and is aggravated by a defective political structure.\n77.\tThe conflict of wills is that between Unionism and anti-Unionism, between those who seek to perpetuate a nakedly sectarian state in Northern Ireland-while pro-testing their loyalty and allegiance to Britain and British democracy-and those who are struggling for basic civil rights and substantial recognition of the legitimacy of their allegiance to the ideal of a united Ireland.\n78.\tNorthern Ireland was created as a political entity in order to provide an area in which to cater separately for unionism in Ireland. In the demographic and political circumstances of Ireland as a whole in 1920, when Northern Ireland was established, unionism could not-and cannot today-exist on its own. A purely Unionist area could not, and cannot, be established as viable. To cater for unionism therefore required the creation of an area divided into two communities with assured dominance for one. The structure of Northern Ireland, in consequences, had political instability built into it from the beginning. As a solution for the Anglo-Irish problem it was, in the words of my Prime Minister, \\\"a recipe for slow disaster\\\".\n79.\tA permanent peace and genuine democracy cannot be established until all the elements of the dilemma in Northern Ireland are squarely faced and dealt with together. And as I have said, the central dilemma of the North lies not only in a conflict of wills, but in the fact that this conflict of wills can never be resolved within the existing structure of Northern Ireland. A permanent solution therefore can only be found, in the view of my delegation, through a genuine attempt both to resolve the conflict of wills and to replace the existing structure.\n80.\tTo date, all the attempts by Britain and by successive Belfast administrations to bring about consensus government in Northern Ireland through reform have focused on only one element of the dilemma. In 1969 when the abuses which the divisions within the area had made virtually inevitable came to world attention Britain intervened to see to the reform of these abuses. Attempts at piecemeal reform and the violent refusal of the more reactionary Unionists to accept them brought no stability and the situation grew worse.\n81.\tMoreover the attempts at conciliation were accompanied by efforts to coerce the minority, which simply increased their alienation, and generated tolerance or support for violent tactics, and this in turn left the two communities in the North of Ireland even further divided than before. In short, these attempts to resolve the conflict of wills failed. Six months ago, in March, in the face of persistent violence and instability, Britain took the more drastic step of suspending the structures of dominance within the area by proroguing the Northern Parliament in an effort to reassemble the shattered pieces of the structure in a more equitable and stable way. But what Britain has to face is that the very structure of Northern Ireland the unworkable attempt to create an area to deal separately with unionism in Ireland-is the fundamental difficulty and that there is no way in which the pieces can be put together again so as to have permanent stability within a purely Northern Ireland setting. If a successful political structure is to be built, it must be one which is open to, and capable of, operating in a wider context, that of Ireland as a whole.\n82.\tBut the conflict of wills must also be faced. Britain and Ireland together with the divided communities in the North will have to be involved in the resolution of that conflict. The deepest concerns of the Unionist community in Ireland will have to be, and can be, met by an eventual accommodation with the national majority by negotiation and on terms acceptable to both. And the deepest concerns and desires of the Unionist community in Ireland cannot be met any other way-certainly not by coercion or by the inter-communal violence who threatens all Irishmen with common ruin.\n83.\tIt is evident that there can be no instant solution to the present difficulties. Short-term measures alone, based on a simple balance of forces within the area, will not be enough.\n84.\tThere is general acceptance at present of the need to provide a new framework for administration in the North of Ireland. This administration must provide for an equitable division of political power between the elected representatives of the communities in the area, and there must be no possibility of the abuse of security powers in the interests of one community. Beyond this, there must be recognition of, and a real political outlet for, the legitimate aspirations of the non-Unionist community.\n85.\tInterim measures can allow a process of reconciliation to begin: membership by Britain and both parts of Ireland in the European Community will undoubtedly help. But the process of reconciliation will advance only if there is an acceptance of the need to promote and work positively towards a stable and lasting settlement on a new basis in Ireland. It is not enough simply to speak of this as a \\\"legitimate aspiration\\\", or to suggest that reconciliation, now, is a prerequisite to any progress towards this aim. If a real and lasting process of reconciliation is to begin now, there must be courageous and far-sighted policy decisions aimed at such a settlement, and there must be provision for movement towards it as the opportunities become available.\n86.\tIn brief, the aim must be not merely to hope for but to encourage actively, by every available political means, progress towards a new Ireland. It would clearly be wrong to repeat on a larger scale in the island as a whole a pattern which has already proved unstable in the North. So we must try to achieve, by agreement, new political institutions in Ireland which do not divide its communities or subordinate one to another, but which are responsive to all elements of its population and their diversity of outlook and tradition. A beginning must be made now which will promote and encourage progress in the right direction, but it would be unwise to demand absolutes, or to set a rigid time-table.\n87.\tIn speaking to the General Assembly as I have done on tills issue, which deeply troubles us in Ireland, I should like to emphasize that my Government does not consider that the interests of the national majority in Ireland are in any way at variance with the real, long-term interests of the Unionist community. Nor are the interests of the Irish people in conflict with those of the British people. We consider that a stable and lasting settlement in Ireland on the basis I have outlined is in the real interest of both, and we believe and hope that the British Government will come to see this, if indeed it has not begun to do so already.\n88.\tOver the past year there have been exchanges of view between the British and Irish Governments on the mutual problem of Northern Ireland. The situation there and the approach to it I have outlined require deep involvement by both Governments.\n89.\tThe Irish Government, for its part, is fully prepared to play a constructive role in reaching a just and lasting settlement of this last difficult problem in Anglo-Irish relations. It will act, by every constitutional means open to it, to work towards a reasoned political settlement, because it believes such a settlement would be clearly in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland, of both the British and Irish Governments, and of all the people of both islands.\n"

        "file_text": "The first word I should like to mention as I mount this rostrum for the fifth time is hope, a difficult virtue. I am encouraged to do so, Mr. President, by your accession to this high office, which was distinguished last year by the prestige of Mr. Adam Malik. I am thinking of the ties which have linked my country to yours for almost six centuries, ties which, if such a thing is possible, will be strengthened still further by Mr., Gierek's forthcoming visit to France. I also have in mind the important lesson of perseverance that Poland has continually lavished on Europe and the world. But the virtue of hope has also been called to mind by the praises earned in a matter of months by our new Secretary- General-a worthy successor to the man who, for the sake of the United Nations, pushed himself to the very limit of his strength. We all knew that Kurt Waldheim excelled in every intellectual quality. Today we all know that he is no less distinguished by his strength of character. He is not a man to shun the new duties which loom in his path, and so it is to him that I would first address myself.\n61.\tFrance immediately and unconditionally condemned \\\"the acts of terrorism and reprisals which are increasing the numbers of innocent victims\\\", to quote the exact terms of the communique that my friend Mr. Schmelzer, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, read on 12 September on behalf of the Conference of the 10 European Ministers of Foreign Affairs who were meeting near Rome. My country therefore shares the anguish of the Secretary- General and endorses his initiative, which we feel sets an example in two respects: first of all, because it aims at breaking the merciless chain of indiscriminate violence, and secondly, because the man who took this initiative intends to grapple not only with the most tragic consequences but also with the deep-seated causes of the problem, as the most authoritative voice in France again requested him to do some days ago in connexion with the Palestinian problem; that \\\"human and therefore political problem\\\". I am in particular happy that the Assembly has decided to include on its agenda the examination of the problem of international terrorism as a whole and that it has entrusted this task to its Sixth Committee, which will, I am sure, approach this urgent and painful issue with all the attention and to recall the word used a few moments ago by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lebanon from this same rostrum-objectivity that it requires. Mr. Waldheim has, moreover, already proved this. No obstacle deters him when it is a question of implementing Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.\n62.\tWhy should the spokesman for an old European country feel today despite all the preoccupations he and every one of us has  that hope prevails over his distress of mind? It is because this year has seen two events which are grounds for certainty: first of all, Europe is moving ahead; secondly, such a forward movement brings us nearer our common goal, namely, closer co-operation and better understanding with all peoples. If I ask your permission to link this central idea, like a conducting wire, to certain major issues which require our reflection, it is because I am speaking on behalf of a country which, as I say again deliberately, has allies but neither has nor wants enemies.\n63.\tSo let us turn our attention to Europe, towards the whole of Europe, where we shall find grounds for reassurance.\n64.\tIt was on 3 June 1972 that the Treaties of Moscow^ and Warsaw  were ratified. It was on 3 June 1972, at the same moment, that the final protocol of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin was signed by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Rogers and myself. This protocol implemented an agreement which has been supplemented by arrangements concluded by all the German authorities. The negotiations were difficult, but none of the parties imposed its point of view on the others. On the contrary, the balance achieved between the reciprocal concessions was an example worth following and could only serve to strengthen equilibrium in Europe.\n65.\tMay the same spirit inspire the negotiators who are now striving to define relations between the two German States. The success of their efforts matters all the more for this Assembly because one of their objectives is to permit these two States to present themselves together before our Organization. When the time comes-and the sooner the better-the four Powers which will continue to have special duties vis-a-vis Germany and Berlin will undoubtedly be the first to want to support these two candidates for admission to the United Nations. We have become even more aware since China has joined us that the United Nations has a universal mission.\n66.\tOne year ago [1942nd meeting] I said of the European Economic Community that it was in the process of being enlarged. On 1 January the Community will group together some 250 million Europeans. Meanwhile, owing to the success of the negotiations with countries which are members of the European Free Trade Association and are not applying for membership, a vast network of agreements will link the Community to the whole of Western Europe. In a month's time in Paris the Heads of State or Government of member countries of the Community will meet, as was said recently in the course of a Franco-Italian meeting by my colleague and friend, Mr. Medici, not so much to congratulate themselves on such a success, but rather to take stock of the responsibilities incumbent upon them, responsibilities first of all towards their own people who do not want European economic integration to lose in depth what it is gaining in breadth. On the contrary, they want to expand into new fields, beginning with those of currency and the battle against inflation,\n67.\tWith regard to the other industrialized countries, the Community should also be prepared, without ever abdicating its autonomy of decision, to encourage extensive and balanced development of trade on the basis of reciprocal advantage.\n68.\tBut the French Government feels that it is particularly essential for the enlarged Community to define vis-a-vis the developing countries and, in the first instance, vis-a-vis the former associates of the Common Market, a policy no less generous than that practiced by the six members, a policy worthy of being called European. Lastly, there can be no development restricted to Western Europe. Consequently, while Western Europe is being built, the countries which comprise it are striving to strengthen their ties or to forge new ties with the nations which inhabit the eastern part of our continent.\n69.\tAnd here is the third reason for Europeans to regard 1972 as memorable despite certain inevitable disappointments: the conference on security and co-operation in Europe no longer looks like just a grand design. In two months, multilateral preparations for the conference will at last begin in Helsinki. We shall do everything possible to ensure that next year the conference itself will attain its true objective, an objective that is of interest and concern to all the countries represented here: to replace-for this is indeed the issue the confrontation of blocs with dialog between peoples.\n70.\tIt took a thousand years of harsh and turbulent history for Europe to thus arrive at the beginnings of wisdom. The memory of the horrors of two world wars which began there help Europe today better to understand the price of peace and better to uphold the chances for it. The dangers through which democracy has passed in so many European countries, and to which it often succumbed, have put Europe in a better position today to weigh the price of freedom. The grandeur, but also the shadows, of its colonial past enable Europe the better to shun many forms of imperialism. Never has Europe, in its relative equilibrium, seemed better able to defend a certain ideal, which is none other than that of the United Nations: respect for international order and for the independence of each nation, the safeguard of human rights, and the rejection of everything that divides the world into rival hegemonies.\n71.\tAlready many people are turning towards this Europe, which is rediscovering its universal mission, believing in it and expecting a great deal from it. It is time for Europe to realize this; by asserting itself, it is gradually creating its own responsibilities towards the international community. Europe must understand these new duties and not shirk them.\n72.\tWhatever the economic, political and social problems that face the members of the international community and which are echoed here, Europe must be prepared to make its own response.\n73.\tWe felt this especially strongly at the last UNCTAD meeting in April and May in Santiago, Chile. This meeting was, on the economic level, one of the most keenly awaited events of 1972, and it was held, significantly, in one of the Latin American countries which are so dear to France and which are both strongly marked by European influence and confronted with all the difficulties of profound transformation. Can we not then say that if the Santiago meeting has had positive results it was to the extent that the developing countries found understanding and support from some European nations? But also, that if the results were disappointing it was because this great movement of solidarity is as yet only in its early stages?\n74.\tSome progress was made at the third session of UNCTAD and it is only fair to mention this. In particular, the significance of the joint conclusions which were reached on the need for complete and whole-hearted participation by the developing countries in trade and monetary negotiations in 1973 was widely appreciated. \n75.\tIn addition, I welcome, for example, the agreement on special measures in favor of the least developed among the developing countries.  The fact remains, however, that on two essential points primary commodities and aid the balance-sheet of UNCTAD did not meet our hopes.\n76.\tIn the first case this lack of success and the meeting could have ended in total failure had the African-sponsored draft resolution on the financing of buffer stocks not been adopted was due to the overly abstract search for new formulas on the subject of outlets and prices. Rather than lingering over this debate on theory, would it not be wiser to examine, case by case, the situation of each commodity which is of particular concern to the developing countries in order to take specific measures to remedy the inadequate revenue which these countries receive from their exports?\n77.\tIn this respect the current United Nations Cocoa Conference will put to the test our determination to arrive at a satisfactory solution. The same is true for aid. Must we really reopen discussion on the objectives decided on by common agreement? Would it not be preferable to concentrate our efforts on the means of attaining them? The real problem is whether we shall follow up our resolutions; in other words, whether our political determination matches our intentions. Underdevelopment is not of concern only to international experts; it is primarily our concern, but statesmen need to have the support of public opinion. UNCTAD, at least, has understood this. It is proposing that we have a world development information day. That resolution  will, I am sure, attract the attention of our Assembly.\n78.\tThe need to make Europe's own voice heard; the difficulty in attaining this; progress-depending on the case-towards political co-operation among our Governments since it, as one of the prerequisites of world equilibrium, works in the interest of all peoples and for peace these are the three conclusions that we are compelled to draw when we look at the strife and disruption going on in the world.\n79.\tIn the Middle East can we discern any reason to hope? I, for my part, see two reasons. The first is related to my dominant theme. We have seen emerging and then growing among members of the European Community a similarity of intentions, which has several times led to concerted action. The second shows to what extent the efforts of the European Community, when it affirms its own identity, coincide with those of the international community. The Secretary-General and his special representative do not allow themselves to be discouraged by stagnation, or by delays, or by apparently unchanging attitudes. Indeed, how could they give in to fatalism? How could we ourselves renounce our responsibilities? Has not the past year shown the futility of efforts undertaken outside the United Nations?\n80.\tWe were guided by two clear and simple ideas from 22 November 1967 until 13 December 1971, two ideas on which a peace agreement may simultaneously be based: the occupied territories must be evacuated subject to minor rectifications; and all the States concerned must undertake to conform, under United Nations guarantees, to the rules which regulate peaceful relations among sovereign States. I should like today to give a new form to the appeal which, for the fourth time, I express from this rostrum with all the moral force that continuity gives my country's policy: does any people or country of the Middle East not understand that for its independence to be definitively ensured it must be sheltered from the interplay of outside scheming or rivalries? To this fundamental question there can only be a definitive and sure answer here, not elsewhere.\n81.\tAfrica, too, needs the United Nations. Last year gave us proof of this. In southern Africa why did a sense of hope, still frail, follow a heightened sense of concern? Because the Africans themselves, gathered in the capital of Ethiopia, induced the Security Council to entrust the Secretary-General with a mission, which was to make contact. May this symbolic opportunity be seized. The stakes are far greater than the question of Namibia alone. If international ethics regains its proper place, and the spirit of the Charter along with it, we will no longer have to condemn, year after year, violations of human rights and of the principle of racial non-discrimination, stressing that they are all equally reprehensible, no matter who is the perpetrator and who the victim.\n82.\tIf international morality and the spirit of the Charter regain their proper place, we will no longer have to deplore the fact that Africa's march towards development and unity is hindered by racial antagonisms, which at times cause much bloodshed without evoking sufficient reproach or horror. This ascent towards unity must continue. France regards it with an active goodwill, which extends to associations that are usefully balanced. But no vision of the future can exempt us from the duties inherited from the past. We intend to assume those duties in two ways: as Europeans and as-Frenchmen. As Europeans, true to the spirit and letter of the two Yaounde Conventions, we regard favorably ties of association between the English- speaking African States and our Community, on the sole but essential condition that the rights gained to date by the African countries, which already have ties of association, are preserved. As Frenchmen we are resolved to continue our efforts at co-operation, even if some aspects have to be changed, on the sole condition that our partners and friends continue to want it themselves.\n83.\tBut Asia? Can it be said that the United Nations does not have a voice it can make heard there, or a specific role to play there? That idea might conceivably have been defended before China was seated here. At our last session we were awaiting its delegation with impatience. I have never better understood to what extent that haste was justified than when I had the privilege in the capital of a great people \\\"older than history\\\", in the words of General de Gaulle of greeting and listening to Chairman Mao Tsetung after long talks with the Head of the Chinese Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I had never better understood how essential it was for China to be in our midst, since we want truly to make a patient and sincere effort to establish in Asia a peaceful order based on the reconciliation and coexistence of independent peoples.\n84.\tFor that matter, we are already seeing some necessary dialogs taking place. For its part, Japan, which I have visited since our last session, is contributing to that, and we must thank it. The Koreans are now providing a good example for all of us who believe that, as we have long said, ideological differences can be overcome by peaceful means. That conviction explains why we felt a harsh anomaly in the sudden eruption of the Indian subcontinent. Today we have a twofold duty: to welcome the new State which has just been born and help it to bind up its wounds; then to encourage the warring parties of yesterday to follow to the end the path of reason and reconciliation on which there must be no turning back.\n85.\tBut, above all, will the moment never come when our Organization can put into operation a vast effort of solidarity on behalf of peoples that are victims of the war in Indochina and that are all the more dear to us because they suffer so unjustly? These people of the four States of Indochina want to live in independence in a neutral and peaceful South-East Asia. France knows, of course, from experience how difficult it is to put an end to some conflicts; but I do not hesitate to say that the opportunity to bring to Indochina a peace whose political and military terms can be equally perceived is now at hand. I cannot believe that this opportunity will again be lost. No, I cannot believe that, six years after a certain address delivered in Phnom Penh which history has already proved right-a history which would have been less painful and less bloody if the voice of General de Gaulle had been better heeded.\n86.\tThe survey I have just made leads me to a very natural conclusion: on the one hand, Europe is gradually becoming aware of itself and of the role it must play in serving world equilibrium, and thus peace; on the other hand, the more France realizes that truth, the more she believes that the mission of the United Nations is not only useful but irreplaceable.\n87.\tWhy? We must ask ourselves that question very clearly, for the world has changed to such a degree since the birth of the Organization that it would be a mistake to be satisfied with the old justifications applicable to a time gone by, which preceded the entry into this Organization of most of the States represented here. I shall give my answer immediately: the respective tasks of the European Community and of the United Nations are indeed very different. The Community is an economic power par excellence whose political goals are based on its service to a certain type of civilization. The United Nations is essentially a moral force which cannot have a secular arm because its raison d'etre is to assemble, for the purpose of maintaining or restoring peace, governments representative of all systems, all doctrines, all regimes. But both have one essential thing in common: they tend to prevent the division of the world between two decision-making centers. Understand me well: the rejection of hegemonies, far from creating distrust or hostility towards the very great Powers, is the very prerequisite for a genuine and fruitful dialog. The same President of the French Republic who in a few weeks' time hopes to receive nine Heads of Government received Mr. Leonid Brezhnev in Paris and met with Mr. Nixon in the Azores. With Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Pompidou signed the declaration of 13 principles which makes Franco-Soviet co-operation exemplary and, as the President of the Republic has just said again, gives it capital importance. With Mr. Nixon he discussed the continuance of a friendship as old as the United States itself and ever strengthened by mutual frankness.\n88.\tThe more relations improve between two very great Powers with which we maintain ties of co-operation or alliance, the more we gain, if peace gains therefrom. But, surely, no country among us, even the least powerful, intends to give up the right to choose and to guide its destiny itself.\n89.\tFor that right to be preserved it must be kept from slipping almost from sight, as would happen if left to a natural course of events. That is why so many Mediterranean countries and I am thinking especially of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which are so close to us are showing such concern to have continuous dialog with Europe, in a form still to be determined. The motives that prompt them to look towards Europe are, on the whole, the same as those which justify their attachment to the principles of the Charter.\n90.\tSuch is the spirit in which we propose to participate in the major debates here, in particular those which concern the problems of over-armament and underdevelopment which, for that matter, are connected. But I intend to conclude on the essential thing, which is also the most threatened and challenged. I am aware that I speak on behalf of a country which has certainly not been irreproachable in the course of its lengthy history but which, nearly two centuries ago, proclaimed not the rights of Frenchmen but the rights of man.\n91.\tI mentioned a moment ago that one of the essential tasks of our Organization was to condemn racial discrimination in all its forms and to combat it by the most effective means, that is to say, means consistent with the principles of our Charter. In the same spirit, the French Government last year deposited the instruments of accession to the International Convention on the Elimination of\nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX), annex] and this year submitted to parliament a law, which was unanimously adopted, on the elimination of all expressions of racism.\n92.\tFrance is participating actively, as members know, in the convention work of the United Nations on human rights. We have, in addition, been initiators in the work in which our Organization is currently engaged to draft an international instrument for the protection of journalists on perilous missions. We cannot be indifferent to the fate of those who, in their search for objectivity, sometimes knowingly placing their lives in danger and make an essential contribution to the knowledge of the modern world and to the emancipation of peoples. Often we feel, as I have said, the need for an appeal to public opinion, which alone can jolt people out of their apathy and hasten a solution to the most serious political crises. Is it impossible to hope that increased protection will be given to those who serve the public and serve truth? We hope that this year the Assembly will be sympathetic to our efforts.\n93.\tAt its last session the General Assembly unanimously decided, in resolution 2860 (XXVI), that a Human Rights Day should be celebrated on 10 December 1973 to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n94.\tIt was in Paris that the Declaration was proclaimed on 10 December 1948, and France, true to its long tradition, intends solemnly to celebrate this anniversary.\n95.\tAssuredly, before the immensity of the problems that face the world and the urgency of certain decisions, this celebration will have mainly symbolic value, but the world of today has more need than ever of symbols-symbols strong enough to avenge justice and to comfort brotherhood.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to join those who have preceded me on this podium and to express to you the satisfaction of my delegation on your election to the presidency of this historic session of the General Assembly. Your personal wisdom and experience, as well as the noble traditions of your country, Poland, assure us that the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly will proceed with the least delay and have a fruitful outcome. The Pakistan delegation assures you of its full and active co-operation in the fulfillment of your responsibilities.\n133.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to convey, on behalf of my delegation and my Government, our admiration for the exemplary and able manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, guided the eventful proceedings of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n134.\tMy delegation whole-heartedly shares the sentiments of satisfaction expressed by so many delegations that in Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim we have an able and worthy successor to UThant. Our Secretary-General's efforts to seek solutions to seemingly intractable problems have been relentless; his energy is unbounded; and his manner is forthright and conscientious. His qualities augur well for the fulfillment of the aspiration of the majority of Member States that the United Nations should play a more active role in securing justice and peace in our world.\n135.\tThe last session of the General Assembly closed with the clash of arms still resounding in these halls. No less than the conflict itself, its consequences pose a challenge to the United Nations. Though recent developments have set a trend towards detente and negotiation in international relations, it can hardly be said that this process has assumed global proportions or that the process, though reducing tension in one arena of the world, has not transferred it to another. Nevertheless, no one, whatever his political and ideological affiliations, can belittle the beneficent prospects for world peace opened by the summit meetings between the United States and China and between the United States and the Soviet Union, thanks to the statesmanship, sense of history and initiatives of President Nixon. My delegation would also like to express its profound satisfaction that the recent visit of Prime Minister Tanaka has resulted in the termination of the era of conflict between Japan and China and the resumption of the traditional friendship and co-operation between those two great Asian nations. This accord will provide a new impetus for peace in Asia, the Far East and in the world.\n136.\tElsewhere as well, former disputants have found it possible to initiate a discussion of their differences. The delegation of Pakistan expresses the sincere hope that the negotiations between East and West Germany and between North ,and South Korea will lead to a normalization of their relations on the basis of equity and the aspirations of their peoples.\n137.\tThere is no reason why such negotiations and dialogs cannot result in a just settlement of the war in Viet-Nam. A whole generation in IndoChina has endured the agony of continuing war. It has long been clear that the situation is not susceptible of a military solution. The principle must be recognized that this conflict, as others, can be resolved only in accordance with the right of self-determination of the peoples of IndoChina, who must be assured of the realization of the goals and objectives of the Geneva Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in IndoChina.  It is entirely just that the heroic and invincible people of Viet-Nam, who have made such unparalleled sacrifices for national liberation, should insist on the assurance that what they have suffered and endured for over a generation has not been in vain.\n138.\tThe present climate of discussion and accommodation should be seized upon to promote a process of reconciliation among all Powers. It would be tragic if the current trends are not brought to bear on the resolution of outstanding disputes, for the persistence of a dispute over a period of time renders its solution the more difficult. The history of India-Pakistan relations is an example of this phenomenon.\n139.\tThe new Government of Pakistan has approached all the complex historical and political issues underlying and arising from the recent conflict on the subcontinent with political realism. We are anxious that prejudices and preconceptions of the past, and the memory of suffering, should not form an obstacle to peace. The President of Pakistan has demonstrated his resolve to bring about a change from the path of confrontation to that of conciliation. The Simla Agreement of 3 July last, between India and Pakistan, accepts the principle of non-use of force and of settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It provides for the withdrawal of forces from each other's territories and envisages a step-by-step approach for the settlement of the remaining problems.\n140.\tIt is our determination and hope that that Agreement will open a new chapter in our relations with India, leading to the resolution of all our outstanding problems. It is important in this context that the troop withdrawals should take place forthwith. These were to have been completed within 30 days of the ratification of the Agreement and have already been twice delayed. The view that these withdrawals are in any manner conditional on the prior delineation of the line of control in Kashmir is not warranted by the letter and spirit of the Simla Agreement.\n141.\tThe Simla Agreement also looks forward to a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Pending that settlement the two countries are to respect the line of control resulting from the cease-fire of 17 December 1971, without prejudice to the recognized position of either side. Our position in this regard is well known. It has remained unchanged ever since the resolutions of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan were adopted 24 years ago and India and Pakistan agreed that the future of Jammu and Kashmir should be decided by the people of the state through a plebiscite. The right of self-determination is saAosanct. It is inalienable. The future of Kashmir can be decided only by the people of Kashmir. The will of the people of Kashmir is the objective reality.\n142.\tWe believe that the basis of our future relations with our former eastern province, which is now called \\\"Bangladesh\\\", should also be established through dialog and discussion in accordance with the wishes of our people. We bear our brothers there no ill will. This has been demonstrated by the unconditional release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The President of Pakistan, Mr. Bhutto, has taken other initiatives to facilitate the resolution of the host of problems that have arisen in the wake of the tragic events .of 1971. We find it difficult to understand the precondition which is now imposed that Pakistan must recognize \\\"Bangladesh\\\" before the resolution of our problems can be initiated.\n143.\tThe recognition of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" is different for Pakistan than for other States, It bears upon an important principle. We cannot ignore the fact that the territory which now proclaims itself as \\\"Bangladesh\\\" was an integral part of Pakistan, and that it was sundered from Pakistan by the use of armed force. The events of last year have already eroded the principle of the territorial integrity of States, enshrined in the Charter. There is no doubt a new reality in the subcontinent. But if this precedent is not to imperil the security and integrity of all multinational or multilingual States, it is important that its legitimacy be consecrated, not through Pakistan's coerced recognition of its existence, but through a freely negotiated and just settlement of the issues which interpose serious obstacles to the recognition of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" and its admission to the United Nations.\n144.\tIt is unreasonable to expect Pakistan to support the admission of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" to the United Nations while the two resolutions of the United Nations remain unimplemented. Both General Assembly resolution 2793 (XXVI) and Security Council resolution 307 (1971) called upon the parties to preserve human life.\n145.\tIn its resolution 307(1971) of 21 December 1971, the Security Council called upon \\\"all those concerned\\\" to observe in full the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1949 relating to the wounded and sick, prisoners of war and the civilian population. Resolution 307 (1971) is of a mandatory nature, having been adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, and applies not only to India and Pakistan, but also to the Dacca authorities, who had assumed the powers of government and administration by that time. The third Geneva Convention of 1949, relating to prisoners of war,  enjoins the detaining Power under article 118, to release and repatriate all prisoners of war immediately on the cessation of active hostilities. The text of the Convention, as wall as the authoritative commentaries on it, leave no room for doubt or ambiguity on this point. The obligation is unequivocal, unilateral and unconditional. This position has been most recently reiterated by the Conference of Governmental Experts on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts, which met in Geneva earlier this year under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC].\n146.\tYet, almost 10 months after the cessation of hostilities, over 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war and civilian detainees, including women and children, continue to be held captive in Indian camps. The ICRC, as well as the International Commission of Jurists, has expressed concern over the continuing delay in the release of the prisoners of war.\n147.\tThe treatment of our personnel in captivity is also cause for serious concern. Apart from complaints about insult, provocation and harassment, force has been used against the prisoners on several occasions. A few months back more than a dozen Pakistani soldiers were shot and killed at the Ranchi camp. Last week another 8 were killed and 25 wounded. It is obvious that this latest incident, like the previous one, has occurred because India continues to hold our prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Conventions.\n148.\tThe position that the released and repatriation of our prisoners of war requires the agreement of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" is not supported by the Geneva Conventions. On the other hand, the Dacca authorities refuse even to discuss this question until we recognize \\\"Bangladesh\\\". In this manner our prisoners of war are sought to be used as pawns for securing political concessions from Pakistan, in violation of all legal and moral principles. The Dacca authorities have unnecessarily assumed the responsibility for obstructing the repatriation of our prisoners of war because we are quite prepared to reach an honorable settlement with them.\n149.\tBy obstructing the repatriation of our prisoners of war as well as by failing to take all measures to preserve human life, \\\"Bangladesh\\\" continues to violate its international obligations, including those flowing from Security Council resolution 307 (1971). That resolution creates, by virtue of Article 25 and Article 2, paragraph 6, of the Charter, mandatory obligations for all concerned, including \\\"Bangladesh\\\". It follows, therefore, that fulfillment of the obligation under that resolution is a test of the ability and willingness of the applicant State to carry out its obligations under the Charter, which is one of the qualifications prescribed in Article 4 of the Charter for entry of new members to the United Nations.\n150.\tI should like to express, from this rostrum, our gratification at the just and principled position of the People's Republic of China in defense of the decisions of this Organization and the interest of peace and justice in the South Asian subcontinent. The Security Council was unable to make a favorable recommendation on the application of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" because certain States seemed more anxious to force China to use its veto than to facilitate the entry of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" into our Organization. One cannot but suspect that the precipitate and imprudent attempt to agitate the matter here in the General Assembly is not devoid of similar motives. Unless the Assembly addresses itself to the unresolved problems organically inseparable from admission, its consideration of this question cannot advance the possibility of the admission of \\\"Bangladesh\\\" to the United Nations. My delegation calls upon all Member States, irrespective of the status of their bilateral relations with \\\"Bangladesh\\\", to facilitate, during this debate, the fulfillment of the objective that must remain uppermost, namely, the establishment of a just and durable peace in the subcontinent.\n151.\tWe believe that the effectiveness and, indeed, the future of the United Nations will depend upon its ability to promote not merely peace, but justice and a just peace. It is on the distinction between justice and injustice that we must base our efforts to improve the United Nations machinery for maintaining international peace and security. That this distinction is of fundamental importance is inherent in the Charter. For example, the Charter recognizes the legitimacy of wars of self-defense while outlawing wars of aggression and expansion. This distinction, between justice and injustice, which, unfortunately, is too often overlooked, is contained in Article 2 paragraph 3 of the Charter, which enjoins all Member States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner \\\"that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered\\\".\n152.\tThe delegation of Pakistan favors a serious and constructive review of the Charter in order to explore avenues through which to establish a more effective system of international security. Such a system must obviously not ignore the disparity of power between States. On the other hand, the permanent members of the Security Council should be prepared to render more than lip service to the purposes and principles of the Organization and to demonstrate their determination to insist on the implementation of its mandatory resolutions. That at least one permanent member takes its obligation in this respect seriously is a source of encouragement and hope.\n153.\tThere is a need for such determination in seeking a just solution to the problems of southern Africa. In that region, Portugal continues its oppressive rule over its colonial territories; the illegal racist regime of Ian Smith is firmly entrenched in Southern Rhodesia; in Namibia, despite the energetic efforts of the Secretary-General, there is no sign of progress towards the goal of independence. The policy of apartheid is not only becoming daily more oppressive in South Africa, it is progressively being extended in various forms to Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonial territories. This situation exists because some of the major Powers derive profit in its maintenance and for that reason they prevent any initiative for decisive action by the Security Council. They seem oblivious to the fact that unless the injustice and inhumanity in southern Africa are eliminated, the whole area may soon erupt in a bloody race conflict.\n154.\tInjustice remain to be redressed in the Middle East as well. The Security Council has been unable to secure the implementation of its resolution 242 (1967), much less to devise a solution to the underlying causes of the conflict. The victor of the six-day war continues to be in forcible occupation of conquered Arab lands, including Jerusalem, and, despite the odium of the international community, persists in violating at will the territories of its neighbors. Yet, Israel demands the annexation of the occupied Arab territories in order to maintain \\\"secure frontiers\\\". Both the impunity with which it is able to carry out its aggressive incursions against its Arab neighbors, as well as the revelations of recent months, indicate that it is not Israel, but the Arab countries bordering it, whose security and territorial integrity is in serious jeopardy. Those Member States which have the greatest power and influence in the area and which have failed to deploy them fully in the interests of a just settlement based on the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, owe a great responsibility to the international community and to history for their default.\n155.\tA final solution of the problem of the Middle East will have to be based on justice. The 1967 conflict was but the effect of a cause: the ruthless and unjust displacement of the people of Palestine. Those who seek to maintain the status quo in the Middle East, as well as those who acquiesce in its maintenance, would be well advised to' remember that no structure of peace will endure if it ignores the hunger for justice which drives the Arab people, and in particular the people of Palestine.\n156.\tAn inescapable part of our endeavor to establish a durable system of international security is the effort to control and ultimately eliminate the destructive potential of nuclear and conventional armaments. Pakistan attaches the highest priority to both bilateral and multilateral efforts for disarmament. We have participated actively in the negotiations in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and acknowledge the earnest efforts of its members to bring about agreement on the elimination of chemical weapons. We hope that by next year the members would be able to present the world with such an achievement.\n157.\tHowever, it cannot be denied that hitherto the concrete results of both the bilateral and multilateral negotiations have been meager. The issues with which we have been mainly concerned are not measures for disarmament, but for non-armament. Their most tangible outcome has been the establishment of an uneasy equilibrium between the two super-Powers.\n158.\tIt is time that a beginning was made towards genuine disarmament. My delegation supports in principle the convening of a world disarmament conference at the appropriate time. The conference must so devise its agenda as to secure the participation of all nuclear Powers in its deliberations. To make such participation possible, we need to do more than to establish another forum or to make changes in the existing machinery of negotiations. It is only by concrete and substantial reductions of nuclear and sophisticated weapons that Powers with overwhelming nuclear and other capability will be able to establish their credibility in disarmament negotiations. An important step towards building mutual confidence would be an undertaking not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.\n159.\tThis is not to say that the first strategic arms limitation agreement is not of high significance or that it is not a step which breaks new ground. It is both. At the same time, we cannot but share the anxiety voiced by so many delegations that while quantitative limits have been placed on the build-up of weapons of mass destruction, the nuclear arms race remains unchecked, in fact intensified, in the field of their qualitative development.\n160.\tThe self-defeating nature of this approach and the absence of any possibility of reducing the disparities among the nuclear Powers cannot but exercise a negative influence on any efforts to make the disarmament negotiations all-inclusive. The disparities must first be reduced before universal participation will come to be regarded as compatible with the supreme national interest and security of those nuclear Powers which find the offers to include them uninviting.\n161.\tThere is an urgent need to rectify the current inequity in the distribution of the world's wealth among and within nations. The evolution in our understanding of the issues of poverty and development has indicated that traditional strategies of growth which largely ignore the imperative of distributive justice will not suffice to eradicate inequality, mass poverty and unemployment in the developing countries. The Government of Pakistan has initiated comprehensive economic and social reforms in order to create a framework in which our concern for greater production is complementary to the need for a better distribution of its benefits; and the generation of economic growth and employment is being treated as a primary instead of a secondary objective. These reforms cover a fairly wide spectrum, including land reforms, reforms in the banking and corporate structure, a nationwide integrated rural works and housing program, and fundamental changes in our system of education and health.\n162.\tThe success of strategies designed to secure social justice and generate greater employment in the poor nations can be facilitated by the active co-operation and contribution of the affluent world. Such co-operation is in the common interest of all countries. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, the third session of the United . Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Santiago in April and May, and the efforts being exerted to reform the international monetary system, have all underlined the global interdependencies of the issues of ecology, trade, aid and development. They have indicated the importance of rectifying all imbalances affecting man, whether they result from an excessive and reckless consumption of the world's resources or from inadequate consumption, poverty and hunger.\n163.\tAt Stockholm, where the most immediate concerns were those of the developed countries, the poor nations exhibited an acute awareness of the unity and interdependence of the world. At Santiago, however, on issues of equal if not greater importance for the developing countries, the same sympathy and understanding was not apparent in the attitudes of the developed countries. There can be no double standards in this world. If the developing countries are being called upon to assume responsibilities for preserving the delicate balance of ecology, they cannot at the same time be denied their rightful share of the world's wealth.\n164.\tFor 25 years in this Organization Pakistan's expressions and actions have been inspired by the desire to secure peace and justice in international relations. On innumerable occasions we have incurred the wrath of mighty Powers for cur forthright stand in support of the principles and purposes of the Charter. But in placing its trust in this Organization Pakistan always hoped that its collective strength and moral influence would in time of peril be steadfastly exerted against any threat to our security, sovereignty and territorial integrity.. The United Nations, however, proved helpless in the face of the armed aggression against our country. Yet we continue to hope that a sense of justice will induce the membership of the United Nations at least to contribute constructively to the elimination of the consequences of the use of force against a fellow Member State.\n165.\tAs for our brothers who are today separated from us in what is now called \\\"Bangladesh\\\", we wish them nothing but peace and prosperity and expect of them a similar understanding and sympathy, which we are sure will prevail, in the resolution of our outstanding problems on the basis of justice, equity and the aspirations of our people.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I be permitted first to express to you the warm congratulations of my delegation on your brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. These congratulations go equally to all the other members of the General Committee.\n2.\tThis tribute, which is paid to your country through you as evidence of its attachment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter, is a matter of gratification to us particularly since our two peoples and Governments maintain extremely friendly relations.\n3.\tWe are convinced from the very outset that, through your distinguished qualities and your great experience in international life, the work of the present session will be conducted with wisdom and skill.\n4.\tFurthermore, I should like to take advantage of this pleasant occasion to thank very sincerely the outgoing President, Mr. Adam Malik, who conducted so well the work of the last session.\n5.\tOur acceptance of the Charter of the United Nations implies for all our States an obligation of loyalty to its principles and its ideals. Consequently, it is our duty to join our efforts in order to bring about a world of peace and justice in which the negative forces of hatred and domination will give way to those of understanding and comprehension among peoples, based on the respect of our individual characteristics.\n6.\tLast year I had an opportunity to dwell on certain of the positive aspects of our joint action. However, at the same time, I had occasion to speak out against the persistence of colonialism, the principle of settling conflicts by sheer armed force and the organization of human society on the basis of racial or religious differences. At that time I also deplored the reluctance shown by the international community to meet the elementary needs of the majority of the world's population.\n7.\tIf we wish to respond to the profound aspirations of our peoples, we must promptly eliminate from our practices those principles which run counter to international ethics and at the same time we must strengthen the universal nature of our Organization.\n8.\tUndoubtedly history will remember the political courage with which we have honored the Charter and thus put an end to the conflict caused in our consciences by restoring the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Encouraged by that victory, the international Organization will justly be able to create other opportunities for redress of this sort so that in coming years the voice of all peoples can be heard in this hall in the same fraternal spirit.\n9.\tThe opening of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly is marked by a series of noteworthy events.\n10.\tEurope which, twice in less than a generation, has seen the outbreak of conflagrations which have sorely tried humanity, is preparing for a conference on its security and economic integration. The Treaty on Questions relating to Surface Transport, which was concluded between the two Germanys, on 25 May 1972, in our view constitutes an encouraging sign of a reconciliation between those two States. The ratification by the Bundestag, on 17 May 1972, of the Treaties concluded firstly between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and, secondly, between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland, leads us to believe that the desire to work for peace and international security has definitely triumphed over mistrust and suspicion.\n11.\tUndoubtedly, the threat of what philosophers have called our \\\"cosmic suicide\\\" still exists. Our horizon is not yet totally free of the atomic clouds which have darkened it since the end of the Second World War. Although it is unreasonable to draw any final conclusion about arrangements whose nature is not yet known to us entirely, we would note, as an important contribution to detente, the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, which was concluded at Moscow on 26 May 1972 between the Government of the United States of America and the Union of\u2003Soviet Socialist Republics. The arms race has not stopped nor has it slackened either in the Soviet Union or the United States. These agreements, however, serve as an example; and unless there is a misconception as to the role which each of these States must play in the harmonious evolution of international relations, they will have opened up the way to other forms of agreement and to the possibility of using atomic power for the benefit of mankind.\n12.\tOur constant concern to abide by the noble ideals of the Charter and to preserve mankind from the scourge of war has led us during the past session to adopt the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [see resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex], which 169 States signed on 10 April 1972 in Moscow, London and Washington.\n13.\tThis series of important events proves that a minimum of political far-sightedness can lead to results which bring us closer to the ideals of the Charter, to which, as I said, we have all freely subscribed. We need only refer to the holding of meetings of the Security Council in Africa and the important decisions taken by the ninth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of Africa Unity [OAU], held at Rabat in February 1972, and the last Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Georgetown. Guyana, in August 1972.\n14.\tThe improvement of international relations, which is the bounden duty of each of our States, is one of the major concerns of the present day world. The division of the world into two antagonistic blocs seems to be giving way to a certain multi-polarity, which may lead us progressively to democratize relations among States. Unfortunately, this encouraging turn of events has been marred by reactions which have been dictated either by false concepts of national honor or by philosophies and policies that are backward and dangerous because they attack the fundamental values of human civilization.\n15.\tThis explains why the Government of the Republic of Mali was indignant at the deterioration of the situation in the Indochina peninsula; why we refuse to sanction the law of the force of arms in the settlement of disputes among States; and, finally, why we shall never compromise with colonialist and racist regimes.\n16.\tWe had sincerely believed that political wisdom would have prompted us to consider realistically the heroic struggle of the people of South Viet-Nam for its genuine independence and for the enjoyment of the rights attached to the sovereignty of a people which continues to confront the forces of imperialist aggression by a united will and resistance never before equaled. This people more than any other knows the price of peace because it has long suffered from unjust wars, and the seven-point proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam illustrate this will to build a just and peaceful society in a world free of bombs, napalm and defoliants. The Government of the Republic of Mali cannot tolerate the idea that such proposals have been responded to by actions of systematic destruction of South Vietnam, by the intensification of indiscriminate bombings of the economic infrastructure of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, and by attempts to strangle this country by mining, against all legal norms, its ports and its territorial waters.\n17.\tThe courage of a people which is resolutely struggling for its freedom is only equaled by its wisdom. The Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam has demonstrated this once again by its declaration of 11 September 1972, proposing the creation of a tripartite provisional government of national reconciliation, representing the political, administrative and military reality of the country.\n18.\tIt cannot be over-emphasized that it is up to the Vietnamese people, and up to that people alone, to choose the political, economic and social framework in which it intends to live. All countries which love peace and justice must help that people to achieve unity so that reason may prevail over brute force,\n19.\tWe are witnessing on the same Asian continent a positive turn in the Korean situation. The Koreans, mindful of their national identity and their common destiny, have begun, in accordance with their Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 [A/8727, annex I] on the reunification of their country, talks for whose success the international community must give its full assistance. Our Organization, which has been illegally involved in the war of aggression of which the Korean people is the victim, must bring to bear all its political and moral force to achieve the peaceful unification of this country. The Koreans have taken a significant step towards the solution of their internal crisis. Let us not delay events by continuing to impose upon them the presence of military forces which use our emblem for purposes of prestige and hegemony. That is precisely why my delegation regrets the postponement of the discussion of the Korean question to the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n20.\tThe device by means of which certain States have deferred from year to year the examination of this agenda item deceives no one. However, we dare to hope that our worthy Assembly has not been fooled by this and will not follow them in their fraud. It must take the opportunity offered by the device begun between the two parties to speed up, by concrete actions, the process leading to the solution of this unfortunate crisis, which for more than 20 years has tried the heroic Korean people. The three-point proposal of Marshal Kim II Sung, the well-loved and respected leader of revolutionary Korea, at least opens up the way to this.\n21.\tPeace is therefore within reach in Korea. In order to safeguard it, it would be sufficient for us to help the parties to accelerate the process of peaceful reunification which is going on. We, for our part, remain convinced that our Organization will no longer shirk its responsibilities in Korea.\n22.\tThe continuing improvement in international relations means that no provision of the Charter may be violated with impunity. Hesitations, delays in taking decisions and tongue in cheek commitments at the time they are implemented have created areas of extreme tension in the world. The Middle East gives us a disturbing example of this. The announcement by the Secretary-General on 10 July that the Jarring mission had been resumed created a certain optimism, which the latest Israeli raids against Lebanon and Syria soon dispelled. Only the full application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) can lead to a just and lasting peace in this sorely tried region of the world. The elimination of Israeli aggression against the Arab peoples and of its consequences demands firm and energetic action by the international community. Our Organization cannot leave in frustration those thousands of Palestinians, who, like everyone else, are entitled to live in their own home and to participate fully in the political, economic, social and cultural evolution of their homeland. Israel, which continues to block the process of the settlement of the crisis, must understand that the United Nations, which it challenges with such arrogance, cannot indefinitely remain indifferent to the illegal occupation by Israeli troops of the Arab territories of Golan, Sinai, Gaza and Trans- Jordan, which it has practically annexed. We should like to assure our Arab brothers of the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Syrian Arab Republic, Lebanon, the Kingdom of Jordan and Palestine of our total solidarity in the struggle they are waging with such determination to defend the territorial integrity of their homeland and to affirm their national identity.\n23.\tThe struggle against the injustices characteristic of our society is a global one. It has no limitation in time or in space. Those political leaders who would be satisfied with maintaining a balance while bombs and napalm are churning up and burning the lands of Asia, the Middle East and Africa, have understood nothing about the aims and the objectives of the Charter. Putting an end to colonization is one of these priority objectives. If we refer to the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, we read:\n\\\"The full and complete implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization remains a major goal of the United Nations.\\\" [A/8701/ Add.l, p. 4.]\n24.\tIn the opinion of the delegation of Mali, there will be no independence or freedom in Africa as long as the peoples of Guinea (Bissau), Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Rhodesia and South Africa remain under colonialist and racist domination.\n25.\tWith reference to the hysterical Portuguese colonialism, Mario Soares has aptly written in his work Le Portugal baillonne:\n\\\"In fact, the only specific feature of Portuguese colonialism in comparison with other European colonialisms derives essentially from the financial and mental poverty of the settlers and the economic underdevelopment of the metropolitan country, which itself is a colony of the great Powers.\\\"\n26.\tThe Portuguese Government is not competent to teach freedom and the values of any civilization whatsoever; for otherwise, it would have applied those principles to Portugal itself. Africa is not deceived about the true intentions of the Powers members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] which provide it with weapons.\n27.\tThe report of the United Nations Special Mission of inquiry which was sent to Guinea (Bissau) [A/8723/Rev.l, chap. X, annex I] has enlightened the world as to the scope of the barbarous acts carried out by the Portuguese colonial army. This session of the General Assembly should focus its full attention on two aspects of the questions raised in that document. First, it should be noted that vast areas of the territory have been liberated and that the victory of the freedom fighters over the Portuguese army is irreversible. Secondly, we must determine the specific nature of the help to be given to the people of Guinea (Bissau), which should be both political and material.\n28.\tThe illegal regime of Ian Smith and the racists of Pretoria are warring openly against the international community. The Salisbury rebels have drawn closer to Portugal and to South Africa in order better to inculcate racial hatred and methods of repression.\n29.\tHowever, despite the threats, the brutalities, the imprisonments and the assassinations perpetrated by the illegal regime of Ian Smith, the overwhelming majority of the Rhodesian population has pronounced itself against the Home-Smith agreements,  which were only intended to formalize the domination of the white racists in Zimbabwe.\n30.\tThe United Nations, for its part, guided by the principles of the Charter and specifically by the provisions of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), should henceforth direct its action in Rhodesia in the light of the most recent proposals made by the African National Congress, namely, the convening of a constitutional conference on the political future of the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. That is the only initiative which can possibly put an end to the chain of violence in which the Rhodesian rebels wish to involve the country, in order to dominate it further.\n31.\tThe responsibility of Great Britain, as administering Power in the Rhodesian question, remains unimpaired.\n32.\tWe are not unaware of the fact that the moral, political, economic and military assistance which certain Powers give to the Portuguese colonialists, to the rebels in Rhodesia and to the racist Government of South Africa is utilized to put down the nationalists and to strengthen white power in southern Africa. Is it not with the weapons which are provided under these alliances that the Government of South Africa has brutally repressed the demonstrations by theologians and university students directed against the odious regime of apartheid? NATO, of which South Africa is a vassal, has thus become a system of aggression against Africa. We need only refer to the belligerent statements of the Government of Pretoria and to recall its attacks against Zambia and the United Republic of\nTanzania and its pacts with the Government of Portugal and the illegal regime of Southern Rhodesia to be convinced of this.\n33.\tNot content with oppressing and humiliating the Colored people in South Africa, the Pretoria Regime has extended the abscess of apartheid to Namibia, which it continues to occupy despite the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.  This illegal occupation, which is an insulting challenge to our Organization, is the fruit of the plan for hegemony which has always been nurtured by that retrograde regime.\n34.\tThe impotence of the United Nations in the face of the arrogance of those who preach apartheid is inadmissible. It must act promptly to see to it that the sacred right of the Namibian people to self-determination is upheld. In this way it will shoulder its responsibilities towards the international community.\n35.\tThe lack of co-operation of certain major Powers in the implementation of United Nations decisions against the white racists of southern Africa is not such as to make our task easier.\n36.\tThe coalition of the racists and of those who support colonialism must be met by a permanent aggressive front consisting of those who believe in the value of human dignity and who refuse to let the world be pushed to the brink of the abyss.\n37.\tThe recognition of the legitimacy of the struggle against colonialism so often proclaimed by our Organization should finally cease to be a mere declaration of intention and should become a fact.\n38.\tThe Assembly of Heads of State and Government held by the OAU, which unanimously decided at Rabat to double the budget for liberation movements, wished thus to show what could be done to quench the murderous flame which Portugal has lit in southern Africa and which it continues to fan in collusion with the racists of South Africa and Rhodesia.\n39.\tThe Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries, which met in Georgetown, after having stressed the indivisibility of peace, adopted a position on the question of giving assistance to liberation movements, which, we are convinced, will have a certain impact on the United Nations.\n40.\tThe year 1972 undoubtedly has been rich in events which might be attributed to our Organization, whose purpose it is to bring men and peoples closer together.\n41.\tIn point of fact, the great nuclear Powers have for some time now demonstrated a certain desire, if not to put an end to the arms race, at least to hold it in check. But the progress achieved in the limitation of nuclear arms would be completely pointless if it were not followed up by general disarmament measures.\n42.\tThe objectives set for the Disarmament Decade are far from being achieved, and we can only note with some disquiet the observation of the Secretary-General:\n\\\"Neither has the arms race been halted nor perceptibly slowed down. In fact, the armaments race has spiraled to a level higher than ever before.\\\" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 3.]\n43.\tInternational security, we have stated, is indivisible. Disarmament concerns us all, and it is regrettable to note that the composition of the United Nations committee entrusted with this matter does not take into account the evolution of the forces prevailing in the world.\n44.\tFurthermore, the present formula of co-chairmanship of that body should be replaced by a more democratic formula which would fully involve all its members in the responsibility for its work. Today more than ever the need for a world disarmament conference is being felt. In order for such a conference to achieve any results, it must be carefully prepared by inviting all States to it.\n45.\tThe present trend marked by the frenzied arms race should be reversed so that the astronomical sums absorbed by arsenals can be released and devoted to the economic, social and cultural progress of man. It is the welfare and stability of the world which are at stake.\n46.\tThe democratization of international relations affects the future of the world as a whole. It applies both to the political as well as to the economic areas. In the particular case of trade, it may well open the way to undreamed-of possibilities of co-operation for the well-being of our peoples.\n47.\tUnfortunately, neither the discussions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], nor in the first and second sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], held in Geneva and New Delhi respectively, have led to any concrete measures to improve relations between the industrialized Powers and the developing countries.\n48.\tThe third session of UNCTAD, which- was held in Santiago, Chile, in April and May of 1972, has brutally revealed this fact to the world. The results of the work were so far below expectations that Mr. Tibor Mende, referring to the reluctance of the rich countries to contribute to the solution of the problem of under-development, wrote recently: \\\"Henceforth it is less a question of resolving the problem than of learning to live with it.\\\"\n49.\tDespite the resolutions adopted by the international community to overcome under-development, it is still true that the combined gross national product of the developing countries, which is on the order of $700,000 million, continues to decline whereas that of the industrialized countries, estimated at $2 million million, is progressing by approximately $100,000 million per year.\n50.\tThe net earnings of international trade could have reduced this unfortunate trend towards the excessive impoverishment of the technically backward countries; but, unfortunately, here also they are hampered by the continuing deterioration of the terms of trade. Their immense mining resources are thus outrageously exploited by the industrialized countries solely to, benefit international capitalism. Therefore it is imperative to prepare a code for international trade relations which would ensure that we could manage our own resources as we saw fit.\n51.\tThe first efforts of the countries of the third world, therefore, should be directed at the exploitation of our mining resources and potentialities in order first and foremost to serve our populations. This implies necessarily that our sovereignty should be effectively exercised over our natural wealth.\n52.\tThe assistance of the industrialized countries to the developing countries, which was far from achieving percentage-wise the figure recommended by the various resolutions of our Organization, is still tending to decline while the conditions for repayment of debts are set very strictly. This has reached such a point that the developing countries are now faced with a situation of indebtedness which does not allow them any possibility for development.\n53.\tThe negative effects of these facts on our economies are further aggravated by monetary tensions; and, as if it had not been sufficiently proved that establishing an international order would require the co-operation of everyone, solutions to monetary crises are at present being sought without the effective participation of the developing countries. International monetary reform can be viable only if it is established on the basis of a world indicative plan in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2218 (XXI) on the first United Nations Development Decade.\n54.\tThe solutions which have been advocated within the context of the Second United Nations Development Decade will have little effect if there is no political will, without which no planning is feasible.\n55.\tThe over-all analyses made of the economies of the developing countries, unfortunately, do not enable world public opinion to grasp the serious human realities and social problems of the countries which are considered among the least developed of the low-income countries. The models which were generally put forward to stimulate the economic growth of the developing countries do not take into account the specific nature and the tremendous scope of their needs.\n56.\tOver and above the reinforcement and intensification of the measures already taken for their benefit, the international community should hold free and open discussions with these countries in order to establish precise programs which would make possible the attainment of the goals set in the various resolutions and recommendations.\n57.\tI should like now to take up a very timely question which the General Assembly, acting on the initiative of the Secretary-General of our Organization, has decided to examine. Some have already stated that this question will constitute the central focus of our discussions. Undoubtedly it cannot be denied that this is an important issue which is of concern to all mankind, but let us not forget that it is, above all, a particularly complex question, with multiple ramifications, whose examination should, therefore, be taken up in a spirit of absolute serenity and great objectivity.\n58.\tWe should like to put stress on this final wording of the title of the item and thus on the need to study first and foremost the underlying diverse causes of this phenomenon before trying to determine at all costs measures to eliminate it.\n59.\tNo one can approve of violence, wherever it may be practiced, particularly if when it is unleashed it endangers or even takes innocent human lives, but it must be realized that we will oppose any attempt thus to jeopardize by this means the actions undertaken by various liberation movements, whether in Africa, in Asia, in the Middle East or elsewhere.\n60.\tThose are the few comments my delegation wished to make about the international situation. We have no doubt that we share these views with most of the delegations present here, which are themselves concerned over the deterioration of the internal relations of contemporary society in the political, economic, social and cultural areas. In point of fact, man, after having revolted against the injustices continuously inflicted on him, has assumed the role of judge. This explains the recrudescence of violence which characterizes the world and the resultant climate of total insecurity facing mankind. Hence for us it is much more a matter of seeking to remedy this state of affairs than of condemning or stigmatizing the phenomenon, which is simply growing because iniquities continue to exist.\n61.\tWe realize today that the world is so interdependent that no individual and no country can be sheltered from the consequences of acts of despair and hysteria. Indeed, we have never felt so much as today that the destiny of mankind is a common one. Therefore, let us pool our resources in order to hasten the transformation our society so sorely needs.\n62.\tWe must resolutely engage in a great crusade against injustice and against all causes of insecurity which daily jeopardize peace and human lives and which are called imperialism, colonialism, apartheid, hunger, disease, illiteracy, poverty and selfishness, to cite only the most familiar ones. We would thus be contributing to the achievement of a world of peace and happiness to which all our peoples so strongly aspire. Mali is determined to work for the realization of this great project when is, furthermore, in full accord with the historic mission of our generation.\n63.\tTherefore, Mr. President, let us see to it that the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, over which you are presiding with such perspicacity and wisdom, will mark the point of departure of this great transformation. The interest of peace and the survival of humanity should stimulate our efforts to this end. Let us act therefore before it is too late.\n"
